"We could use your opinion, House, or at least your attention.",Jack Cannon is not dead. It's worse. Ten books leading up to a final confrontation. She ends it on a cliffhanger. Who does that?
People who want to sell you the 11th.,"She was gonna kill herself. This is the final Jack Cannon. Nothing gets resolved. Who's his father? Who killed his brother? How'd he get that damn scar on his cheek, and why is he obsessed with yo-yos?"
Is there anything in it that pertains to our case?,Yeah. I know why she wanted to kill herself.
Yeah. I know why she wanted to kill herself.,"His mentor, Helen Rutherford, has contracted a serious illness, which consists of joint pain, fatigue, sensitivity to light, and depression."
How do we know this mentor character's really Alice?,Helen dies halfway through the book. Shoots herself in the head... to save Jack from having to care for her.
If we add those to the symptoms we've seen and the pericardial effusion... it's lupus.,Can't be lupus.
"Given good! !ish behavior and 8 of 12 months time served, we have the discretion to grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now. Are you sorry about what you did?",Yes.
Yes?,"Well, that's the correct answer, isn't it?"
Are you trying to annoy us?,"No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here."
We need you to show us remorse.,Is that how our system works? Release the best actors? I shudder to think what that world would be like.
You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's House and then fled the country for three months.,"I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like Every Friday, and I saw Everyone else move into the living room."
They could've moved back.,Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them.
"Shut up. We got an order to reduce overcrowding. But let me be clear ï¿½ you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't Even remember, you can Park your ass here for four more months. So forget being sorry. Can you stay out of trouble for five days?",Yes.
Gather for meds! Asofa!,Yeah.
Why you keep helping him out?,"Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?"
Mendelson!,He's on 80 mg of Propranolol. That's 40.
No worries. I like my nurses naughty.,"I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit."
"Hey, House. Check out our new brand, huh?",You really got a thing for swastikas! Mendelson. Like an ironic thing?
It's a GerMan name.,"So's ""House."" I'm Jewish. Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy."
Knight to King's Bishop three.,Queen to King's Bishop sEven.
"Hey. You're House, right? I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my kneesï¿½","You know what's weirder? It's how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it. Although, to be fair, I am large."
"You know what's weirder? It's how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it. Although, to be fair, I am large.","Hi, Rollo. I realize this is pRobably a rhetorical question ï¿½ Why are you stealing my stuff?"
"Hey, House. I heard you're on short time. You won't need this.","You heard about my parole, but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna. Put it back."
Nuh-uh.,"Really? You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds and who's carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon."
"You wanna get back at these guys? Get out alive on Friday. All right, now go to work, House. Oh, and that was Checkmate, right?",Yep.
"I heard you're on that short time, House?","If you like tuna, you're a little late."
],It's not gonorrhea.
I didn't say it was.,"Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fEver, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription."
House used to be a doctor.,Not going back. And that look of shock is elitist and offensive. Doctors can be degenerates. This is America. There's subtle eyebrow loss. It's lupus.
"Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.",Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.
"No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.","""Usually""? Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work. You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?"
You don't wanna mess with Stomper. He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.,You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?
Y-you're missing my point.,I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.
"Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz. He barely said a couple of words and set the boy off. Oh, no. I know that look.","Hey, Stomper."
Where's my stereo?,I brought it to your cell.
It ain't there.,I was just getting to that part. Rollo followed me in and took it.
No way Rollo'd diss me like that.,"Way. I don't wanna start any rumors, butï¿½"
But what?,"Well, he was all, you know, ""I can take Stomper."" And I was all, ""how come?"" And he was all, ""'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month."" In fact, he actually called you ""Stompee,"" with an ""ee."" I think his gist was!"
That was stupid.,"Is that, like, a synonym for ""clEver""? By the time they get out of solitary, I'll be teaParkng physics at the University of Fiji."
Don't.,"This another pet? 'Cause it's gonna end badly. Again. Remember we talked about this? At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily. I think it was eerily. ""Eerily"" felt like the best-case scenario."
"This another pet? 'Cause it's gonna end badly. Again. Remember we talked about this? At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily. I think it was eerily. ""Eerily"" felt like the best-case scenario.",Hey. Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.
"Oh, now you wanna help me. 'Cause that doctor didn't beliEve you?","Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears. Now, let's get this over with."
"Yeah. That's Nicole. She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job. Her mom hates me, so she can't visit, she ain't accepting my calls.","Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old."
You don't beliEve me?,Belief implies a lEvel of giving a crap that I am nEver gonna aParkEve. Pull down your pants.
Belief implies a lEvel of giving a crap that I am nEver gonna aParkEve. Pull down your pants.,"Hey. It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh."
I checked you out. You were a pretty big deal. What went wrong?,Something very obvious and very boring.
Drug related? Forging prescriptions?,"Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone. Name should've been a giveaway. I'll send him up."
Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?,"Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting."
Why would you say any of that?,"Your shoes ï¿½ different, expensive pair Every day, but nEver leather, which means you're both rich and liberal. Antique locket ï¿½ it's unpolished gold. Not some hipster thing. It's a family heirloom, which means old money. Osler scarf ï¿½ only on Fridays, which means you did your residency at Hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indiCate. And your eyes ï¿½ the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis. So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus."
Parole? You didn't tell me.,"I didn't want a big, emotional scene."
"But you know what the rules are. On short time, tax goes up.",How Many do you want?
All of 'em.,"Come on, Mendelson. I should be on six a day. I get four, and I give you two. Fine. Get one in my cell after lights-out. Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that's 11 in all."
"I count 20. You knew on Monday, you get out Friday. Five days. You should've told me earlier.","They give out four a day, Max."
You'll figure something out. You're a creative guy.,"What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?"
"Oh, you could P.C. up. But then you'll get out, and unlike you! I got friends on the outside.",Porter.
"Doc, what ya need? I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week. Got some new girly mags too.","I was thinking of something more! Vicodin-y. At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon."
"That's pricy, but it can be done. How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?",I am peep-less.
"This is just you haggling, right?","No. I mean, you Ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?"
"All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out. I'm gonna need to see some tuna. I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereoï¿½",Just get 'em to me as soon as you can.
Just get 'em to me as soon as you can.,What happened?
"I was trying to use the phone. I justï¿½I just got jostled a little, that's it.",Who hit you?
Huh!,It's not lupus.
Is that good?,Does it feel good?
Sick.,"No, I'm just going through a bit of withdrawal. I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days."
No. Fix him.,It's not lupus. He broke his arm.
"Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.",He was in a jostle.
"'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.",That's why he'd lie to the guards. He's got no reason to lie to me.
Huh.,"See? There are those eyes again. How about a viral syndrome? Or MRSA? No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast. But reaction to meds could. May I?"
May you what? Make me lose my job by showing you a Patient file? But why don't you assume no recent meds?,How long can I assume that he's been smoking? Based on his yellow fingers.
You're thinking lung cancer. Metastatic. I'll x-ray him on Friday. We share a traveling x-ray maParkne with two other clinics.,I'm out of here on Friday.
He's not.,"Well, how about! if he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy. Start him on blood thinners."
Very interesting practice you must've run. No need for tests. No need for proof. Where are you going?,To the proof store.
You were right about Nicole.,About me not caring? I thought so.
It wasn't her mom. It was her. She doesn't wanna talk to me.,"Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity. Cancer can wait. Hey, heading out to the yard?"
Mm-hmm.,You mind trying to find me a cricket?
The ol' swap trick? You don't think that will piss off your cellie Even more when he figures it's a different bug?,"I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo."
"Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide I'm surprised we're alive.",Good point. Hey. How's it coming?
"It ain't. The Confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats. They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin. Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.",Now try an inch to the left. Hear the difference?
Yeah!,It's called an acoustical shadow. It means he's got a tumor.
How did you find that without a stethoscope? I didn't Even know you could do this!,Start the blood thinners.
No.,Yeah
All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.,Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right?
Which apparently really bugs you. I could do a clotting test.,That's! that's a good idea.
"Are you really leaving medicine? What are you gonna do? You know, for someone who asks as Many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.","Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics. You Ever heard of dark matter? The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe! it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect. It's been theorized but no one's Ever proved it exists."
"So, uh, so you wanna research it? Why?",It's the greatest mystery there is ï¿½ the theory of Everything.
And completely divorced from huManity.,"Well, me and huManity, we got together too young."
Tsk. You have a gift. There is something in this world you are undeniably great at. You can read people. You-you understand them. You gotta go back to medicine.,"Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy."
Cool.,"Jiminy didn't Parkrp much last night. If it's a disease, then he's six inches under. But this could also be pesticide poisoning! Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat. See? Just so much and no more."
"Jiminy didn't Parkrp much last night. If it's a disease, then he's six inches under. But this could also be pesticide poisoning! Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat. See? Just so much and no more.","Mm! This is where you say ""thank you."" Or I say thank you for not killing me. Thank you."
Hey. The x-ray didn't show any tumors. The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma. I'm thinking ï¿½ you all right?,I'm fine.
Ibuprofen?,It's not gonna help.
You can look at the Patient file if you want.,You trust me?
Any reason I shouldn't?,"You're really not good at reading people, are you? Or buildings."
People are compliCated. And people change.,"Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second. But if it'll get me the file!"
"If we add ""clotting disorder"" to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.",This guy's the only one with symptoms. It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.
The laundry room. So maybe a solvent or detergent?,Can you get me an escort to gather samples?
Dr. Adams. Why does this Man have a file?,You need to get cotton swabsï¿½
ï¿½ but not now. I got something to do.,"You're a prisoner on tier time. By definition, you have nothing to do."
"Call her family, her friends, her work. I'm gonna get through Eventually.","You're moving slower. You're getting weaker. This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood."
"Look, my girl's more important.","She's not your girl, you idiot. She was the girlfriend of a loser drug dealer. Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years? You think she should? There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people. Your life outside is over. Your friends, your girl, Everyone you worked with, they've moved on."
Get out of my House. Get out!,Where's Sykes?
Off at his other clinics.,Great. I'm gonna go through the laundry. Give me some swabs.
No.,What? He yelled at you for letting me see the file? You'll get over it. A few years of therapyï¿½
Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?,"Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills. You obviously don't care what I did. You care that I lied to you. You feel jilted."
I feel stupid. It-it doesn't Even make sense. Why are you doing time? You didn't have any priors. You didn't hurt anyone.,I had a bad Lawyer.
I'm sorry. We can't talk about this case anymore.,Uhhh!
We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.,"I-I-I can't get all 20, but once I get outï¿½"
"Give us a minute. Why do you think I'm on buspirone? The stress! I get the runs almost Every day. Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye. So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass! it just wouldn't be good for my health. See you tomorrow.",I need your help. You have any matches?
"No, that's serious contraband. What are you planning to do?",What about a stick of gum?
Sure.,I'm gonna need that too.
Why?,"Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and nEver write with? This is plan ""B."""
What happened to your cheek?,What is it?
"Hey. Hey, House. You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab orï¿½",You're confusing me with the clinic again.
What? You're abandoning me?,"As soon as you leave, I am."
Why? What changed?,"I'm just done. No you, no medicine, no fixing people. Done. Now get out."
No!,Your lips are swelling. Open your mouth. Did you just eat something?
"Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee!",You allergic to anything? Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock. Guard! Dammit. I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.
"House, get away from him.",He's having an allergic reaction. He can't breathe.
Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.,"Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy. Come on, Man. You know I'm a doctor."
What's wrong with him?,I have no idea.
I have no idea.,Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you. I need to be taken into protective custody.
Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you. I need to be taken into protective custody.,Wow. That was great. I think I really dodged a bullet there.
You don't need P.C.?,"Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise."
"Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.","It wasn't the food. It was the heat. It's mastocytosis. It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank."
It's a possibility. I'll run some blood tests. Thank you.,"No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work. Just give him five aspirin."
"If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.","You do understand the meaning of the word ""confirm."""
It's not.,"Well, what do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?"
I'm not taking the risk.,"It's his risk to take. If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?"
No.,You're a moron and a coward. I'll do it myself.
"Dr. House. Did you get all the Vicodin you needed? I'm not an idiot. That fire, the bruise on your face! I talk to prisoners. I know about exit taxes. You're clearly getting squeezed.",I need 20. And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.
We'll take care of Nick.,You can't if you're not willing to doï¿½
"Well done. If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.",You're absolutely right.
Come on. Come on!,Thanks for getting me to the clinic.
Take him out.,C.O.! We have a little pRoblem here!
"I need backup, I need backup! We got a big fight here.",Alvarez!
Hey! Sit down! Back off.,Where's the aspirin?
"House, open up! This is a direct order!","Yeah, it's always a direct order. Eight months. Haven't heard an indirect order in here."
"They're gonna revoke your parole. They're gonna charge you with extra crimes. You'll be here six more months, minimum!",Sorry. Distracted. You were saying?
"I checked your file. You didn't have a bad Lawyer. You had no Lawyer. You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself. Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?",No.
Then why are you doing this?,"'Cause I have a gift. Once you drink this, you should get an attack almost immediately. That is, if I'm right."
You just bought yourself months in solitary. Was it really worth it?,"If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't."
No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup!,Just drink it! Drink it!
Yes. Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.,"Come on, just a little more time."
"Get up, House.",Must be some mistake. I specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.
Some VIP visitor. Dean of Medicine from your old hospital.,I've had dreams about this. I'm going to assume this is another one.
Get up.,I can refuse to see any visitor I want. Tell the Dean that I don't want to see her.
He said you'd say that.,He?
He?,What's the hiring policy over there? All ass based?
I can get you out of here.,Not unless that file has a file in it.
Judge's order for your immediate release.,I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago. The math is pretty basic.
"We have a crisis. Which, is good news for you. You're out tonight on conditional parole. The condition being that you're employed by me, at PPTH.","No, thanks. You think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life? For either of us?"
"And it only has 12 hours left. No pulse, no body. No ability to answer questions. It's your perfect Patient.","I did pay for the room for the whole week, but!"
"Donor's an 18-year-old college kid back from Hofstra. Goes to a homecoming party with his buddies, hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor. Asystole in the E.R. No pulse. No blood circulating. His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast. Surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance. The team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation. Buys 24 hours to fix it, 12 of which have passed. We still have no clue what's wrong.","Nice painting. Blues and greens. Calming, but with a hint of nurturing. Totally offsets the stench of suffering and death. Where's my Patient? We need to not talk."
ICU isolation room. The transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.,Great. Take this.
How about you drop it in your office?,"I completely understand and, almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine. On the other hand! Seriously?"
"Get this straight. You break the law, you go back to jail. Scam extra Vicodin, back to jail. Flout my authority, make the hospital look bad, back to jail. I own you.","Yes, massa."
"See, that, would be an example.",When did Cuddy leave?
She gave her notice the day after your incident. Took a jobï¿½,Don't need the details.
Ortho needed more space. You're this way.,Where's my stuff?
No idea.,What about my team?
"Pathetic. The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment. The fourth thing you said was, ""where's my old environment?"" It's been a year, Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on. The world does that sometimes.","No, it doesn't."
Hi.,I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.
I'm not sloppy seconds.,"3:00 a.m. If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have"
"Yes, I was on call for neurology.","Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help. Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work. Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone."
I am not a reject.,Then go back to neurology.
ARDS secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis. FiO2 is 93%ï¿½,"Prison! Sorry, I thought I heard Everyone else think that. I was in prison, you see. It was a long time ago, but still, you're curious. NEver was raped, not raped-raped. Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped. Well, now that we've got that completely behind us."
"Sorry, Dr. House, welcome back.",Is there cake? Any alveolar exudate?
No. The lungs are dry.,"Well it's not ARDS. It's the autumn. Its tick borne disease season. EhrliParkosis causing bronParkalitis. You'll appreciate that I left the ""idiots"" subtextual."
"Blood smear was clear, and we ""idiots"" treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.",Cocaine.
Tox screen was clean.,Dead men don't pee. Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine. Coke nEver got past the lungs. Also explains the motorcycle crash. Idiots.
Let's get the lungs on treatment.,"Great idea. Unless you're wrong. And by you, I mean me. Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs. I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word. Kato, get Black Beauty and meet me out front. We're gonna find the dead kid's stash."
"Great idea. Unless you're wrong. And by you, I mean me. Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs. I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word. Kato, get Black Beauty and meet me out front. We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.","Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer Patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club."
Excellent deduction.,You're the reason I'm out of the big House. Doesn't quite make up for nEver visitingï¿½
Springing you was Foreman's idea. I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.,It amounts to the same thing. You wanted me back.
"See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.","Strong, emotional reaction. I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you. How's your wrist?"
"Healed, thank you.",I was wrong. I went to prison. I paid the price.
You're a changed Man.,I said I was wrong. I didn't say I changed. I haven't. Neither have youï¿½
We pRobably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this. Their son just died.,"Bright side ï¿½ they're pRobably up weeping. Hey, we both assaulted our bosses. It's like we're twins."
I'd really rather not!.,"Okay, I'll go first. My boss dumped me. And yours what? Called you his Parkna doll? Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan? Assumed you have a huge penis? I have no idea what flavor you are, so I thought I'd just cover the spread."
"My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean, and my boss grabbed my behind.","Behind what? Oh, yeah, your ï¿½ grabbed your tushy. So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped."
"I don't have a boyfriend. It's my parents. If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.",Your parents know your call schedule?
I live with them.,Right. No issues there.
I told you my son didn't do cocaine.,Druggies are not known for their honesty. Trust me on this one.
"Hey, take it easy. Steve loved all thatï¿½",Sorry. But we're on a clock.
I think he's about to throw us out.,"Nope. His son is dead. The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them. It doesn't matter how much we piss him off as long as we find something. So go back there, piss him off and find something."
I understand that we're in a hurry but maybe he should.,Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.
He just got them a couple of weeks ago.,Because he was having headaches?
Because he was having headaches?,Answer the question before answering the door.
"Yeah, he was.",You're right. He was not doing cocaine. He had a brain tumor.
You're right. He was not doing cocaine. He had a brain tumor.,Don't bother. It's for me. Turns out they monitor these monitors.
"Thank you, Officer.",I thought the bracelet was decorative. My aunt had one just like it. Wait a minute.
You're allowed to be at the hospital. You're allowed to go home. That was made clear.,"Dead kid's House was on the way to my apartment. Assuming I got lost, twice."
Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks Every minute I keep them waiting. Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?,"I knew you were very busy, being vaguely important."
I might have cleared it with the cops.,"Yeah, it's the word ""might"" that bumps me, but I'll run it by you next time."
"Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board. I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you. For both our sakes.","Disciplinary hearing should be fun, and the subsequent lingering black mark on your record."
We have to wheel this out to the MRI. We should pRobably leave the body in the bag.,There's a mass in the arm. Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.
There's a mass in the arm. Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.,"So, where's the next job? You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets. The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one. The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro."
I had a video interview with Parkcago yesterday. It went well.,"My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma. Parkcago has a great program, and you're a dumbass."
"My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma. Parkcago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.","Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents. You're doing it to protect them. That's an insult to Everything teen prostitutes have worked for. Time to grow up and come clean."
We don't have any choice. The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys. They're shutting down.,This is so our song.
My Patient is running out of time.,Not worried. My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.
I want to be understanding. It's your first day backï¿½,See? I smell empathy.
See? I smell empathy.,You should remember all the good times. Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped n the ocean. What were you thinking?
"House, I haven't forgotten our friendship. For Every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.",Come in.
Paraneoplastic syndrome's out. The lung donor didn't have cancer.,Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.
That mass wasn't a tumor. It was coagulated plasma. E.R. pumped him full of it. I.V. leaked into his arm. I Even did a complete MRI. No cancer anywhere. We've got nothing.,Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs. They're reacting to something in the plasma.
But Every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors. We need to track down all of them.,"Still. It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right? My heart will go on."
No. You can't leave the hospital.,25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got. My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.
"I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to the case.",You asked me to ask you. Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?
"I don't trust you, House. I can't.",Actually you have to.
Not absolutely. Not outside the walls of this hospital.,"Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks."
Use the people already on the case.,"Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen."
We don't have the money to pay them.,"Oh, yeah. It went to interior designers, I understand."
You only have Park because she's on neurology's tab. You are making minimum wage.,I am?
"Get out of my office, please.",What do you got?
Number three went to a baseball game the day before he donated.,Boredom is not transmissible.
"He ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be. If our donor had an allergy, it could explain the lungs.",Nice.
What?,Nothing.
Don't start that.,Start what? I'm enjoying our conversation. The repartee.
There was no repartee.,That was repartee.
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it to help my Patient.,It's just good to hear your voice.
Goodbye.,That's my whiteboard. I need it. And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.
Dr. Foreman warned us that you'd try something. Told me to call him if you did. I'd like to do that.,I'll take this outside.
I'll take this outside.,Yeah.
Donor six traveled to Thailand around Khorat. Region was endemic with dengue fEver.,Good.
Good.,Yeah.
Alcohol.,He'd have to be pretty drunk for it to affect a pool of plasma.
"These guys have got that covered. Acute etoh ingestion could haveï¿½ hey, paint around them, they're not hurting anyone]",Who's painting?
"The crew's just starting. Paint fumes didn't cause contamination. But, maybe the old paint did. They scraped off the underpass, pRobably because it contains! lead.",Lead.
How's the chelation going?,REverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago. You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors. Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.
Thanks. Lead exposure's a nice diagnosis. I hope it pays off.,It will.
"I appreciate your confidence, but she's not reallyï¿½","Oh, no, she could die. But technically it will still pay off. Even if your Patient dies, someone will get the lungs."
We killed part of the lung.,Page Dr. Pinto stat to the cath lab.
We're going to the cath lab? Are you thinking that maybeï¿½,What? Who? One dead lobe means four alive ones. It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.
It makes sense. Unlike you stealing my phone.,"You have unlimited texting. Until your parents know, you will nEver see that punch for what it really was. Your February 4th. Sri Lankan Independence Day."
I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.,And I told you I wasn't listening. By my actions.
Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict. It was a moment of weakness.,"You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew. Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw. Maybe it's your character."
"You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew. Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw. Maybe it's your character.",Pinto!
House.,Embrace your inner bitch.
Embrace your inner bitch.,So why did chelation make the lungs worse?
So why did chelation make the lungs worse?,We got about five minutes till Pinto gets back. Give me a hand with this.
I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor. Negative for all our other exposures.,"Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment. I am a cripple, in need of assistance."
"Um, transplant team ran an A.C.E. Negative.",It's mine. And it's your job.
My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.,This chair will help me do that.
What if the scrapings from the bridge contained other heavy metals like barilium or asbestos?,Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.
Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.,But! maybe the pRoblem isn't a heavy metal from outside. It's inside. But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to. It's stuck. Iron. The donor had hemosiderosis.
His body wasn't disposing of iron. Massive amounts choke up the lungs. Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.,Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.
Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.,"I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair."
"I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.",Pinto.
"House, the nurses saw you come in.",Enter.
It's a bathroom.,"Ah, explains the hole in this chair."
"Ah, explains the hole in this chair.","God, I missed doors. And air freshener."
"God, I missed doors. And air freshener.",Now go away. I'm waiting for some test results.
My Patient signed a DNR. She's giving up. Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs. Making this yet another interaction with you in which I get nothing.,It's not my fault you can't handle your Patient.
"She said she's done. I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision. I accepted that. It's called respect.","And what's after respect? You find another angle. You hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear. You do whatEver it takes."
"Biopsy rEvealed, white blood cell inflitrates.","Infection was right, after all."
"Infection was right, after all.",Fresh fruit in prison is usually Parkcken.
Why aren't you more alarmed? We're running out of time.,"Aahh, she's dying! Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?"
Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.,"Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open. If they're hiding inside the lung cells! I'm thinking brucella. And to wipe that out, you need special ops. An intact immune system."
But that's what white blood cells are.,"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above."
"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.",Antibiotics and IVIG.
Did you use metaphors for your old team? Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?,"No, they were stupid too."
Hi.,Case is under control. It's me time.
Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry. You were right to push me. I needed that. Thank you.,So we're good?
"It was good advice. Just, came here to say thank you.","I like you. I have fun with you. And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that. But, just do whatEver you have to do to get over this. You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts. Either/or. Both seems excessive."
"The thing is, House! I don't like you.",When did the discoloration start?
A few minutes after I started the IVIG.,Means we're wrong about infection.
"And by we, you mean you. You screwed up the lungs.","Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues! Increase peep."
Already maxed out. We're close to the point of no return. The lungs will nEver be viable for transplant.,I need! I need ideas.
IgA nephropathy.,That's already ruled out.
Lupus.,No--o.
Maybe we're just out of time.,We're out of time when we're out of time. When they die or she dies. Keep them stable as long as you can. I need to think.
Make a wish. Make a wish.,The lungs are a smoker. You of all people should know better.
But the kid nEver smoked.,He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.
He played poker. Who plays poker without cigars? Even if he didn't light up himself! It was a rainy night. The windows were closed.,"All parents think their kids are special. And these ones were right. At least his white blood cells were special. They had an on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off. When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small pRoblems. No one Even noticed. Big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung. As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead Man. The motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish."
"Eosiniphilic pneumonitis. But, the steroids would have treated for that.","I was right. Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect. We need to hit it harder. We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg. We need the nuclear option."
"At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?","See, the metaphors work."
But that'll destroy the good lung too. Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.,Won't be fast enough. Wilson needs these lungs.
This is all you get. Ortho still has the outer office.,"Well, that sucks. Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?"
"You're welcome, House.",Oof!
Dinner later? I'll pick something up.,I heard about a good new vegetarian place.
Why am I watParkng you cut your hair?,"If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up."
I was referring less to where it's happening and more to why.,"New life, new look."
Does that mean you like your new life?,"If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding."
"It doesn't seem like much of a case. Although, I'm sure I'm wrong!",You are. Tell me why.
"Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast, so! that's really weird.","E.R. found nothing wrong, then I decided I should test his wallet."
He's rich? That's why we're taking the case?,"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich."
"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.",Dr. Adams. Give her the file.
This is my only copy.,"My M.O. depends upon the use of a team. Definitionally, that involves! more than one person. So I really have no choice. Give her the file."
You can't afford a team.,"Adams is free. And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag . New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa."
You said we were meeting for coffee.,"Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee. Wait! did you think I was referring to sex? Would you shut the blinds on your way out?"
I thought you were referring to talking.,"Talking about medicine. Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you."
"I'm not working, House. I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.","In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town ï¿½ ladling kittens, spaying soup!"
There is a free clinic in Trenton.,"Well, think of this as today's free clinic. Only with fewer bums with herpes."
I don't think we actually have much of a case. I think it's just dehydration.,What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?
I lost my job.,You saved a life.
Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier. Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.,That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.
"That's naive and sick. You really want to improve things? You do it through policy. This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?","That's right, all those babies with AIDS, they're just using us."
"My parents had $800 between them when they got here. They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off. No one gave me a handout. It makes me work harder.",Rebuttal.
What's your evil plan?,I object to your cynicism.
It's been earned.,"That's what I object to. The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks."
"My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.",What?
Your old team?,What?
"This is your new reality. You've got your office. You've got neighbors. You've got one employee, one volunteer. Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.",I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.
What about Thirteen?,Not a good choice. She's not long term because she has no long term.
Not taking your calls?,She will.
Discharge the Patient.,"Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhageï¿½"
"You've got two choices, House. You can recognize that your Patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom. In which case, you cannot take his money.",Send him home. And check with admitting for the net worth of all new Patients.
"I'm not coming back, House.","Technically, you're back right now."
"I need you to stop calling me. First 17 messages were cute, butï¿½",I'm putting the band back together.
"Interesting that you nEver showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer. I'm guessing ankle monitor.",Guilty as charged. Literally.
"I'm not a doctor anymore, House.","The job went away, but not the profession. You look healthy, so! that's not it. You met a boy. Or a girl. Fall in love, wanna be happy. You decided to! enjoy what time you have left. You're going to Thailand."
Turns out I like boring.,"No, you wanna like boring. But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored."
Please stop calling me.,No.
No.,You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me. That's a mixed signal. I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words. They're more honest.
Patient got tachycardic to 185. We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine. There's definitely something wrong with him.,"Which is awesome. Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for."
Thanks.,Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.
What about Whipple's?,"If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement."
You don't think defying huMan nature is neurological?,Racing heart: Medical condition. Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.
"Are you saying that because you beliEve it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?",I'm told that some people are just nice. I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks. Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.,"Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG. No, wait. I'll do the flushing. Take the damn $2.00. She hasn't Even sipped the coffee."
Benjamin's room--,"I just got so angry. You know? So I made a terrible mistake. Now I'm trying to start my life over. To help people the way I always wanted. But my department got defunded, and! it's my fault. Just can't stand to think of all those Patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work."
How about I help you out?,How do you mean?
"I'll give a million dollars as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.","Wow. I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me a million dollars. Which is step 17."
Is that bad?,Ethics are not my strong suit.
Wilson's office--,"Hypothetical ï¿½ if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline? Don't answer yet. Saying no will cause both of us pain. Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure."
"You can't take sex from a sexaholic. You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.",Could be wrong about the symptom. I'm wrong all the time.
Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.,"What is this, Canada? All we do is take money from sick people."
We work for it.,I'm working!
How much?,"20 dollars. Well, what if it was? It's the same principle. 20 dollars, a million! What's the difference?"
"Actually, the difference is pretty much a million dollars.","He came up with the figure, not me."
"Crap. Got a Patient with end stage renal disease. Her heart can't support dialysis. She needs a transplant, but! you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you, didn't you?",What?
I gotta go.,"It's all moot. Patient pRobably has long QT. PRobably just a really, really decent person. They exist, right?"
PPTH cafeteria--,"So! arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors. Plus, unfortunately, mental changes."
I still don't think it's neurological.,God bless you.
He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.,She's not drinking the coffee either.
Why?,"Yeah, why?"
You're not a stranger. And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiologicalï¿½,"Your parents didn't love you enough. So you need to prove your superiority. Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility. Or it's just rich guilt. I'm betting on the last one."
There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.,I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.
That comes with a rash. Echovirus.,"Virus, virus, virus, virus!"
"Fits his physical symptoms. And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes. Works for Everyone?","Start him on antivirals. And, Adams! when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give Bob CratParkt Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee."
"Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says ""previous entries."" You get a drop-down menu sorted by Patient name and department.",Thank you. Appreciate your help.
"You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?","No, not at all."
We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this. Aren't we?,"Yes, absolutely."
"Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.",Great. See you tomorrow morning.
"No, you won't.",Afternoon? I can't think of another interpretation.
"Shut up. Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to aParkEve. I'm nEver quite sure. But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it. I don't wanna come back to work for you. But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.","Everything has gone blue. That's not supposed to happen, right?"
Stay there. I'm comin'.,"No! you don't have to do that. Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a Szechuan beef."
That is six miles out of my way.,"Oh, okay, then. Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere."
Fine. I'll get the food.,You're a peach.
What's your Patient's status?,Better. We're discharging him.
Good.,"Hey, hey, hey. Why do you care? Specifically. Although I'm curious about a general answer too."
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my Patient with renal failure.,Did he meet your Patient with renal failure?
"No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.",I was wrong.
"Don't say that. House, she really needs this kidney.",He's not better. His mental status is declining.
Or he's doing an amazing thing for another huMan being.,I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.
"PPTH corridor, walking to Benjamin's room--",He's still sick.
His symptoms have gone away.,Not all of them. Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.
A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.,"Yeah, how Many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?"
"If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero. If it saves a life, who cares?","You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument. If there's Even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else."
More dangerous than complete renal failure? My Patient needs this. Now.,"Yeah. If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden."
I'll give you your money.,See? Crazy.
Perfectly logical.,People with mental deficiency can be logical. Just like sane people can be illogical.
"Dr. House, it's not a symptom. Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.","No, you won't."
"No, you won't.",We have time for one more test before we move him.
What test?,"WhatEver test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously."
"I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's. Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.",Bad idea. There's no joint pain. Where's Adams?
Why is she here?,'Cause I called her. Bigger question is why that worked.
I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and Iï¿½,We're too busy for rationalizations. Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life. He's pRobably not eating all that healthy.
Magnesium deficiency?,"Wait until they take him back to his room ï¿½ draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile."
"Joint pain is common, but not definitive. Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change. And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better. Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.",You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.
You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,Guilt. You feel guilty about leaving.
"Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me. You're nothing without me.",Not leaving me. Leaving huManity.
I'm going with my girlfriend. The Woman I love.,To have fun.
"You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here. And I think that's great. I'm proud to have been a part of it, but! now! I just wanna be happy.",Oh! no one's unhappy in Greece.
It just appeared in the last few weeks. He's having trouble holding a pencil in school.,"Does it itch? Do anything different lately? You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?"
"Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there. But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be Everywhere, wouldn't it?",It is in the water.
He's allergic to chlorine?,No! He's allergic to summer lilac.
That's my lotion. And it's not in the pool.,"No, it's on the palms of his hands. In the pool is the neighbor's daughter. Or the neighbor's hot wife. Here's some lube. Sorry. Too late for your eyesight."
Endoscopy didn't rEveal any lesions in the small intestine. I'm running PCR test now.,Found it in my office. Appears to be a gift. That can't be good.
Damn it.,You got her the job interview.
And that was supposed to be the end of it. I! don't take charity.,Good for you! You loon.
I don't like owing people things.,"So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you. Or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing. I'm betting on the last one."
I just don't like it. It makes me feel! icky.,That's the reason? Ickiness? You nEver Even tried to analyze this? It's Even crazier than the gift thing.
House! there's no sign of tropheryma DNA. It's not Whipple's.,Well! we did what we could.
Almost always hits the kidneys.,"Ah, Dr. Foreman. Perhaps you can help us. I can't decide whether to take out an ""I told you so"" ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car."
You're off the case.,That seems like an overreaction.
That's idiotic. Sorry.,"Don't apologize. I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right. Two lives are in the balance here."
"House, I worked for you for sEven years. I know how you operate. So when I see symptoms magically show up right when you need themï¿½","And I was your boss for sEven years. And I know what a suspicious, microManaging hard-ass you are. Why would I do this now? Knowing you can send me right back to jail?"
What'd you give him?,Nothing! You can't prove otherwise. So why don't you do the smart thing here?
You can't let him do this.,He's the boss. And he's right.
I assume you dosed the Patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?,I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job? What's with you and Park?
Nothing.,"I expect my people to lie better than that. Either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her. In which case, I will be teaParkng you my secret homey handshake."
I just! I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee. I wanted to see how deep it went.,But now?
"Oh, now I just want to win.",What was in the box?
Gift certifiCate. The Spa.,"Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciproCate. You gotta push her neuroses to the point where Even she thinks that she's crazy."
"Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciproCate. You gotta push her neuroses to the point where Even she thinks that she's crazy.","One more favor. Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forEver. Or I'm lying. Either way, it's more interesting than whatEver you're doing now."
"Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes. If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.","You know, the ""down"" vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy. And that haircut isn't helping, either."
Could be Coxsackie B virus.,Or pericarditis.
"And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.",It's unlikely! but it's possible. What else? I said what else?
It's unlikely! but it's possible. What else? I said what else?,"Oh, for!"
"Oh, for!","There. That's better. Now, what else? Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to pRobable."
"No, I'll go.","So what's the answer? Are you now on the team? Like, forEver?"
I don't know.,'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.
'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.,So! guilt?
"Yes, you were right. You're always right. I just! I have the skills to help people. Is it okay for me to walk away from that because I! want to just have fun?",Obviously not.
Wilson's office-- House opens the door.,How's your Patient?
"No department. No money. And somehow, you Managed to con her into hanging around.",I have a gift.
What?,It was a con.
The Patient was faking?,"No, I was. I brought him in here under false pretenses. Just to get his money. I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here. One of them was a head CT, which uses! iodine contrast."
You think he's allergic to Iodine?,"No, again. Just don't interrupt me. Thirteen was right. This is a thyroid issue. He has Plummer's disease. He has a nodule in his thyroid. It produces excess hormone. Not enough to test abnormal, just more than his brain is used to. Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating."
Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.,"I said don't interrupt. But, yes, you're right. Take out the nodule, he'll be fine."
"Benjamin's room-- Benjamin is in his bed, with a gauze in his neck. House is sitting beside him, reading a 'Guitar' magazine. Benjamin wakes up.","Two days, one surgery. I now accept that you're all better. Where's my money?"
You made me sick.,"You were already sick. I just made you much, much worse. Seriously! the money. You're not giving it to me, are you?"
When you're facing death! some things come into focus. My wife!,You love your family. You want them back. Your altruism was always a symptom.
"No, it wasn't. I'm still gonnaï¿½",Keep less? How much less? Just enough to spoil your kids?
No.,But they need it more than people with TB or Parkldren in Indonesia with no eyes? Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?
I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.,I was an ass last week.
I love my family. I want to be with them. That doesn't make me a bad person.,No. It makes you a healthy person.
Your car is getting fixed. You're right. She went for it.,Good work. Need a lift tomorrow? 'Cause your car is still in the shop.
I don't take charity. I'm just glad it's over.,Nothing is Ever over.
"PPTH lobby-- Thirteen meets her girlfriend in the lobby, and kisses her. Just when they are about to leave, House calls her.",Thirteen. Wait a minute. You're fired.
"Now what? House, I'm starving.",I'm not joking. You're fired. Don't come in tomorrow.
House!,I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go. People who got something to prove. People who just get off on weird cases. What I can't work with is someone who's here so she doesn't have to feel bad.
You're trying to save me.,Yes! I think that little of you and that much of me.
I need you to drive me to a doctor.,This would totally suck.
"Central serous retinopathy. It's linked to type ""A"" personalities.","Funduscopic exam was normal. If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff. From your ex-boss. Thank you. ""Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee. Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training. And on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, I sincerely apologize."" You are so fired."
What? He apologized.,"What? Because he said he apologized? He's saying he's sorry that someone, namely you, overreacted ï¿½ namely, by punParkng him."
He grabbed my behind.,Word is it was a celebratory slap after you completed your first-Ever AVM embolization.
"He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it, and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.","The classes make him sympathetic. Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker! Evil. Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired."
100 bucks says I won't get fired.,"Oh, you don't wanna bet me."
"Oh, you don't wanna bet me.","Oh, my."
"Oh, my.",You're fired.
I! The bet isï¿½,But I thoughtï¿½
After! Then I! Ohï¿½,If onlyï¿½
The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing!,"I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole."
"I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.",You're late.
"Considering I don't work here, arguably, I'm early.",Pearl earrings? Knee-length dress. That's not a very shameful walk of shame.
I was at a job interview.,I hope it went terribly.
Thad Barton? We only help rich white guys?,I am an equal opportunity exploiter. I only help those who can help myself. I have a department to re-fund.
"Atropine poisoning. He's moving his company to Parkna, and his employees are hanging him in effigy. Could have moved on to the real thing.",Pupils are normal.
Thyrotoxicosis?,Not! a terrible idea. I'm gonna go give him P.T.U. and T.L.C. I have no idea what that second one stands for.
"Things don't seem small anymore, theyï¿½ I woke up from a nap and, uh, Everything went from really small to really huge.","Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore. The change actually makes things simpler. Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine."
Seriously?,"I nEver joke. Good news is, it's treatable with medication. Bad news is! it can make you very, very late for very important dates. I sometimes joke."
trying to find money in our budget so we don't have to move our operations overseas.,"I get it. Answer's no. Shouldn't have said anything. I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for Parkna. 'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering! How they look down on mental illness."
What are you guys talking about?,"Oh, just how different the two cultures are. For example, our opinions on mental illness. Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition. There, it's taboo enough to destroy a high profile business deal."
Let's try the medication first. How much do you want?,"You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub. Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one."
You got the money? How?,Patient's a smart businessMan.
He's destroying thousands of jobs.,"Jobs are not being destroyed. They're being reloCated. The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot. To put it another way, a patriot."
Patriotism is natural. We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe. It's helpful for society if its members have positive feelings about that society.,"Iranian women. Drag Queens in Uganda. Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures. But each time, it's just the best. I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain."
I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome. Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?,He's nEver gonna know. He's actually in here right now.
Blood count and protein count are normal.,"I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome. Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black."
If it makes Andrews look sympathetic!,Copying him makes you look pathetic. And I will pay you not to go to anger Management classes.
What about another clotting pRoblem? Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.,It's possible. Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.
Myelodysplastic syndrome.,I heard about your conversation with the Patient's daughter. You were hostile.
"Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.",Yet you were nEver anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison. Those guys made decisions you supported?
Myelodysplastic syndrome.,I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.
I was at a job interview.,You got to work at 9:15. Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away. It's not possible. My condolences.
I wasn't at a funeral.,That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.
That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.,Who goes there? REveal yourself!
Now.,"Well, we would. But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night."
What are you doing?,Holding your ass. You really didn't know?
House!,"Just trying to help you out here. I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face, thus proving it's a natural response. My God, you have super-huMan discipline. And glutes."
Why! did you do that?,We have a bet.
But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee. Forget about the bet.,You two really need to do your homework with me. Treat the Patient with activated protein c.
"And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.","Exactly. It's a conclusive test. There's no actual risk. As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here."
Is this supposed to itch like this?,ItParkng. Interesting.
Not interesting. Already went away.,Doubly interesting. Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.
Turn that off.,Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system. That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.
Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system. That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.,Oh ho ho! Cool.
"Oh, you will. And! I'll deny it, and he'll beliEve you. But then these two beliEve that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home. So they'll nEver testify against me. And you won't be able to prove anything.","Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove."
I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.,"This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid."
"First patriotism, now loyalty. You hate ice cream too?","French vanilla, yeah. To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression."
I had a thought. Other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships. The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. What if she was misdiagnosed?,Dutch chocolate's not bad. Gotta give 'em that.
"Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus, HTLV-1, which our Patient contracted through having sex with his wife.","In other words, loyalty gave him cancer. I like it. Start him on radiation."
Chang and Eng Bunker. It's the most famous conjoined twins in history. 2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.,The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation. What took you so long? I already lost one of them.
You need help with the lacerations?,"No, I think I got palliative. Why don't you take prEventative?"
PrEvent what? He got in a fight.,Which he started. Which means he's both irascible and stupid.
"I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is ""conjoined twin,"" not ""Siamese.""","I can't comment on the drunk or the frat. But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam. And they were, in fact, twins. If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick. But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger Management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time."
"Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it. But when you think about the consequencesï¿½","Okay, let's go."
I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.,"No, I got Everything I need."
Sometimes!,Sometimes! It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it. Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.
EKG and troponins were equivocal. It's not Even clear if our Patient just had a heart attack or what it was.,"Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities. Get him an echo to confirm. I need $200,000. His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted."
And you want to do some insider trading? I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?,"It's not insider trading. Just betting on myself to solve the case. Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back."
No.,"No, you don't say ""no."" You! make a counter offer."
I'm not loaning my boss money.,"Fine. I'll make you a counter. $100,000. $20,000. I'll buy options instead of shares. More risk, but more upside. But that's as low as I'm gonna go."
"I could do $5,000.",Really? No backsies.
If! you double your clinic hours. Six a week. I've seen how you disrespect those Patients.,So you want twice as Many of them disrespected?
"Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more huManely.","And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea."
Deal?,"Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old Patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. And deal!"
"Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old Patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. And deal!","Of course, you know! this means war."
"If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical. EP study.","Nice idea. Even has a metaphor in it. Not worth more than my honor. But delightful, all the same."
I'm not going to lose. My college roommate is the editor of the Yale Law Review. She's writing my opening statement.,"You will be eloquent in your loss. This case boils down to he said, she said. He said, ""I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes."" She said, ""I've been a fellow for two months, and I'm kind of weird."""
I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.,"Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA. That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking. Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion. Forget that. Wild speculation. Go do the EP study."
Then why isn't he saturated?,"Seems healthy to me. Let's release him. My option to sell Barton Foods at $34 is about to expire. So they thought the Patient would be better by now. Instead, I am going to lose $20,000."
20?,"Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson. Plus the ten I got on margin. You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney. Unless! There is a way that you can get your money back. Give me the full $200,000."
"And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.","It's your own fault. You forced me to go with the options here. Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances. Regular stock this time, nice and safe."
I'm not angry. I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.,You refuse to bet on yourself. That means low self-esteem.
"So if I give you $200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.",Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger! Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.
Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger! Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.,"Ah, ah, ah, ah! No spoilers. They ruin Everything."
Pulmonology was that way.,Our Patient's lung pRoblem is not a lung pRoblem. It's a brain pRoblem. We're consulting with Neurology.
That's my old boss. You don't actually think this is neurological.,"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness."
"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.",Dr. Andrews. My associates. Doctors Adams and Park.
Can we go now?,You really wanna turn your back on this guy? Sorry. Carry on.
Uh! well! It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement. Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once. Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice!"
Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.,"Do you really beliEve in this diagnosis? Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a sEvere anatomical disadvantage."
It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.,No! it's normal pressure hydrocephalus. Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.
She's not yours to fire.,"You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my Patient is now in a coma."
"Seriously, House?","At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know. She went out of her way to defy me! She needsï¿½ Damn it, you should just fire her!"
I can't beliEve you did that.,Right back at ya. Our Patient's dying. We need theories.
It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus. Andrews predicted the coma.,"Yeah, but Even a broken doctor's right twice a day. Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky. Coma had to be a lucky guess."
"If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?",I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.
You have a wonderful way of communicating.,"I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table. She listens to me, I waste an hour. If she defies me! Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks. Up high."
"I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table. She listens to me, I waste an hour. If she defies me! Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks. Up high.",You're angry.
Yes! Now I'm angry. Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.,No. What else would explain our symptoms and make our Patient go into a coma during that test? How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?
"No, we already tested his liver enzymes. They're normal.",Or his liver's so far gone it can't Even produce enzymes.
"Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver. I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong. His ICP was not normal. It was elevated. What about HTLV?",We ruled that out three days ago.
"Because of his heart pRoblems, butï¿½","Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on."
"You owe me 106,804 Yuan. Or $100 U.S.","God, but you're petty. Okay, so! two options. Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey."
Brain scans indiCate it could be Loa loa disease.,"Ah, shut it off!"
"Ah, shut it off!",Apparently we're allowed to do this now.
"Get out of here, House!","This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter ""Y."""
I'm thirsty.,"That's a side effect of not dying. Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy. Complexes of large, y-shaped antibodies were clogging up your blood vessels, causing your organs to shut down one by one. Now, usually with hyperviscosity syndrome, it's caused by an elevated blood count or protein count. Yours eluded us 'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis. Now that they're being filtered out, the blood would be! a little less duck sauce and a little more soy sauce."
So I'm gonna be completely cured.,"It's not all about you. Your stock price will be completely cured. Once you sign this. It's a press release. It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to Parkna."
"He just woke up. Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.","Ah, mm, yeah, actually! he does. 'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.m. And this means a lot to me. You may remember me from the time I saved your life."
"Dad! I can't do it. If this is really about family, you will not do this.",Morning.
Morning.,Got lucky this time.
"No, you didn't. I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral. You went out of your way to help her. She obviously earned your respect, passed whatEver test youï¿½","I sabotaged her hearing. You do read the school paper, don't you?"
"If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist. What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.",'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.
"You know that Everyone on that panel hates you. You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.","That's just hurtful. The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her. Here's your five grand."
What five grand?,Just take it. Trust me.
Just take it. Trust me.,Found her sleeping in the Park. Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her. And that is exactly what happened! as far as you can prove.
Congratulations. You're not going to jail! today. But you do know I just can't let this slide. You need to keep up your rep.,Fine. Clinic hours. I'll double them.
Okay. 12 hours a week.,No! Three times two equals six.
And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12. I know about your deal with Adams.,Call Chase and Taub. Get 'em in here. The boys are back.
This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.,I know.
You paged me?,Congratulations.
Congratulations.,"You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning. You had a big fight. That's why you were late. You re-pitched an S.T.D. You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word ""loyalty,"" which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty! after having been rejected explains the clothes."
It wasn't my boyfriend. It was my husband. I was at my Lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.,Wow. I missed the fact that you were married.
We've been separated for almost a year.,So! old news? No anger left? It's all bought and paid for.
Male Patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease,What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?
He said he was at work.,You're late.
"According to my calendar, I'm a week early.","Beard's a nice touch. Lets Everyone know that you're not a teenage girl. Oh, now, you two make a cute couple. And you two! It's not important."
And I look forward to working with you as well.,"He's lying, not just Taub! the Patient. These abrasions on his knees! they're minty fresh! about ten hours old."
He got them playing flag football.,"He said he got them playing flag football. I'm sure that's true if ""flag"" is a euphemism for ""penis"" and ""football"" is a euphemism for ""entering a vagina."""
Everybody lies.,"Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?"
"Wow, twins! congratulations.",Awkward! He knocked up two different women at the same time! At least he thinks he did. You have them DNA tested yet?
Why would I? They look just like me.,But they will grow. Find out what else he's lying about. Do an exercise test! see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.
But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.,Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.
He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.,"The prodigal son has returned. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch."
It's his heart we're worried about. The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check for any abnormalities.,I spent a month in solitary. You don't think I can keep this up all day?
I have a headache. Could you just lower your voice?,Chase and Taub are back!
You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?,I also think that Taub has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.
Why would he do that?,"Because I didn't give him time to do anything else. Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?"
They're not here.,"What? I just came for a chat with a friend. What's that I smell, friend?"
"I understand your confusion. I was eating a baby for lunch, and! I have a massive migraine. Will you please just go away?",You should pRobably lie down and rest.
Yeah. I was trying to.,Oh! There is one more thing.
It's extreme and reckless. That's House. You get used to it.,Or I fire you. Look what I found! Kiddie-winkies! I wonder who they belong to.
Give me my kids.,No. I genuinely wonder who they belong to. I need a DNA sample.
I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.,"Already did. This swab's for you. Fine. If you don't mind paying a fortune in Parkld support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek."
Myocarditis! viral infection weakening the wall muscles. We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.,Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.
Could be genetic! Brugada Syndrome.,"Oh, my God. Two prodigal sons. Come on. Let's hug it out."
"You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?","It's a stupid idea. We would have seen evidence of Brugada in the E.K.G. You know, this is! this is just messing with my feng shui here. What about over there?"
A pheochromocytoma. Excess adrenaline can cause heart pRoblems and! seizures.,Boring!
"I'm sorry. I thought I was here to treat the Patients, not entertain you.","Would it hurt to do both? Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring. I didn't say it was wrong."
So I'm right.,"Nope. You're wrong. Photic epilepsy! it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right. Give him an E.E.G. to confirm."
What exactly are they building back there?,A dream.
He doesn't have photic epilepsy.,"I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma."
You said I was wrong.,"You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first. That only takes a couple of hours. Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night. Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urine test and blood draws Every two hours."
"I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes!",Chase and Adams can do the test.
Thank you.,For the massage bed. You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.
Where is the construction crew?,"Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night. So I chose night."
"It's not meningitis. His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.","He's only guessing. I'm talking to Taub. He can't say ""my kids"" until he lets me test them. Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride."
"Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both huMan and animal.",PRobably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.
The bathroom also tested positive for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.,Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.
Yeah. How'd you know?,"The bulge in his neck. The bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus! Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him."
"The bulge in his neck. The bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus! Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.",You have at least a trillion cells. You're gonna misplace one of them Eventually.
"We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal. It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.",But not his swollen lymph nodes.
Why are we stealing cable from here? We don't Even have a TV in our office.,"I'm an ex-con, trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by. Stealing's all I know! that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our Patient. Just wrong about what?"
"Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.",That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.,"And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score. It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect."
Some people think it's burning now. Maybe if Everybody didn't lie!,"Aw, that is cute. I'm talking about your breasts. They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest. Truth. It's uncomfortable, isn't it? More truth! I only noticed because Chase was staring at them. He'd nEver admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you. Same reason he'd nEver tell you that he's thought about having sex with you. Although, to be fair, Every Man you've Ever met has thought about having sex with you. They'll lie, because if you knew! you pRobably wouldn't want to have sex with them. And that's just some of the lies from the last minute. And here's a bigger one! you already know this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized. Most people find it easier to ignore the truth. Ask Taub. Our Patient can't wait for a transplant that's nEver gonna come. We need to get reckless and extreme. C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out. Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics."
Liver function has improved 30%! buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.,"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?"
"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?",And scene. Now we're back to boring reality reality. His liver was in shock before. He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.
We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.,Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.
He's allergic to a person?,"Or something she's wearing! makeup, perfume, birth control method, her ""Hello Kitty"" doll. Two of you go find her and find out what. Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test."
Is Everyone trying to think of an answer? Or is Everyone afraid to say,I take it you're in the latter Category.
There's no treatment for it.,It fits. Case closed. Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
I nEver heard of a neurological pRoblem that causes someone's skin to fall off.,"Because there isn't one. The aneurysm is just another symptom. It's not the cause. You add them all together, we get! We get Kaw! Kawas! Kawas! It's Kawasaki's Disease. It's autoimmune."
"Yes, we knew what ""kawah"" meant. We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian Parkldren!","Which you might have, by the way. Which is basically why we missed it. Rug burns! certain carpet-cleaning chemicals have been linked to it. Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Monitor the aneurysm. If it doesn't resolve itself we'll have to repair it. The rest of you! aren't surfing enough."
Monkey DNA! nice touch.,Really? You don't think I should have gone with rat? I've been second-guessing myself all day.
Where are the DNA results?,First admit that I was right.
You Manipulated me into doing it.,"Yeah, I'll admit to that. Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest Man."
I love them. I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.,What about both? Could be. Haven't read these. Now say I was right.
"No. I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this. I don't care.","You do, and I'll prove it. I will shred this. I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it. Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all."
A hot tub would be cool.,"New team, old team! I present! Phase one of Operation Outer Office 2.0."
Nothing's changed.,"Oh, Everything has changed."
Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal. Clotting parameters are normal.,You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt. Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.
It's pRobably from my seat belt.,Wrinkle pattern's too varied. It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.
"PRobably from the diaper bag. If the Patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.","The tox screen was clean. I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with. If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago."
The Patient was punched in the groin. Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.,"Carotid duplex is normal. Who's better qualified to be the daddy? The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like, not shtupping mommy after the divorce?"
Thank you?,"Makes sense. Park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable, she has to measure their affection in hours. Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom were so indifferent, he has to beliEve it's a wash. Your turn. What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?"
They were good parents.,"That's an oxymoron. Chase is right. All parents screw up all Parkldren. He's also dreAmy, but it's not relevant now."
"So all parents screw up all Parkldren, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move? Endocarditis. Flipped a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.","Transesophageal echo to confirm. Screwed up is your best case. Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared."
I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.,There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.
"I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.","Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes. Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue."
I need Insulin. I know it.,"Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole."
That bloodwork is week's old. Test me again.,I am the test. The test is negative. The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass. That last insult was your cue to leave.
Test me.,Fine. Wait right here.
Thank you.,Sleep study. Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.
We need to talk about Saturday night.,"No, no, no, no, no. Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us. The legendary night, on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.00."
"I have a chance to really watch it. A Patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under House and office arrest. I just wanted to make sure you were cool if I go to Atlantic City without you.","Uh, no, thanks. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you."
These are ringside seats.,"Cameras are ringside too. If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time."
I'd take you if I could.,"Well, I'd take me if either of us could. See what a tough spot I'm in?"
I'm going to that fight.,"All right, I'll take the other ticket. Let me worry about logistics."
"Patient's heart valves are normal. It's not endocarditis. But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.",He has a heart pRoblem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.
"Syph test was negative. Plus, the kid's nEver been sexually active.","Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says ""birthday clown."""
Histoplasmosis?,He's not immuno-compromised. And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.
I mentioned it because!,Take your time. We'll continue with the medicine.
Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis and cerebral arteritis.,Sjogren's it is. IV immunosuppressants to treat. Anything?
What are you doing with her?,"""Her""? Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name."
I wasn't in a strong negotiating position. Why is she here?,Ruby dropped her off. Seemed pretty upset. Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night. She wasn't Even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.
Patient has low platelets. Makes me think D.I.C.,She doesn't seem to like that idea. You're right. He has no sParkstocytes in his smear.
No Grey-Turner's sign.,"She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her. Maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her. Could it be, she doesn't know the difference?"
So Many Parkldren of your own. No wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.,"Good point. How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby."
Low white count suggests infection.,What if you're all right? Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals!
Aplastic anemia.,"Kid needs a bone marrow transplant. Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match."
"Kid needs a bone marrow transplant. Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.",You started college a semester late because you left high school a semester late because you had five incompletes in your junior year.
And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?,Did okay before that. Straight As after that.
I went through a rebellious phase.,Don't tell me. Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.
I'm in a meeting.,"Sorry. Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting."
"Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.",That's cool. I'll wait.
"Just got this. The American Association of Rheumatology wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City. Dr. Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.",I hate conferences.
"This is a big one, and it's the premium slot. I'd like you to do it. I'll clear it with your parole Officer. What do I need to do for you?",Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved. I think you refer to it as petty cash.
Fine. Just one thing. I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning. We're doing them a favor. Why should you have to spend the night?,"You said that 9:00 was the premium slot. I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers."
"The place will be a madHouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight at the exact same time. Nice try. You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement. You go to that fight, you go to prison.","But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here."
Test my urine.,Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.
Yeah. I have diabetes.,"No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one. So whose urine is that? Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?"
It's not a scam. I'm sick. Now I have swollen ankles.,The medical term is cankles. Is there some black market in insulin that I don't know about?
"It's in my genes. My old Man got diabetes at 50. My older brother, got it at 50. I just turned 50.","Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch."
"No one in mom's family's a match, and as far as she knows, dad has no living relatives. It's been years since he died.","If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom nEver took him to a dermatologist?"
Are you gonna test my urine or what?,Not diabetes. Use cross-matched platelets. Try to find the Patient some blood that's closer to his own. And get the real story on clown senior's death. Mom's hiding something. It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.
Not diabetes. Use cross-matched platelets. Try to find the Patient some blood that's closer to his own. And get the real story on clown senior's death. Mom's hiding something. It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.,Apple juice. Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.
You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?,Nope. No realization whatsoEver.
You have a LoJack on your leg.,I was happy watParkng the fight on pay-per-view. You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.
"Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister. The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk. I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.",You're trying to deflect.
Now you are. You have to beliEve that Every parent screws up Every Parkld or you were screwed out of a decent Parkldhood.,My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom. He pRobably would have taken other kids to the playground.
My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom. He pRobably would have taken other kids to the playground.,It's not my fault. Bad parenting.
"It started with card games. High-stakes poker. Then my dad got into narcotics, at first just selling but then, using too, or he nEver would have gotten into the slave trade. Parkldren mostly. Easier to pack in small crates. Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.",Won't Even trust a co-worker. What did your parents do to you?
It means you don't have to make that drive. The pRoblem isn't his marrow. It's his liver.,"Liver failure. Explains Everything. The question is, what explains the liver failure?"
"It's not an infection. We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.","More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?"
Why are you looking at her?,"'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something. Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena. Almost anything works after ""boxing,"" except the word ""game."""
Huh huh.,Can you beliEve she used to work in the can? Nothing is tamper-proof.
"It's a synthetic pRoblem. His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels. And mom's a selfish jerk. She traded up, married a Lawyer, wants to forget the lowly circus clown.",You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens. You want to beliEve the mythical biological connection excuses being a Man slut. Ow! I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise. You do have a classified ad and a piece of metal.
She Robbed them of 12 years together.,"Or she ripped off the band-aid too late. That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him Chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland. And I mean that metaphorically, of course."
"Or she ripped off the band-aid too late. That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him Chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland. And I mean that metaphorically, of course.",This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.
This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.,I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.
"Can't treat for both. One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't Even get the kid a marrow match.","Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein. If it's a synthetic pRoblem, more fluid will leak into his chest and his heart will fail. If it's hyperammonemic, toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma."
Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?,"There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?"
In here.,"Oh, my God. The water. This is completely my fault."
Dr. House?,Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts. I'm busy.
My husband saw you in the clinic. Wants treatment for diabetes.,My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.
"He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.","Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him!"
Could you write me a fake prescription for Insulin?,"The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one."
Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh. His symptoms will go away and then I can show him he was nEver sick. Water?,Imaginary medicine is not my specialty. I do have an imaginary colleague who's just sent me an imaginary page. Imagine how sorry I am.
Lucky girl. Gets another sleepover with da-da. It makes a difference. Doesn't it?,Didn't answer your page last night.
"We got the Patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver pRoblem.","And mom's determination to keep dad away, Even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide."
It's not diagnostically relevant. Let's let it drop.,You just lost my vote. You flip-flopped on parental rights.
"I've been trying to persuade the mother, but it's her son, so it's her call.","Well, that very evolved of you. Don't usually see Darwinian changes over breakfast. You made nice-nice with Phil. You decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all."
Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.,"Hey, we're having a conversation here. No abdominal pain. So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof."
Swelling would have followed gravity.,Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards? Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice to maximize their niceness?
And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?,"Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you."
Swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes. Burkitt's lymphoma.,Swelling. Cankles.
That's not a symptom of Burkitt's. Are you saying it's!,It's Burkitt's. Prep him for chemo.
Great. It's cute.,Cankles.
I'm faint. I've been gaining more weight. I think I need a bigger dose.,"If you double his placebo, he might drown. Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow."
My! my heart rate is not! 52?,"The technical term is slow. Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?"
A pound of it. Every day.,"Bok choy has glucosinolates, which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms."
So this isn't diabetes?,You have a bad case of irony. The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.
"Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.","On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes Even without 'em."
"Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.","No rush. ICU stands for take your time, in Latin."
Multiple aneurysms?,That would mean that Every symptom after his T.I.A. was a coincidence.
Cholesterol emboli?,"Bingo. Fits perfectly. Check the file, confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it."
No! Get out of here!,"Wait. You sexually molested your son. Your walk, tabes dorsalis. You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our Patient, presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions."
We tested him for syphilis. He was negative.,"After 12 years, the active infection would have died down. Everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests. But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dorMant bacteria in his pelvis. The immunosuppressant's we gave him sent it into overdrive. The antibiotics we gave him actually started destroying the syphilis. But like pouring water on a fire, that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash, which made his immune system overcompensate. SEvere Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction."
Is this true?,"Yes, Jarisch-Herxheimer is real. It sounds silly, but! Oh, you mean the! the! right."
"I found stains on his clothes. He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized. I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten, and he seemed! and he seemed happy and he seemed normal.",So you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.
"I was just trying to protect him, like I should have done from the start. Sorry.","IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies, he'll be fine. Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing."
We're not done.,"No, we are not. Notify the dad's sexual partners. Notify his employer, his landlord. Notify the police."
I meant the kid. We're not gonna tell him he was molested?,To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?
To tell him the truth. He's a virgin. How do we explain the STD? It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the parents. The kid's our Patient.,I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.
Why is it my choice?,'Cause you're a dad. How could the rest of us possibly understand?
I didn't tell him.,Your heart said he needed to know. Your brain knew he's better off without it. Following your heart is easy. Following your brain is tough. Especially after years of following that much smaller third organ. That's why all parents screw up all Parkldren.
Your heart said he needed to know. Your brain knew he's better off without it. Following your heart is easy. Following your brain is tough. Especially after years of following that much smaller third organ. That's why all parents screw up all Parkldren.,Evening.
"ClEver tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.","How could that possibly work as a tactic? The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up. The details are just gravy."
You're wrong. The only evidence you have is proof of something else. I ran away from home.,Because you had lousy parents.
Because I didn't. All my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs or barely knew their kids' birthdays.,You envied their dysfunction.
"It was stupid. I hitchhiked to Manhattan, moved in with an older guy. In two months, I came running home. It took my parents years to get over it.",That's when you started to excel. You were making it up to them. Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.
How does briefly wishing I was screwed up make me screwed up?,It's normal to be screwed up. It's really screwed up to roManticize it. I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.
It's why I wanted to work with you.,It was a tactic.
He comes in with straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut Rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.,"""Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather."" I'm thinking of going hang gliding."
"Pax river is, like, completely flat. I think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there. I like naval stuff.","I like their oranges and lint. What looks like kidney disease, but isn't? And where's Chase?"
Got a case for you.,Smells funny.
Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction. It stumped two E.R. docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.,Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year. Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.
"14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.","Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door."
This Patient died five years ago.,I didn't say which side of the door he was on. The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting. Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.
I thought it was relevant.,"Death is a consequence, not a symptom. If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant."
"Shouldn't we be trying to maximize what we can save here? 14-year-old, your freedom, our asses?",Right! save your asses.
"Anti-anxiety medications would explain it. If we keep her off, she'll be moody, but healthy. Or it's something else.",I need to DDX a Patient with you.
I thought you had a team for that.,"According to Foreman, they're only for DDXing people who are still alive."
You have a dead Patient?,"Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers. I don't see creed, color, pulse."
"Foreman will find out you're taking this case and he'll bust you. But you know that, which means! you want to go back to jail! because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.","Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting. Four-year-old kid. His kidneys died, they transfused. His lungs died. He died."
Have you seen Bride of the Monster? I just got the Ed Wood box set.,What if the Parkcken was the egg? What if the lung involvement came first?
I don't really care about the movie. I just don't want to indulge your!,Lupus.
"Because this is a bad idea, House.",If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue! Damn! I just realized I'm late for my anger Management class.
Spoiled grandParkldren.,Platitudes.
Any others?,"And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead Parkld. Am I right, Emory?"
I don't think Emory wants to share right now.,"They blew it, didn't they? They missed your son's rash. A faint one, on his cheek."
He didn't have a rash. I think we should talk about Lena's grandParkldren.,They're alive. Was he sensitive to sunlight?
Greg!,Cold fingers and toes?
No!,Wegener's granulomatosis. I need to examine your son.
You're a bit late for that! you ass.,"With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order. Find out what killed him."
"Ex-wife. And you'll nEver get her consent. She's moved on! new hub, new kid. She wants nothing to do with Drew's death. Or me.","You're angry because your kid died. More than that, because you don't have an answer. People need answers."
My! my arms. I can't feel my arms.,"At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself."
"Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.",More like 13 minutes.
"Before we proceed any further, doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.",Have you Ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?
"I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.","So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect. I think they got the cause of death wrong. And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right."
I prepared the sarcophagus for you.,"Thank you, Igor."
It's Milton.,You owe me a new pair of pants.
She is pregnant. Test came back positive.,So! she lost the use of her arms and her innocence. A vengeful God? Or!
MS.,I gather from the silence that Chase isn't there.
"Nope, I'm here. Where are you?","""Nowhere""! he said cryptically. I assume you concur with the diagnosis."
Absolutely.,Even though there are three diagnoses? And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.
I met a Woman who likes her men well groomed.,"All over? I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian."
Ouch.,Question is! is this really about a Woman? Or is it about something more profound?
"Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an STD? HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.","I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow. In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors. And check Chase for testosterone."
"A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy could explain bleeding pRoblems, and pregnancy could exacerbate it.","Boys, do a home search. Girls, do lab tests. I'm pretty sure that's not sexist."
Where have you been?,"Picking up dry cleaning. Filling up the tank. Violating the dead. If you don't beliEve me, call the monitoring company."
"I did. Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact same 45 minutes you weren't here.","Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding."
"I admire the creativity. But what happens when the stunt doesn't work? Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet? Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours? I'm gonna call your P.O., and you're gonna go back to jail.","There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning."
"You're an addict. And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.",Sorry. Vicodin repeating on me.
"You're also addicted to puzzles. You show all the classic behaviors. Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.",Working on a medical case is not a parole violation. It's my job description.
Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.,NEver mind Bride of the Monster. You need to watch Norma Rae.
NEver mind Bride of the Monster. You need to watch Norma Rae.,"Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to reloCate.

Hi. I'm here for the free flu shot. I got a call saying!,I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid. Losing a Parkld! just breezed right through it.
How do you know about my first kid!,Didn't Even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.
Where are you getting this?,You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.
You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.,Damn it.
You had no right to say that.,I know. I deserved the slap. But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it. Apathetic hyperthyroidism. Could have kidney involvement. Could be genetic. Definitely causes apathy. I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.
You know Emory.,We belong to the same club.
He wants to relive this. I don't.,So I heard.
"Emory was a wonderful Man. NEver afraid to show his emotions. Which is great, most of the time. But when Drew died! it overwhelmed him. I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.",So that's why you left him?
I left because of his eyes. He had Drew's eyes.,Who used to babysit Drew?
"My father, but!",His place or yours?
"There are two types of people. Those who can move on, and those who can't. My father keeps up a good front, but he's just like Emory. You need to leave him alone.",So he has two types of people inside of him.

Foreman's not gonna back down.,He's not an idiot.

What did he eat?
We watched lot of TV. And ate biscuits.,Did you give him sidewalk chalk?
No.,Finger paints?
No!,A sandbox?

"I told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch!",Temper trigger.
I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.,Which idiot did the pregnancy test?
"I did one of them. Chase did another. Taub did a third. Three tests, three positives. What happened to your eye?",I grabbed Park's ass. Exoplanets.

It's not anxiety. The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife. She confirmed he's been feeling fine. Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.,PRobably also beliEves that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.
Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam. No improvements.,Because!
"Because for some Patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.",You lied?
I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.,Interesting.
Impressive.,"What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?"
Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.,Pain would be restricted to one dermatome. It wouldn't cross them.
Asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.,No history of asthma.
"But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.",Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.
Arceus?,"Look it up. And alkalinize his urine. Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used."
"Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?","Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it. And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it."
Must be such a pleasure to live in your head.,You're right. Kids might be precocious. You handle his House. You handle him and his wife.
They get to just hang out and do nothing?,"If you need help, you can take whoEver you want."
I'll take Taub.,Interesting.
And I'll take Park.,That was fun.
"PPTH room. House is sitting in a couch, sleeping, with his face covered by a magazine. --",Don't tell me. The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.
We didn't find any poisons.,"Well, you obviously found something."
Or break into it.,Cool.
You're not gonna beliEve this.,"Imperio absenti chaos regit. He's worried that ""too big to fail"" applies to our banks but not our government."
How'd you know?,"Because that's what Every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of. Heather Sweeney. Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you."
There's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.,April Donaldson. Sorry. Misspoke.
That's ridiculous.,Ouch.
What? Paranoid?,You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.
"No, we shouldn't. If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.","Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight."
"No, we don't. We have a reasoned disagreement.","Still there's only one way to settle this. Actually there's two, but we don't have enough Jell-O for the first. Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use. Check his TSH lEvels and get a sleep study. Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her."
And it's not a fight.,"Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?"
Mariel Wilkerson.,Huh. You don't look like a Mariel. You're up.
Cafeteria. House and Wilson are getting lunch. --,He's not paranoid. He's just stupid.
"Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group? You own a gun.",Our Patient doesn't own a gun. He owns an arsenal. And I don't own a gun.
"Yes, you do. And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jailï¿½",That is actually not one of the Many reasons that I don't own a gun. Why would I need a gun? The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.
"You don't own anything you need. You own things you want. And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun. You like anything dangerous ï¿½ monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks.",Everyone loves fireworks.
"WatParkng them, not making them.",I'm telling the truth.
I stand corrected.,"If you beliEve me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary."
Absolutely.,"It's not resolved, is it?"
He also spiked a fEver overnight. It could be TB.,You want to say it?
There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.,Yeah. It's med-speak for she's an idiot.
If he's paranoid.,So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?,Now's your chance. She's leading with her Parkn.
I agree with her.,"No, you don't. Which means you're both idiots. Get to work."
I know you don't think I'm an idiot.,Does it matter?
"If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no. But if you feel the need to Manipulate me to make me useful, then yes. I thought we'd gotten past that.","If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here. But ability isn't always enough. Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen."
So this is you trying to help me?,"No, this is me helping me. And amusing myself at your expense. Which brings us back to, why do you care?"
I deserve respect. I'm a good doctor.,People respect you. They just don't like you.
"At first, I thought it might be frostbite, but I haven't really been out in the cold.",And yet your first thought was frostbite?
"Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.",It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.
You serious?,With some difficulty.
Then what is it?,A sign that you need to take a long vacation. At least a month.
"A vacation? Wait, is this like a bucket list thing? It's cancer!",It's silver. I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.
Damn.,"Yeah, damn. It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin. That normally happens Every 30 days. So, I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got the world's largest beer can."
"Sorry. Since Claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.",I miss Claudine.
She left because of you.,I thought that was Nadine.
I thought that was Nadine.,Emergency page takes precedence.
"House's department. As House enters, we see Wilson hanging inside a big net, looking angry. --",Got your page.
You're an ass.,Admit it.
Let me down.,"After you admit it. You know, I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonnaï¿½"
"All right, I admit it. Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd nEver find it because you are more deviousï¿½",ClEver.
I don't think he's a psych case.,Because you're paranoid about paranoia.
which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.,Treat for GAD. Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.
I'm not paranoid. And they don't dislike me. They don't Even really know me.,They tell you that?
I didn't ask because you wouldn't beliEve the answer.,It makes you feel better to think that.
You're the one Everyone dislikes. You pRobably don't Even think it's GAD. You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.,"There's only one way to find out. Actually, there's two but we're still waiting for that Jell-O delivery. Let me know how it goes."
Gotcha!,You poor dumb bastard.
You poor dumb bastard.,Touchï¿½.
"Or it's GAD, and we started treatment too late.",Increase the steroid dose.
"We can't. If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.","With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way. If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection."
"We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late. He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago. He can fight this off if we give him a chance.","Fine. But a shotgun is not gonna work. We need a sniper rifle. Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of."
"You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to justï¿½",I changed my mind.
Butï¿½,Do what Park says.
"Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket ï¿½ I can't imagine why!",Had to kill a mouse. It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.
And my money clip.,Was there any money in it?
Not anymore.,Can I go to bed now? Or do you want to do a cavity search? Lock up on your way out.
So we've got nothing.,Unless he was still being poisoned.
By who? His wife wasn't Even here when he hallucinated.,Good question.
"It is possible, but!",Wouldn't cause hallucinations.
It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.,Get a biopsy.
You think it's cancer?,I think you should get a biopsy.
"Admit it. Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it. I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking. So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.",That's not a gun.
"Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment for .45-caliber bullets.",And that's not a bullet.
Admit it. I'm more clEver and more devious. You can Even have it back. It's not my pRoblem if you go back to prison. My pRoblem is you thinking you're always one step ahead of me.,"This proves nothing because it's not a gun. It's a prop. From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act. Look it up. She's the only Woman to Ever do the ""Catch a Bullet"" trick. I won this off her prop master in a poker game."
Houseï¿½,It's fake! It's plugged. Look for yourself.
"Hey, hey, don't point that thing at me.",It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.
"House, House, just stop it.",Fine.
What the hell are you doing?,Pull the trigger.
Don't be insane.,"They're blanks. You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth. Go ahead. Shoot me."
I'm not shooting you.,All right. I'll shoot you.
"Don't. House, don't. Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.",It's not real. Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun. Which means you proved nothing. Admit it. Admit it.
All right.,"All right, what?"
You win.,And it feels good.
Tommy's room. House walks in. --,"You were wrong. Don't feel too bad. We all were. His trachea wasn't swollen. It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it. It means he's not paranoid, he's an idiot, and was poisoned."
What are you doing?,"Give me a MaParkda scope. Hold his legs. He's not gonna like this. Because you're not gonna be able to breathe. But I need to see down your barrel. Good news is the poison didn't come from your wife. It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations. Call the CDC. Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible."
Diphtheria?,"We didn't guess it because nobody gets it. Instead of building bunkers, you should be getting boosters. As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary."
"In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's Patients regress to old routines.",So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?
Whoops.,How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?
About a week now.,The best dads wait two or more.
"Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious. I-I checked online, and it's! asthma or something.","""Or something"" is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree. When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?"
"Uh, like five months ago. We went a clinic in Trenton. I had strep throat.",You remember the antibiotic they gave you? Is it neomycin?
"Amoxicillin. So about the inhaler for my asthma, I wasï¿½","Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter. Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store. And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait. Which actually doesn't prove anything. The fact that you didn't burst into tears tells me that you nEver thought he was your dad."
Let's get out of here.,"Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around."
"What, so I can get busted by Social Services?","No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear. It's usually a sign of a skull fracture. Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?"
No.,"Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it. No tenderness, no pain. Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something. Ear canal is fine. You don't have a fEver. Pay the Man. He's late for a trashcan fire."
Would you - would you tell me what's going on? What's wrong with me?,I have no idea.
Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?,"Because I can. Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best. So! what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing pRoblems?"
CT confirms no skull fracture. And looking at her confirms she's not 18.,"Yes, she is. Says so in the file."
We can't treat an underage Patient without a guardian. We need to call Social Services.,"I cut a deal with the Patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt."
No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear. S.T.D. panel was negative. And! is that Foreman?,"Oh, my goodness, it is! Hi, Dean Foreman! Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married? Oh, no, wait ï¿½ that's her."
"She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.",In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.
Would explain the lack of fEver. Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population. We should find out if she's been vaccinated.,"Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus."
And if she says she has been vaccinated?,"Then don't beliEve her, and start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus."
How about we don't beliEve she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?,"While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea."
The bathroom's that way.,Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.
"Hello, good sir. My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.","One of us is in the wrong time zone. And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order."
"Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.","It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor."
"Sir, are you questioning my resolve?","Yes, and your sanity. I'm multitasking."
"Uh, General! Don't light out. We swore that we would see the elephant together.","Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their ""elephant."" I could add some mercury, if you want to make it more authentic."
I don't think so.,"So! What causes an ear bleed, breathing pRoblems, and our runaway's inability to run away?"
Fungal infection's off the table. What about transverse myelitis?,Not with normal posterior column function. I've been waiting to do this for months. Pull! Sights seem to be off on this.
We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the Patient to take off. Now she can't. There's no reason for us not to call.,"Well, how about the reason that there's no reason? This is working fine for me. Pull! Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action."
"You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.",Does anyone have a position on our Patient's medical condition?
Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.,"Pull! I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss. There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes."
"You've nEver done this before, have you?","No, I have not. But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't."
Vasculitis fits.,"Start treatment with steroids. She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again."
Not once I call Social Services. I'm not giving up.,"You wanna bet? One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call. You miss, nEver mention it again."
No. Why would I agree?,'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.
Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?,"She took a bet that she knew she'd win. Frankly, I feel violated."
"Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr. Pujols called and said the Patient ran off.","Come on. ""Poo holes."""
You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic Patient.,I was giving you the gift of deniability.
Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.,"No, you're not."
You've got nothing on me. Check your phone.,"Uh! my phone? Oh, right. Yes, I-I did have some pictures on that. But! I also have these. There's the two of you kissing over dinner. Busting a move in a night club. Is that your hand near her nether regions? Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet."
"I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.","Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies."
"Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies.",How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the Man.
Adams is right. You're protecting this girl.,"No, I was wrong. It's the stench of moralizing. I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents."
"You admire this girl. She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own. She's your road not taken.",I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned House with mold.
"House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a Patient. This is a good thing.","It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing."
We need help in here!,Go!
You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?,I paid Mr. Parkps 5 bucks to take a dive.
"Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts. Mr. Parkps looks like he wants it. 100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.",You're on.
How'd the mom seem to you?,"If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron."
Yes!,"Franklin rules. Mr. Parkps drools. Mr. Parkps's owner only feeds him on apples and bananas. Nowhere near enough vitamin A. Pay up. And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison, after Mommie Dearest has given her permission."
Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.,Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter. Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter. Good thing you made it all official.
Not initially. It was a pretty tough conversation. Neither of us is ready,You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.
"We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb. The-the gun slipped andï¿½ I only had blanks in it, but!",It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.
Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sheldon's a! progressive.,Eh ï¿½ compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?
Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity. They nEver drop character while in uniform.,Whereas you just dabble in crazy.
"Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago. We only really started talking again because of the reenactments. They, uh! gave me my brother back.",That's a very moving story. Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.
Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.,"If only it would explain why we've nEver seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing."
It's been mildly elevated.,"Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm. Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP, causes it to expand and contract. Causes the symptoms to come and go."
CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.,"Did I mention they come and go? Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood."
Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories. I think we should discuss this with the Patient and her mom.,"Why? We discussed it right here. Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to loCate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair."
The Patient asked me what I thought.,"I pay you to think inside this room. Outside this room, I pay you to parrot."
It's her choice. She has the right to know!,It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers. You told the mom something you want to beliEve because you don't want to beliEve that this girl might be doing fine parent-free. Which also happens to be what the mom wants to beliEve.
You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?,That Woman sees Everything to do with her daughter through! guilt-colored glasses. It's all her fault.
House! don't! bully her. She's overwhelmed enough.,"Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat."
You must be Dr. House.,I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid. Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm. She needs surgery. What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.
"Well, I can't just leave this up to her.","Then leave it up to me, and just leave."
Ohh. I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.,She hates you. It's actually not such a big deal. There's plenty of kids who hate their parents. What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you. Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives. Your daughter is better off without you. So! let her be better off without you. I'm gonna do the surgery. I'll take the fallout from Social Services.
It's a little late for that. Good night.,Morning!
I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.,Not for your reasons.
You're protecting the girl.,I'm protecting my diagnosis.
And you tested her ï¿½ see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.,That was to show Adams that Mommie Dearest hadn't changed. I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.
"Your Patient's stable? Well, maybe Adams was right. The illness is alcohol-related.","Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for."
You-you hope you're wrong for the sake of the Patient?,I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her. Call me a softie. Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.
"But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.","Which one of you is the cheap bastard? Your uniforms. They're not wool. They're polyester. Cheap polyester. Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony. You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning, which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands. And your collective vomiting."
Because they don't cost anything.,"Brother against brother. Now, that is authentic."
Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.,Check the ventricles.
Ventricles are clear too.,Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst. Inject the dye.
Her BP's dropping. Start her on pressors. We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.,Adams! with me.
"She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells. Maybe she has cancer.","No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins."
She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago ï¿½what about dengue fEver? Cholera?,"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!"
"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida? In a lake or a pond or an Everglade?
Uh!yeah. There's a canal near my mother's House. Do you know what's wrong with her?,Family vacations kill. Come with me. Don't want to explain this twice.
You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD.,"No, she doesn't. Your daughter has ascariasis. It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces. Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming! where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose. Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen. But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs. The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart. A few pills of Mebendazole! She'll be fine."
"Callie agrees with you! that people don't change. She said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there. She'd rather remember her like she is now.",Smart girl.
You got the ending you wanted.,"'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives. Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up. In fact, I Even encourage it. But absolution? You do that on your own time. Or not at all. 'Cause! clearly, you suck at it."
This is Mark Sanchez. Do you know what sound people make about him? Pffftt!,Working late? Husband have her tonight?
And Every night. She broke it off. It's for the best. I'm not really an affair guy after all.,"Sure you are, buddy. You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair. That's why you're reliEved. But don't worry ï¿½ it's not gonna end here. You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else. When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just! escalate things somehow. At least, that's what I've been told."
"I'm not like you, House.",True. No limp.
"Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the Events of February 3, 2012 in Patient room 209. Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings. Do you have any questions before we get started?",Yeah. Who the hell are you?
"I'm Walter Cofield, Parkef of Neurology, Mercy Hospital. I'll be deciding your fate today.","Cofield. You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman. Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you."
"This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House. I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.",It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to Judge the new one.
"Interesting, but not relevant. The facts of this case, on the other handï¿½","The facts are in the file. If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call. I'm going back to work."
"If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor. The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.",The Patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher. He collapsed while out jogging. He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans!
Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.,Put out an APB for a car with a Man-shaped dent in the grill?
"No broken bones, no signs of trauma.",Transverse myelitis. Boring.
No enhancement on the MRI. I just don't know what to do. Please. You have to help me solve this thing.,A little poetic license.
What are you doing?,Taking my Vic-amins.
Those are Vicodin? Did you have surgery recently?,About a decade ago. My leg is no good at judging time.
Were you taking Vicodin during this case?,Uhh! Yes. And during about nine years of previous cases. My process is proven. Good things usually happen. Bad things sometimes happen.
"And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.",So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen. It was nobody's fault.
And then what happened?,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach gym. Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others."
And why did House think that was stupid?,"Oh, come on. Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot."
The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP.,That's what I said.
That's what I said.,"No, you idiot. The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP. Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time."
Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?,That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.
"You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing ""unsquint your eyes""? It's not the place to exorcise your guilt just bï¿½","I actually used the phrasing ""unsquint your eyes."""
EKG was normal.,"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!"
"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!","!steroids, PTU, and beta blockers."
Mm-hmm. And how did these orange smudges get on the Patient files?,"Seriously? That's your follow-up? I eat a lot of Cheetos, I forget to wash my hands. Is my snacking really relevant to this case?"
"Seriously, House?",You're blaming me? You used Adams' shampoo.
I didn't do it.,It was a harmless prank. My team is made up of Type A personalities. They need something to break the tension Every once in a while.
Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.,"That's also true. Either way, I'm covered. If you want an accurate Patient history, don't Ever talk to the Patient. Everybody lies. Except me. To you. Would nEver do that."
"Okay. Say you're right. If you had actually been in the room, questioning the Patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.",Don't forget the thumbscrews.
"Looks like you've gone viral, hon.","He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis! But when I was told the Patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting."
"Your Patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?","Why, is that bad?"
"He smacked his head against the wall. If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to Eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.",Nobody move.
Mm-hmm.,You can leave when I have an answer.
It might help if we knew the question.,How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?
Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.,Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified. How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the Patient?
Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.,Burn cream would drown him faster than water. Well?
Aerosolized heparin.,Me likey.
But that's only experimental. It's nEver actually been used before.,Not true.
Not true.,Been used in sheep.
Uh-huh.,The guy was going downhill fast. We needed a treatment that was a! slope changer.
So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?,It was a team-building exercise.
No. It was Manipulation. You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.,"You say pressure, I say inspire. The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized heparin might."
How does Dr. House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?,I run a diagnostic trial.
I run a diagnostic trial.,"Start the Patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fEver, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross ""brain"" off the list!"
"Start the Patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fEver, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross ""brain"" off the list!","!diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured."
"Are you trying to make this easy for me? By your own admission, if you give the Patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.",What was making the Patient worse was not having a diagnosis. This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.
"In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?",Yes. My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes. It did not account for the disobEdience of my own team.
So your position is that your team's disobEdience caused this?,That's not what I said.
"You said you didn't anticipate their defiance. You implied that all would have been fine otherwise. So who do you blame, Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase? Or both?",I don't blame either one.
"Got to move it, people.",My diagnostic test worked. It proved the Patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.
And that's what you took away from this situation?,The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.
Your colleague was stabbed. Are you telling me you didn't care?,How bad is it?
I can't take my finger out. He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.,Oxygenation's at 100%. He's as ready as he's gonna be.
Patch is holding.,What was his heart rate?
He doesn't have one. He's on bypass.,Not Chase. The Patient.
You're DDX-ing?,"Park, come with me. Taub's got this."
My friend is here because you didn't listen to me.,"I did listen to you. Chase didn't listen to me. At this point, being here makes you feel better. You're not helping Chase or our Patient. Fine."
Thank you.,"Lungs, rash, now excessive RR variability. Go."
It's a hospital. There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.,"And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing? If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dediCated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way."
She's not pregnant.,Would it make a difference? 'Cause I could knock her up. Autonomic dysregulation.
"I don't think it was anyone's fault. I was angry, but I wasn't distracted. And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr. House is a genius.",How about warmth? Can you feel the sheets on your skin?
That'd mean the damage was perManent.,No. Forget the nerves.
"House, if it's total paralysis, he must have!",Not necessarily. Think arteries. Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off. It's a clot in the radicular artery.
That could be fixable.,Prep a room for an embolectomy. Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.
And if it's not a clot?,Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.
Don't get too excited. We still got to get it out. Still could have done perManent damage.,Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag. Kidneys are failing.
"House, not now.",Got to be now. Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton general as soon as there's a bed available. Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.
This will be our last round of questions. I've spoken with Dr. Chase. You know he regained movement.,No.
Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?,"We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?"
Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry!,I didn't do anything wrong.
"It's not an admission of guilt. He's your friend, and he's not well.",He's a coworker.
Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.,Are you going to have me fired for bad Manners?
"Just trying to understand you. Why a Man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.",Could we go back on the record and get this over with?
"Put the Vicodin away, Dr. House.",My leg hurts.
Is that supposed to be funny?,Two explosions.
We're not done here.,"Hey, hold on."
"Hey, hold on.",Take him out of there.
Take him out of there.,Hey!
Hey!,Wait. Wait.
I have to get to my car. I don't! I nï¿½,Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.
You've been wrong Every time.,"Yeah, well, not this time. The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open. It's called tumor lysis syndrome. His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk. It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, Everything."
What about the psychotic break?,Turns out we caused that. This is treatable. Okay? You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.
"Move your cane, please.",Where's Cofield?
He said you walked out.,"Well, I'm walking back. I'm not done testifying."
This case is a fiasco. Didn't sleep last night. Dr. House is obviously brilliant!,"Well, I think we've heard enough."
"I know. I came to speak with Dr. House. And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something. I mean! he wasn't the nicest doctor I've Ever met.","Well, I think we've heard enough."
"As I was saying, Dr. House's process is dangerous, inappropriate. But he is effective. I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process. Congratulations, Dr. House. This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.",Coward.
Excuse me?,"You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there. You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour. You got my parole form in here. You were gonna send me back to prison."
"House, stop.","Good things usually happen; Bad things sometimes happen. The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing."
"Good things usually happen; Bad things sometimes happen. The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.",How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?
Why'd I Even have to? What was the point of the orange hair?,"Your hair smelled like Adams. And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo. Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or, because there is no new girl, you were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo. So I found a way to let you know to not be late."
You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?,What fun would that be?
"None of this is fun, House.",They decided that your being stabbed! was nobody's fault. They're wrong. I'm sorry.
Anything else? I'm kind of busy.,No. That was it.
I was stabbed by a Patient. That'll teach me to overbill.,"If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes."
What do you want?,"45 year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures. No metabolic or structural!"
Does this look like a good time?,Sort of. At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.
Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you. Kinda like now.,"I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one. You do work for me. I am entitled to ask when you're coming back."
Stress test too. It's not angina. So why the shoulder pain?,Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?
I didn't tell him.,You were cagey about where you were going. And Chase being cagey in general. Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage. So I had Park follow you.
Good to see you on your feet.,Patient's a nun? You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?
She was next up in the clinic. And I don't want your help.,You got stabbed. You blame me.
You got stabbed. You blame me.,But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?
Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.,Or maybe the rEverse is true.
Thanks for all your help.,Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads. Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.
Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads. Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.,Thanks for all my help.
Not a fungal infection.,"You're pRobably wondering, why the soda balloons?"
I'm not.,"Well, I'll tell you. You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle. Taub has decided!"
I need help with my Patient. She's vomiting. That's not from a fungal infection.,What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?
I have no idea. Almost dying's been clarifying. I can do anything.,You can do anything. So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years. Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.
Can we get to my Patient sometime soon?,"As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure."
"You'll help me. 'Cause Even though you don't find my case interesting, you find my interest in it interesting.","Well, when you put it that way! Ascending colangitis."
"Can't be, bilirubin's normal.",Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.
Ha ha ha!,This is great. We should make this a regular thing.
Ketosteroid lEvels are low. How can he be hyper-sexual?,He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer. You think his sexuality is normal?
I need more help. My Patient has a new symptom. Ischemic foot. Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.,Let me start with an allegory.
"Okay, I'm curious.",Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me Even as you are drawn to me. Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.
Krav Maga. Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.,"Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger."
I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.,And the sEventh? And the eighth? And the Nth?
"If you get him, what's that gonna prove?","That unexpected things happen. By definition, no class can teach you to expect them. Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them."
"That unexpected things happen. By definition, no class can teach you to expect them. Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.",Blood clot.
Her D-dimer's normal.,On the other hand!
That explains Everything but the lymph nodes. And any minor infection,Calcium channel blocker to treat.
It is gonna be hard. Not touParkng anyone.,Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie. No wonder you're playing handsies with her.
You think I'm hitting on a nun? Angry at God or I just need a challenge?,"Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut. But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft. Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option. That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing."
"Bounding, four-plus. It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.","Twenty? Thought she just got here. That blood looks pretty dry. Cut yourself shaving? You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you."
"Former, to both.","Internal neck trauma, that's impressive. It's happened to me a few times. Up high."
Tell him!,Do the surgery.
You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a Patient's life.,He's the better surgeon.
We removed the artery. I found nodules.,Could mean lupus.
Negative A.N.A. Where are you going?,Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up. Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.
Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up. Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.,And then!
And then!,Two to the head.
Can we talk about my Patient?,Quite a journey. Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun. What's the plan?
Plan's to cure her.,"Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game. You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile. You sure you want!"
"Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game. You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile. You sure you want!","Oh, my God. Taub is interrogating the janitor. He must think that I hired him to attack! actually, why didn't I do that? Plaques could be confused for nodules. Which would mean!"
Syphilis.,Explains the shoulder and foot involvement. Hope you practiced immaculate contraception.
Explains the shoulder and foot involvement. Hope you practiced immaculate contraception.,Lock and load.
Lock and load.,Boo-yah!
Boo-yah!,Pfft!
"Checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout. Thrombus?","That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is, not surprisingly, wrong. Abdominal ultrasound was negative."
Wilson said it wasn't cancer.,Wilson says it's not breast cancer.
Then we've got to biopsy.,"Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong. You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved. I know you want to beliEve that this is something we can cure. It's not. I'm sorry."
She has jaw claudication. If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection!,I'd say giant cell arteritis. And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.
She's gonna live.,Yeah. And then what?
Now! I think I love you.,"""Noradrenaline and near-death experiences."" Oh, dear. You saw God?"
She did. She wants to go back to the monastery.,So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights. You're an idiot.
Because I found someone I love?,Because you're an idiot. At least you two have that in common.
Her feelings are based on a chemical process. They're gonna wear off.,You just slept with her. Your brain is exploding with oxytocin. You think that's gonna last through the ages?
She's throwing away her life because of blind faith.,"So are you! She's found something she wants to build her life around. It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss. And you want to take that away?"
How Many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?,"Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily Ever after."
"Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily Ever after.","Either your relationship just blows up like Every other non-magical roMance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life."
"This has nothing to do with the truth. You don't like that I'm reassessing my life, that I want to change it, that I can.",Anyone can screw up a life. I nEver said that wasn't possible.
"You're incapable of huMan connection, so you want Everyone to be like you.","If I wanted you to be like me! I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable. You reassess your life when you've made mistakes. You didn't. You just got stabbed."
40 year-old water treatment worker with pyrexia and double vision.,! You said he worked in a sewer!
I'm good. Your limp's almost gone.,"It pains me to interrupt the collegial banter, it pains me Even more to listen to it continue. 38-year-old Man. Spikes a fEver and collapses during a speaking engagement. E.R. checks out blood volume, cardiac function, and autonomic reflexes, all normal."
"E.R. did a head CT. No sign of AVM. Decent thought, though.","The Patient's philosophy makes perfect sense. Its only flaw is that it's impossible. Evolution does not work that way. You can't talk legs onto a fish. We're gonna go extinct, and we're gonna do it drinking scotch and driving muscle cars. Am I right? Am Iï¿½ Thank you."
"It doesn't explain the fEver. The Patient's talking about compromise. If you don't think that's possible, you don't think relationships are possible.",Anyone in this room in a position to disprove that?
Less invasive than the angiogram. Good idea.,"Fine. Now, I am hereby searParkng for a number two. So I'm eating a lot of bran. Also, I want a team leader. Someone to fill Foreman's old job."
Why?,You're right. We don't need any more structure. It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.
You're right. We don't need any more structure. It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.,"Well, if it isn't the old ball and Ukraine."

"I start Ukrainian food truck business. After gambling ï¿½ win, lose ï¿½ Everybody likes a little knish.","You're here, and I seem to remember throwing out a bunch of certified letters from immigration. I'm assuming there's a connection."
"Our green card interview is in four days. They come to the apartment, they ask questions about marriage, vacations, family history, what side of the bed each sleep on.","We've nEver taken a vacation, I don't like your family, and on top. I hear Kiev is lovely this time of year. And your mother, who may or may not be dead for all I know, misses you."
Can it be that genius doctor is afraid to take on a silly government apparatParkk?,"Well, I would say more not interested than afraid, but why quibble?"
"We'll need to know exactly how you changed your diet, and when.",Need my apartment key back.
"If you're breaking up with me, can we at least talk about it first?",Maybe if you weren't all nag and no shag.
I don't sleep with married men.,I'll get a copy made.
"You're an ex-con. If you get caught perjuring yourself to Homeland Security, you'll end up back in jail.",And that would be troubling if there was the slightest chance that we'd get caught.
You barely know each other. You've got about five minutes to remake yourselves into a convincing married couple. And! why? Dominika gets a green card. What's in this for you?,"This is what men do for the women they pretend to love. Also, she's paying me 30,000 bucks once we pass. Apparently knishes sell like hotcakes."
Lab results.,Afraid you're gonna have to finish your nag later.
"And our Patient's a true beliEver about the follies of masculinity. He underwent a spiritual overhaul three years ago. He also went off gluten and red meat. Unfortunately, that doesn't explain any of his symptoms.",One of those points is not absurd.
What's absurd about a change of heart? What this guy beliEves is making him a better person. He's going against his baser instincts.,"""Base"" meaning foundational. Meaning things we are biologically programmed to do. Yes, perfectly natural that he stopped doing that stuff. You know, that's the kind of lapse that could take you out of the running for team leader."
I feel surprisingly okay with that.,Comes with a 50-buck-a-week raise.
You don't want to do that. Might need your dignity later in life.,You didn't. And she could be on her way to living the dream unless the rest of you nut up and give herï¿½ This spiritual overhaul! did it come after a physical overhaul? A major injury of some kind?
Bar fight. But there's no way a broken wrist explainsï¿½,"Adams, come with me. You too. You guys! get a copy of that made."
"Adams, come with me. You too. You guys! get a copy of that made.",Did those dudes bend your ball sack like Beckham? Three years ago. The bar fight.
This is Dr. House. He has a theory.,"Oh, Dr. Adams, would you mind? I asked you a question. I assume you know the answer."
"Yeah, I took a couple serious knees to the groin.",Wha ï¿½ what has gotten into me? Dr. Chase. Just pick it up.
Do you know what's wrong with me?,"Nothing that The Golden Girls couldn't have handled in 23 hilarious minutes. You had a hot flash. Those guys kicked your guys hard enough to do lasting damage. You didn't Even look when presented with two reasonably attractive tuPark. Yeah, I said it!"
I was listening to my doctor.,"People generally listen with their ears, leaving their eyes free to wander. I'm guessing that your testosterone lEvel is just below ""Bieber."" Do a blood test to confirm, and start hormone replacement. It's no wonder that you think women are so great. You've basically been one for the last three years."
It's not a plumbing pRoblem. Means it's pRobably neurological.,And?
And name Dominika's three brothers.,"Uh! Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and! aaugf."
Low testosterone is off the table as a symptom. Guy got his nuts cracked three years ago. Don't need to look much further than that.,So his hose just happens to spring a leak at the same time he's in a hospital for a totally unrelated pRoblem. Fjodor.
"If low testosterone means I can't get sick with something else, then punch me in the junk right now.","I would, if it weren't redundant. Is Fedir the one who married Mykola?"
"How is it you can retain Every detail of our habits and personal lives, and none of this?","'Cause I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about. Ergo, Dominika has one brother, and his name is Al."
"Maybe the testicular damage set the stage for something worse. Multiple Sclerosis causes incontinence, and progresses faster in men with low T.",Way to stay on point. It's that kind of leadership that's putting you at the head of the pack.
There is no pack. She's the only applicant.,"Well, that's settled, then. Have your underlings do an LP and get a cranio-spinal MRI to check for plaques associated with M.S. I will go tell Foreman about your promotion."
You just don't want anyone else to have it. This'll be great.,Your grandmother's kind of sexy.

You nEver know when you might need to make a pie chart.,Looks like someone is currying favor for the team leader position.

"Ooh, a little one. He'd be a good pick.","Smooth. You let the rest of them compete, tear each other to pieces, then you swoop in with a save. Start the Patient on IVIG and plasmapheresis."
"Can you handle that, please? I need a minute.","Well, make it quick. We're doin' Memphis."
"You think you want this, but it's a bad idea.","I was gonna go Dollywood, but I'm not sure I could pull off that wig."
"Everybody was playing nice, and in your world, nice doesn't solve cases, but after what happened, a little bonding is a good thing. We still have ideas, we still argue. Maybe it could work better if we appreciate each other.",That was impressive. You said that whole thing without once moving your lips. The ones you're not moving.
"Oh. I get it. I won't play along with your stupid games, so I'm no longer a Man. ClEver.","Actually, you won't play along with my stupid games because you're no longer a Man. Still clEver, though. Studies have shown that raising kids lowers testosterone lEvels in men. The more involved you are, the lower it gets."
Okay.,"Fedir is the brother she worries about the most. Ever since Luba passed. Sorry. But this is the closest we could find to the cold, soulless offices of a government bureaucracy."
Does Dominika still communiCate with her high school friends?,"Uh, Vasyl, yes. Oksana, no. Not since she kissed Pavlo. 'Cause that bitch knew that Dominika liked him."
So much for myasthenia gravis.,Can we hurry this up? I have a government to defraud at noon.
"Just until I realized our Patient has no sign of parenchymal lung abnormalities, which makes sarcoidosis a long shot. And bookkeeping isn't gonna get you any farther than boobs.","Though in fairness, the boobs were really, really helping."
So your theory is that he has two unrelated diseases. And he's already got low testosterone. I seem to remember something about House hating coincidences.,It's true.

"Uh, do you remember the last time she visited Vasyl?","Uh, let me see, that would be! August? No. No, July. 'Cause I remember it was right after our half-anniversary, and I forgot to put a gift in her suitcase. And! I've nEver heard the end of that one."
Mm-hmm.,"Honey, why do you do this to me? You know I'm watParkng my weight."
You're that guy that plays noisy video games with House on Saturday nights.,There's a simple explanation.
Or because he doesn't have Lyme disease. Where are you?,"Oh, just Parkllin'. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. Waiting on my fraud interview with my wife and my attorney. No big."
"Either you're done, or you're walking in there without a Lawyer.","I know, it sounds like a phone, but it's a timer to remind me to pee before our meeting. Hello, old chap."
"You need to save yourself. I was up last night trying to find another angle, but I can't. Tell immigration you were in love with Dominika, but your marriage fell apart, and that's why you haven't been living together.","She'll be deported, perManently."
"House, I know you like Dominika, you have fun with her, but you got caught. There's no getting out of this. The best you could hope for is that you don't go back to jail.",Tell my team to-to skip the biopsy and give the antibiotics more time.
Don't answer that.,Way ahead of you.

His voice ï¿½ it's lower than it is now.,If only there was a good reason for a professional speaker to be hoarse.
Good point.,It's not a good point. It's a decent point. You're doing it again. You have any other videos? Other seminars?
"When you see a weakness, that's a time for strength. A lot of people say, ""Oh, I feel bad about it. The other guy made a mistake.""",You bailed too early. Now I get all the credit.

But I'm not hoarse.,"Exactly. But you were three years ago. Silent thyroiditis comes and goes. And it, in turn, is a symptom of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 3, which makes this a really bad idea. PAS 3 attacks the body's own endocrine system, moving from gland to gland. It started in the thyroid, and pRobably helped along by your low testosterone, moved on to the gut."
"Where it caused celiac disease, or it would've if you weren't on a gluten-free diet. I was right.","This is incredibly relevant. Eventually, PAS 3 attacked your thymus gland. You dEveloped myasthenia gravis, which landed you in here, and you started eating gluten, which only made things worse."
And the testosterone?,Kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.
Kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.,"Over the past week, you've all had good moments and bad. No one candidate has prevailed. And so now, we embark upon a contest of medical strength, stamina, and skill."

Who are you hiding from?,Evil.
Maybe his girlfriend poisoned him. House usually thinks that's a good guess. And she's gotta be pissed off and have low self-esteem. Why else would she give him a free pass to pork other women?,Because he's handicapped. Women feel sorry for us. This cane is tail bait.
"Hi, guys. Was wondering if House's mother left yet. He won't let me go to our housï¿½","It's not environmental, it's periodontitis."
An oral infection doesn't explain his disorientation and auditory hallucinations.,They're laughing because they know diabetes exacerbates the condition.
It could progress to a systemic disease. The bacteria spread and affect other organs.,Like his brain. Start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics and book him an appointment with a periodontist.
You think I'm not good enough for your mother.,"Not in front of the kids, Honey. Hey, add a couple of flies, toss in a dead goat or two, we might have a winner. She gone?"
Yeah. We really need to talk.,Okay. Crayons down. Line up if you wanna get paid. It's the only time I Ever successfully lie to my mom; is through the elaborate preparations and props.

You sleeping with her now?,Just in case an I.N.S. guy comes in through the window.
Oh.,"Yeah, she didn't buy it either."
You need to talk to your mother.,"When I'm ready. Still need to get a fake passport, doctored photos, maybe a case of AIDS."
"She's sick, House.",Did she say that?
Greg.,Sorry I didn't call first. I just flew back from my conference.
"Um, thisï¿½this really isn't, uhï¿½",I need your medical records and the name of your primary physician.
"Well, you remember Mr. Bell.","Well, if I didn't, I will now. You're not dying?"
"Yeah. This isn't how I envisioned you finding out. Mr. Bell and I, we're!",Having sex. Got it.
"Coincidence. Buying that, House?",Until I hear something that takes my mind off the Jurassic schlong that I was traumatized by this afternoon.
You pretty much look the same as you always do.,Take your glasses off. Pupils dilated! Pulse elevated. Hallucinating?
She ate ice cream and Gummi Bears at the Patient's apartment. One of 'em must have been dosed with it.,"Go back and find the drugs. You two, find out where he bought them, and then MRI his brain. Check for infections, masses, and plaques."
Am I gonna die?,We'll get back to you on that.
Have you seen your mother yet?,She's not dying. She was having sex with my father. Ignore her. She's on acid.
"Your father's dead, House.","Not the dead dad, the biological dad. The one I pointed out to you at fake father's funeral."
Huh. Are you sure? Your only evidence is that birthmark you saw when you were 12.,"Well, now I've seen two. Good news is, I won't technically be a bastard much longer. We're gonna be one big, crappy family."
"Well, that's-that's great news. Your mother won't be alone anymore, and you can finally get to know the guy.","Yes, that is one option."
Are you saying you're not Even curious? You want to know what I think?,I think you know the answer to that question.
You avoid your mother because she's the one person whose opinion you actually care about.,"If that was true, you'd have Every reason to shut up. I avoid my mother because she's boring."
That's why you've been so open and honest about prison and marrying a complete stranger.,"Even if I care what she thinks, why would I care what some sperm donor does?"
You read the guy's book about three times.,Years ago. It took three times because it was so badly written.
Where's Park?,Wilson's babysitting her. Talking about the fact that she could have perManent brain damage might bum her trip out a little bit.
A dark spot doesn't necessarily equal brain damage. It could be a congenital malformation connected with his blindness or a tumor.,A clot.

Confirm with an eye exam, start treatment with heparin for the clot. Interferon and steroids for the Behcet's."
"Ah, she finally fell asleep. I think she'll be fine in a couple of hours.",How do you know about handling a bad acid trip? Friends in your gardening club been experimenting again?
"And I've known Greg almost since he was born, you know. His father and I were like brothers. I was a Navy chaplain in those days. I left the service in the late '60s. I don't think his dad Ever forgave me for protesting the war. Of course, if he knew I'd got Blythe involved!",You protested the war? When?
"Well we knew if we told you, you'd tell him, and he'd kill us both. He was a marine. It was the ultimate betrayal.",Penultimate.
"If we do that and he starts hemorrhaging, we won't be able to stop the bleeding.","If we don't do that, the next clot could cause a heart attack or a stroke. Park's way, he at least has a shot at living. CT his lungs to confirm, and up the dose."
"Practically walked in on us having sex. God, if I saw my mother doing that, I'd claw my own eyes out. Of course, she was nowhere near as attractive as you. Horribly fat, as a matter of fact.","Mother! Guy sleeping with my mother, this is Dominika, my wife."
"It's so nice to be meeting you. And Gregory tells me that you were born in Richmond, Virginia, and your father was a tailor who stole from his clients.",James has persuaded me of the value of openness and honesty in relationships.
"I'm sure that's exactly what disabled people want, to be treated like completely foreign entities, incapable of being Judged and understood. Park was right about the clot. Hopefully the anticoagulants keep it from killing him.","So! she gets the couch on the odd nights, and I get the bed on Evens. In exchange for a federal felony, she gets a green card, and I get a live-in maid."
Thank you! Dad.,I'm grateful you approve. You should also know that I was not in Africa the last year.
You were in jail. I've been reading the Princeton police blotter Ever since you moved here. And I'm afraid I haven't been truthful with you either. And I've wanted to tell you this for a very long time. Thomas and I! we got married two months after your father passed away.,Uh-huh.
"You understand, we didn't want you to think we were disrespecting the memory of your father.",And! is there another secret that you want to share with me?
No.,There's nothing you think might be relevant to my life?
Like! what?,"I don't know. Just off the top of my head, something like I DNA-tested my dad and found that he was not my biological father ï¿½ you are."
That's impossible.,People lie. Birthmarks don't.
"Look at him sitting there ï¿½ a pill-popping sociopath! If you wanted to screw up his life, you couldn't have done it better.","He's got you there, mom."
"I can't deal with this anymore. He's my son? I'm having a bloody breath of fresh air, that's what I'm doing.","So, who's for dessert?"
"No, it couldn't. No evidence of viral markers in the necrotized tissue.","Let me see that image you took last night of the clot in his lung. That's not a piece of the clot from his brain. That's the point of infection. Mucormycosis. He breathed in the spores, it's been growing and spreading Ever since."
A fungal infection spreading this fast?,Kid's a diabetic. He already has a compromised immune system.
He's right. This sample from his eyes is crawling with it.,Treat with amphotericin B.
"We treated him with gentamicin when we thought it was bacterial, which means the dose of amphotericin B we'll need to cure him will pRobably leave him deaf.","Sorry, I stopped listening after you said ""the dose we'll need to cure him."""
"Oh, hi. I'm here to apologize. I could have handled the news with more! aplomb? I have a son. That's great news.",What else did she tell you to say?
"You're not a lunatic, you're not a mistake.",I nEver liked your friend! my father.
"Well, he could be a bit intense at times.","But unlike you, I did respect him."
You said yï¿½,How long are you gonna wait until you tell me?
I thought we already had the Santa Claus talk.,You don't think I saw you steal Thomas' fork from the restaurant?
Why would I do that?,For his DNA.
That's! that's! very observant of you.,"See, you're more me than you pretend. You had to know for sure. So you needed proof. The fact that you haven't told me can only mean!"
He isn't your father either. I'm sorry.,You know what that means.
Your mom's a slut.,That! and! she's not as boring as I thought she was.
"There will be MPs stationed at Every entrance to the second floor, as well as outside his Patient room.","No. Don't do that. Every time there's people in uniform in the cafeteria, they get served first."

Give those back.,Why? You got 28. You can share.
"He's not contesting the treason charges. If his code of honor is that strong, he's not gonna bother faking symptoms.",Pleading guilty is not honorable. It's just stupid.
No pain when he swallows.,What is honor? Dying for your country? Getting straight As? Killing your daughter because she had the audacity to get raped?
Pancreatitis. Gallstones obstructing his pancreatic duct.,People define honor as whatEver makes them feel honorable. It's a circle going nowhere. Which I guess is what circles do.
I need your signature on this order. The Army's leaning on Foreman to make sure this is done by the book.,Didn't need an order for his last treatment.
This last treatment wasn't a treatment.,Forge it.
House.,Shh. I'm with a Patient.
Shh. I'm with a Patient.,Sleep study.
You drugged him?,I didn't say the study was voluntary.
I think you're sick.,"What, 'cause I'm sleeping in the clinic like I always do?"
Slow reaction time.,Because I just woke up from sleeping in the clinic like I always do.
You're forgetful.,Sorry. What did you say?
You forgot that we were supposed to have lunch.,"I didn't forget. I was sleeping, in the clinicï¿½"
I'd like to run some tests.,For what? Where's this coming from?
Hepatic encephalopathy. I've watched you destroy your body with Vicodin for years. I'm surprised your liver's lasted this long. I'll do the examination myself.,"While having you juggle my jewels sounds interesting, there's no such thing as friends with benefits. It always gets weird."
"No, I don't.",You're forfeiting? 'Cause if you can't play the game and work!

PPD's negative. Could be bruï¿½,Don't interrupt Dr. Taub.
Brucellosis. You just took out a family of four.,"They were clearly armed insurgents, and anyone who claims or proves otherwise is a traitor. No rash or back pain."
"You defend the Patient for being a whistleblower, then attack him for being an honorable whistleblower. Now you defend him for being a maligned, honorable whistleblower?","Adjectives matter. Hate nurses, love naughty nurses. Taub, pitch again."
I've pitched like fiveï¿½,It's your turn.
Yes!,"Taub, pitch again. Now."
The nodules in his spleen were granulomas. He's got sarcoidosis!,Someone tell him he's wrong.
Yes! Yes!,"Sarcoidosis it is. Treat with steroids. Then come right back here, 'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've made orphans of all your virtual Parkldren."
"The Patient was refusing treatment because of honor, and his brother is refusing to be his conservator because of honor.","Oh, good. Taub's cured the Patient."
I had to go to the bathroom.,Bathroom's that way. You just ran in from that way.
I'm not lying. It's out of order.,I beliEve you. I'm gonna fix it.
What if we aerosolize steroids and blast the room?,Speaking of which!
Speaking of which!,It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right. No one fixes anything unless they have a compelling reason.
It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right. No one fixes anything unless they have a compelling reason.,"If we're gonna treat, we have to give him a compelling reason, something that he wants more than an interview. Fire in the hole!"
It's completely cyanotic. This isn't sarcoidosis.,Cholesterol embolization.
Are you Even gonna acknowledge what we just told you?,"That you pilfered my poo-poo? Yeah, I was thinking, it would be less awkward for all of us if we could just pretend that nEver happened."
It's not an embolization. No instrumentation inside the arteries.,Thank you for getting us backï¿½
"And if we start you on treatment now, get you off Vicodinï¿½","What's the opposite of ""thank you""? I'm pretty sure it ends in ""you"". I know my body. I'm fine. Methemoglobinemia."
"If you're not sick, then our test, accurate 99.5% of the time, yielded a false positive, three separate times. The odds of that are in 1 in 8 million.",The test is accurate. The diagnosis isn't. Sample was obviously contaminated with other foods interacting with my liver enzymes. Now could we talk about the sick Patient?
If we had a Patient file with the same symptoms you're exhibiting!,"And the symptoms I'm not exhibiting? Jaundice, ascites, fetor hepaticus."
You'd still diagnose hepatic encephalopathy. I know that because four doctors you trained have unanimously diagnosed you with hepatic encephalopathy.,Park's right. Treat the Patient with Heparin.
"And until we do, there's no reason to do anything more than what we've done.","Blurry vision! headache, a bit of nausea, and dizziness. I am com-pletely baffled."

I've scheduled a liver function test.,"If I ignore you, then you'll just ignore my ignoring. Which is rude, frankly."
"Depending on the results, we'll customize a treatment plan.","If I tell you I think I'm sick and I need your help and we need to set up a time to talk about it, you'll just assume I'm lying. Again, rude. Also hurtful."

Who are you?,"Well, considering the only people allowed in this room are your doctors and your family! I'm your long-lost cousin Ralph. So glad to finally meet you."
Are you gonna check on me?,It's gonna be at least two hours until we can tell if the Heparin's working.
Then what are you doing here?,"You know, my father taught me that it's dishonorable to interrupt someone when they're reading."
Honor's not a punch line. Get out of my room.,"So was it worth it? Best case, you spend the rest of your life in Leavenworth. Worst case, you spend the rest of your life here."
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs anything the Army can do to me.,They got justice? Do they know that? What if only ten people had died? Four?
Even one civilian death!,What if they just maimed a few guys? Would that have been worth it?
"My job was to log that tape, get all the details in the official record. After the tenth time of watParkng it, I stopped trying to convince myself that the shovel could have been mistaken for a gun.

"You want to reject our current diagnosis because he had a few gray hairs, panicked, and shaved his head?",I want to reject our current diagnosis because I think we're wrong. And treating for wrong diagnoses can result in side effects like death.
"Even if he did full go gray, stress seems way more likely than Grave's.","I haven't read any journal articles proving that veterans have a higher incidence of depigmentation. Of course, that could be the hepatic encephalopathy talking."

It's not Bernard Soulier.,"Bold move. You've gone from speculating I'm sick, to acting like I'm dead."

Talk to you for a minute?,"Anything you have to say to me, you can say to them. It's only fair. Cause"
"Until you receive a clean bill of health, I'll be authorizing all treatment orders.","Well, I would say that that was an incredibly stupid mistake but apparently I'd have to clear that opinion through Foreman first."
Unlikely without pneumonia.,Taub. Loyalty issues in his personal life. Makes sense that they'd cross over into his professional one.
I was hoping we can get a diagnosis before the witch hunt.,The Patient's infection is an inherently less interesting puzzle than the stab wound to my back.
Patient isn't in enough pain.,No. I don't mean about dengue. I have no idea. Taub's only confessing because he wants us to focus on the Patient.
I did.,The next person to confess is fired. Or Spartacus.
"For clarification, no one's getting fired. Who else has a pitch?",And then! there's Park. The only one who didn't confess. The same cowardice that makes someone unable to move out of mommy and daddy's home might also make someone a tattletale.

Oh! Sand art. I used to love this.,"He's bitter, not mentally handicapped. Who knows what Beth told him about you? At worst, you're a rapist. At best, you're a rapist."
Maybe she said I was a dead war hero.,"Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father. Oh, I know! Squirrel handcuffs. You think he's gotten any of those?"
"If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information, then why did you give it to me?","Because you were pining for a kid, and you deserved to know that you already had one. But your parental cravings are more theoretical than applied. You want vicarious immortality more than you want a lifelong burden."
You're assuming he's going to be a nightmare. What if he's a good kid?,He's a kid. Best you can hope for is he's a nightmare.
"Aside from the guy in the book depository, the Kennedys had a lovely trip to Dallas. Repetitive blows to the head can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy, symptoms of which are aggressive behavior and depression.",So your theory is that his aggressive behavior caused his aggressive behavior. He's not depressed. He's just bummed because he knows he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight away from being a barista. I understand that can get to a guy after a while.
"If he quits being an enforcer, it could save his life.",You don't want to save his life. You want to kill his career.
I moved into Chase's apartment. He knows. He was staring at our matParkng cups. I told you we should split up. We're not having sex. With each other!,Yet.
"But an MRI of his brain could rEveal white matter disintegrity, which is the effect of CTE.",Why? Are you trying to sleep with her? 'Cause the simpler technique is just to ask.
I was doing something nice.,"Mm, no. Thï¿½ mm. No, that doesn't fit."
Three reported concussions. These guys are taught in high school how to dupe the tests.,Guilt?
It's not guilt. Park is a friend.,"So it's guilt. Chase convinced you to leave mommy, and now he feels responsible. No MRI. Do a psych eval. If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home."
"That's a density. I know you think I'm convincing myself, but this brain has been hammered for years, meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there.","Meaning you see what you want to see. Unless, of course, Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage."
Patient's stroking out.,Chase? Can you get me out ofï¿½ Ohh! Hello?
Chase? Can you get me out ofï¿½ Ohh! Hello?,"The good news is, it's isolated ophthalmoplegia, which means you didn't have a stroke. Bad news is, Taub was right. You're still sick. I said ""right,"" not ""competent."" Bursts your CTE bubble. You're going to need a whole new theory to keep Uncle Jesse and his Olsen twins on the bench."
And he's been on the road since he was 14.,So he was trash Even before he was trash? You curious about what he wanted?
"I assume he wanted me off the case, and you told him I was hit in the head as a Parkld, and your mother made you promise to take care of me.","He was doing what he always does ï¿½ sticking up for the little guy. He told me to apologize to you, or he would! excrete down my throat. I'm paraphrasing. So if he should ask, I was a gentleMan, or I will excrete down your throat."
MPA can progress quickly. We may not have time before it reaches his lungs.,I think you're right. Thus confirming my objectivity. Start the treatment.
I think you're right. Thus confirming my objectivity. Start the treatment.,Miserable yet?
"He's polite, well-adjusted and a straight-A student.",Which means he doesn't need you. So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect is still in the cocoon stage?
I'm making him dinner.,You don't make an 11-year-old dinner. You give him a jar of peanut butter.
"It'll be fine. I could give this kid a quinoa salad, and he would eat it just to be nice.","'Cause he's a gutless plaCater, just like his dad."
He's nice.,This is a terrible idea.
Because we like each other?,"Yes. 'Cause of the statement ""we like each other."" You've known him 25 minutes. All you know about him is that he'd lie about a quinoa salad, whatEver the hell that is."
"Lyme disease could cause paralysis. If he was hunting, he'd be exposed to ticks.",No target rash or cardiac involvement. Roomies with benefits keeping you up?
Cribbage. I played with Park's Popo.,Is that two separate Events?
Sensory involvement rules out ALS.,"Okay, yeah. Now this is interesting. We'll get back to the Patient in a second. Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except! you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks. You don't feel guilty about getting Park thrown out of her home. You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over. My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires."
"Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms, meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark of botulism.",So it was something he ate. How innocuous. You've overcome your bias by rEversing it. The only pRoblem is that being in love with a Patient is just as judgmental as being in hate. We didn't find any contaminatedï¿½
The antitoxin could cause anaphylaxis. We need to test first to confirm.,"As if to prove my point, last time you said there wasn't enough time to test prior to a more dangerous treatment."
"It's a different situation, different symptom, different diagnosis.",Different emotion. Give him the antitoxin.
"I could give you crap for making me wait 11 years, but instead I'm going to thank you for not making me wait another 11.",Every little girl wants a pony till they have to clean up after it.
You think I'm going to quit on this? On an 11-year-old?,The only relationship you haven't quit on has been with me.
"Hmm. A needy, truculent narcissist. I think it's been perfect training for parenthood.","That's not Even close. This is the rest of your life. You screw this up, you don't get to run away. You get to ruin both your lives. This is a bigger responsibility than any you've Ever taken on and screwed up."
"He's completely paralyzed, and he tested negative for botulism.",I am now accepting long shots.
"The test for Prions is a brain biopsy. Given his history, there's got to be brain swelling. We can't risk drilling into his skull.",Pretty sure we can.
We also could keep talking until we can find an answer we all can agree on.,"All of us? Those who love him, those who hate him, those who don't give a crap about him or youï¿½"
Or I could just discuss it on my own with Foreman.,He's not your friend.
I get it. He's a Patient. I'm notï¿½,He nEver had your back. He didn't insist that I apologize to you. He asked me to take you off the case. Biopsy his brain.
"Take me off the case. I've obviously completely lost my objectivity. I'm not helping, I'm not Even neutral.",Agreed. So why shouldn't I take you off all my cases?
Because you were right. I hate bullies.,You work for me.
You're not a bully.,"Pretty sure I am, dickwad."
"I've known a lot of bullies ï¿½ people who didn't like me because I'm short, people who didn't like me because I'm Jewishï¿½","Yeah, I get it. There's a long list of reasons not to like you."
"You relentlessly mock, but it's not for self-aggrandizement. It's because ideas are bigger than feelings. At least that's what I choose to beliEve. I also thought you had the side effect of desensitizing me.","You little Hebe. Here's some ideas for you. You screwed up. You kept on screwing up. Everything you said is true, except! it doesn't mean you walk away. You just learn to trust nothing. Everything you think you feel, Everything you think you know. Question Every call, play through Every whistle."
I just had a light bulb. Maybe.,You can trust light bulbs.
"Stop. It's not prions. Epstein-Barr gave him mono. It also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome. The plasmapheresis played through the whistle. We gave it to him for MPA, but when he got worse, we took him off. When he got better, we thought it was the antitoxin. But it was actually the plasmapheresis still working. We had the right treatment, just the wrong diagnosis.",It was my metaphor that solved the case. Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine. Nice save. Didn't quite make up for being a siEve the rest of the game.
It was my metaphor that solved the case. Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine. Nice save. Didn't quite make up for being a siEve the rest of the game.,Ex-girlfriend's baby again?
His mother is moving to Costa Rica. He asked if he could move in with me. And I said yes.,"Well, it's only six or sEven years. Unless he can't get into college, in which case, it's more a matter of your life expectancy."
"I said yes, knowing I'm not remotely ready for that, knowing he's not ready to be separated from his mother. This isn't the act of a mature, rational adult. I-I can't do this, House. You were right.",I have an idea! that can make this entire pRoblem go away.
"Yes, I really want to hear your clEver late-term abortion joke. You were right about Everything. This is life. It's real. It doesn't just go away.",None of that is true.

I'll break your face.,This is the talent portion of the interview.
Okay. You like cards. But you can juggle. I fail to see how this would be of benefit to you.,What if I'm busy? Have you got anything else?
CT showed no clots or malformations. Park and Taub ruled out lymphocytosis and diabetes.,"Well, since you have nothing of relevance to report, I assume that you're here to toss your panties in the ring."

You don't have sex with your cat or Teddy bear.,"If you did, you'd pRobably talk to them more. Guy loves an imaginary being who's nEver going to respond to him. He's no crazier than millions of churchgoers."
It's sad.,You do understand the irony here? Every person in this room has a sex doll. At least the Patient has the stones to be honest about it.
"Ooh, a metaphor. What you didn't foresee is that is that I actually do have a sex doll.","Your doll is your kids. Yours is your parents, yours is your charity. All excuses for not being in a relationship."
My dating is getting in the way of my dating?,"You don't go looking for the right person. You just shack up with whoEver's in the room, and then you get surprised and/or divorced when it doesn't work out. I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet."
"You don't go looking for the right person. You just shack up with whoEver's in the room, and then you get surprised and/or divorced when it doesn't work out. I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet.",You'll bail.
He's right. The obvious solution is for me to hand my kids over to your parents.,Can we stop trying to argue the premise and move onto figuring out why it is that you're all social morons?
"You do understand the irony here. You mocking us for avoiding relationships, but you can't handle losing your ""doll."" You're spending all this time and energy interviewing for a new one.",You're right. That is stupid.

We can't just destroy the Patient's property. That thing cost 7 grand.,"Exactly. Ask him for consent. If he says yes, then we get to go hunting bacteria. If he says no, there's no need because he's crazy, and we need a different theory. See ya. Gotta go build a temple."

Nope.,Oh! How rude of me not to situate you. I'm doing Emily a favor. We're going to track her fiancï¿½ until Dominika can seduce and expose him as the lying cheater I need him to be.

"Hepatic fibrosis. If it damaged his platelets, it'd explain the bleeding.",Unexpected. I actually thought you might agree with my theory. Because that would mean nothing's your fault.

I nEver remember my dreams.,But you're certain that they're insignificant. Defensively so.
I was defending science.,You were defensively defending science.
Or an upper respiratory infection.,"Okay, Chase and Park, start IV antibiotics for pneumonia. Taub and Adams, go check the home for toxins."
Could I go with Taub? It was my idea.,"Right! 'cause for a moment there, I thought you were uncomfortable around Chase because you'd had a nocturnal Australian. You can go with whoEver you want. But all of you, read all of these files."
No.,I had a dream.
House! we can talk later.,"Relax, I'm a doctor. Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me."
Later.,I had sex with Dominika.
In a dream?,"It wasn't literally sex. Technically, it was flossing. You know, teeth, testicles. I think the symbolism is pretty clear."
"He's stable, but we've obviously got a second symptom.","Yeah, yeah, yeah, kid in V-tach. Tell me about the luau in his bedroom."

Hmm?,Have you Ever shot anyone?
"Yeah, that's the issue, not that we have no rational explanation for how the Patient spoke a language he's nEver Even heard.","I've got one. Dang tong lee twah. It means ""you're a bunch of pathetic idiots"" in Hmong. Or it doesn't. But you wouldn't know because none of you speak Hmong. Kid, on the other hand, is presumably fluent in gibberish."
The grandfather speaks Hmong. He translated.,"He heard what he wanted to hear, 'cause if his grandson really is possessed, that means his son really is possessed, which is a giant step up from being a sledgehammering psychopath."
"Scleroderma, advanced to the point that it's affecting his brain?",Interesting.
So we should start treatingï¿½,"Interesting that you keep falling for it when I say ""interesting.""ï¿½ The scleroderma part was idiotic ï¿½ we'd have seen skin involvement. The interesting part is that you and Park agree, but you're not able to look at each other."

"He had the dream, and then he had the bruising.","More likely ï¿½ and by ""likely,""ï¿½ I mean ""rationally""ï¿½ ï¿½ it's the other way around. His brain felt the pain in his neck and created the dream to explain it."
Is it really preposterous that dreams can have physical Manifestations?,"Well, short answer isï¿½"
Thoughts during sleep can and do cause physical changes.,"Is that right, Dr. Park? Did you wake up this morning experiencing physical changes? It's medically relevant."
Her dream doesn't mean anything. Can we start acting like it doesn't mean anything?,"Sure. We could also start acting like walls don't mean anything, but then we'd hurt our noses. You've been taking the high road. You haven't been teasing in an obviously teasable situation because you know it does mean something. She hates the dream because it makes her feel vulnerable. You love the dream because it makes you feel superior. The poor lass who can't help but fall sway to your charms, and you're bestowing upon her the gift of illusory irrelevance."
"I refuse to divulge my dreams about girl-on-girl loofa action. The bruising could indiCate anemia, a vitamin C deficiency, or Even leukemia.",That is so weird that you and I had the same dream. I assume yours also ends with me aParkeving ecstasy while simultaneously placing third in the New York City marathon.
Third?,"I'm a realist. Liver failure can cause gibberish from encephalopathy, constipation, bruising, and breathing pRoblems."
Hepatic fibrosis could hit someone his age.,So let's hit his liver. Get a biopsy.
He was levitating.,Cool. So the one thing we know for sure is he was not levitating.
"Yes, but then I would have come into the room and reported that the Patient was weirdly arParkng his back off the bed. It was his whole body.

The kid's not a magician.,"Of course not. He's the lovely assistant. 'Cause grandpa pig sticker is waving the wand. Middling with! is Chase trying to avoid Taub, or is he trying to prove that he's not avoiding Park?"
Except he wasn't!,"Tetanus wouldn't cause that kind of breathing difficulty. And ending with! if Chase is trying not to avoid Park, why is he doing this today and not yesterday?"
"But hypocalcemia could, and the enema we administered to cure his constipation had a high phosphorous load, which could make him transiently hypocalcemic.","It's a long shot, but at least it has the benefit of being rational. Go pump up his electrolytes and start beta-blockers. And good news for Park: I think Chase had a sex dream about you."
"Why not? As long as he doesn't feed the kid anything or put anything on his skin that we haven't verified is harmless, what's the pRoblem?","I agree. And since we're establishing a new policy of ""What the hell, we'll try anything,""ï¿½ I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance while singing Waka Waka."
As long as you get the mom and Shakira to consent. It's no different than having a priest or rabbi lead a prayer vigil. The mom is scared and confused and desperate for anything that'll give her hope.,"True. But in the long run, I think you'll be happier having our Lawyer declare her unfit.

"Her kid levitated. That happens to my girl, I'm expanding my diagnostic horizons.","All the more reason why we should shut down. We cure this kid now, crazy grandpa and his magic beads get all the credit."
And since when do you care about credit?,"Since when do I care about this kid? All I care about is sending mommy out into the world having faith in faith. Kid's better off dead. As soon as she's done appeasing the gods, let's talk."
Which means he needs a coronary bypass.,It can't be Kawasaki. Echo would have shown it. But a patent ductus arteriosisï¿½
"It can't be a PDA. He's not an infant, nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.","Maybe he has. Maybe he had an infected ductus, which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics."
So no evidence is evidence of evidence?,"I'm just saying, it's consistent."
It's a billion-to-one.,Which means there's sEven people in the world who fit the diagnosis.
I thought we were looking for 100.,"Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought. With idiot doctors like youï¿½"
"You're wrong. But the treatment's just ibuprofen. Closes the malformed duct. Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better","No, worst-case scenario is you piss me offï¿½"
You're not gonna let us save an eight-year-old because one more person might embrace religion?,"Does anyone here think my diagnosis is right? Well, then I have decided for today only, to respect your opinions. We will proceed according to your diagnosis and nothing else. That's an order. Good luck."
Dinner's almost ready.,"I think I'll stick with the fluids tonight, thanks."
Why are you sulking?,I'm not sulking.
"Ohhh, my mistake. Mmm.","Either religion is killing a kid, or I am. What are you doing?"
"Comforting my husband after a bad day. If this is not what you want, I go back to making dinner.",I'm not gonna answer that.
"Oh, smart Man. This is killing mood. U.S. citizenship!",I'll get it.
"This is Mrs. House, please give good news, so my husband and I can go back to sex. Budmo! Is fantastic! How Many notices you send me? O""ï¿½okay, I""ï¿½I""ï¿½I! I""ï¿½I come pick up naturalization certifiCate. Thank you for calling.",I'm sorry.
Just testing my theory.,Adams defied me. There's one more zealot in the world. And Dominika moved out. She was fun. She was hot. She fixed my blender. That is not a metaphor. You know any good fake divorce Lawyers? I am surprisingly depressed by this.
I have cancer.,You were a little short with me the other day. You do need an excuse. Cancer may be overplaying it.
"Oh, Em. Emily. Honey? Help me!","Is that our precious little bundle of tumor? They grow up so fast, don't they?"
How did you know I was here?,How do you think?
Foreman.,"Actually, that would have been easier. No, I followed you."
It didn't occur to you that that might mean I don't want you involved in my cancer treatment?,I'm not here as a doctor. I'm here as a towering pillar of strength.
Be a pillar in the Parking lot.,"No. How Many times have I told you I wanted to be alone and you've made yourself a pain in the ass? I owe you. My word, not a word."
What ï¿½ what are you doing?,"My best friend has cancer. Cut me some slack. Also, spring break. I'm on vacation. Although looking at you now, I can tell the wet t-shirt contest is pRobably gonna suck."
"Hey, you need to talk to your friend. He's embarrassing himself. A doctor should be able to handle his own illness with a little bit more dignity.",I agree with Wilson.
My recommended treatment is sound.,"No, I meant about the ball-less part. Explains the office."
We've spent a lot of time in hospitals.,B-9.
Hit. And I hate you. Ugh. I'm done.,I sunk your battleship?
No. But I think I'm gonna puke.,"Good. Now that you're sufficiently buzzed, what was the reason behind you freaking out on Kondo? Are you scared? In denial?"
"I know you get confused any time someone thinks that you're wrong, but it's not considered freaking out for a Patient to ask for a second opinion.","Okay, well, here it is. Kondo is right. You should be in radiology right now."
Well done. You've kept your word for almost two hours.,"Every day you wait, our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest. If you want to live, stop screwing around and do something about it."
Go away. I have a headache.,"We don't have to have sex. Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk. Me first. You don't want a second opinion. You're already on your fifth. You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County, Foster at Johns Hopkins. And Every one of them has given you the same advice. You're nuts. You don't just want chemo. You want a dose so high, there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright. Question is, why didn't you tell me? Because you knew I'd stop you. Which means you've already found someone insane enough or desperate enough to give you what amounts to a death dose of chemicals. But who would be that stupid? I'm thinking that the who, is you."

No. No! Stop. I'm still healthy. Why not go the extreme route now when there's a better chance of surviving it?,"Statistically, this treatment has about the same chance of killing you as the thymoma does. But a hell of a lot faster."
I am not going to die slowly in a hospital bed under fluorescent lighting with people stopping by to gawk and lie about how I look. Even a small chance of that happening is too big a chance for me.,You're an idiot. And the odds say you're gonna die.
You're an idiot. And the odds say you're gonna die.,We'll do it at my place.
She needs an ultrasound guided renal biopsy to check the damage. Hopefully it's rEversible.,To stupidity.
To stupidity.,"Mm, not quite done. To muscle aches, spasms. To your joints feeling like they're being ripped out and replaced with shards of broken glass."
Should I be writing any of this down?,"Your stomach fills with bile. When you vomit, it feels like someone's forcing a white-hot hammer down your esophagus, tearing your flesh. Blood's dripping down the back of your throat, choking and gagging you with the slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies."
I am an Oncologist. I knowï¿½,"If you did, we wouldn't be sitting here. Day two: Your white blood cells are gone, opening up your system to attack. Your temperature skyrockets. One second, your skin feels like it's on fire. The next second, it's entombed in ice. Every pain sensor in your body is firing at the same time until agony isn't Even a word or a concept ï¿½ it's your only reality. You hallucinate. You dream of death. And then the race begins. Can your body claw its way back in time before the hostile organisms and parasites claim you perManently? Win, you live. Lose, you die. Now, what are we doing here, Wilson?"
It's definitely not her kidneys.,Promise this'll taste just as good coming up as it did going down.
"If things go wrong, I just want you to knowï¿½","If you're gonna say that you've always been secretly gay for me, Everyone always just kind of assumed it."
"I just want you to know! that I appreciate the risk you're taking! Pumping a huMan being full of lethal chemicals in your living room. If I die, it pRobably won't go over well with your pRobation Officer.",That's not gonna be an issue.
I'm glad at least one of us is confident.,Not me. I've already identified a couple of spots to dump your body if this goes south.
I've always enjoyed Trinity Park.,It does have a nice access to the lake.
It does have a nice access to the lake.,Muscle spasms already?
No. It's nothing really.,Good news. Takes most people two bags to get to that stage. You're way ahead of schedule.
You'll think it's stupid.,That hasn't stopped you before.
"I just always thought, when I got old or sick, I'd have a wife or kids to look after me.","And in this scenario, are your loving wife and kids holding the life support cord, or are they thumbing through your will? I'm in it, right?"
Mm.,You have Everything you need right here. We both do.
You have Everything you need right here. We both do.,Painkiller. Industrial strength. LEvel: Awesome.
Painkiller. Industrial strength. LEvel: Awesome.,We're on vacation.
I don't know. I shouldn't have done this. Am I dead?,"Not yet. It just feels that way. Are you okay? I mean, apart from the pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?"
You lied. Doesn't taste better coming back up.,Here's another one. You look good.
What's the white blood cell count?,"It's down to 1,000, still dropping."
I need more morphine.,We're out. You've been using my personal supply of painkillers for the last eight hours.
You have ï¿½ you have enough for both of us?,I've got enough stashed around here for a minyan.
Mm.,Just remember they're a gift. So it's rude to keep throwing them up. Found that out with those candlesticks you got me.
No. We can't protect her from Everything. I assume you'll need a lumbar puncture to confirm.,You lost a contact?
Going to the little boy's room.,They're called adult diapers for a reason. Use it.
"I did, and if you think I'm gonna let you change meï¿½",It's okay. I'm a doctor.
It's pathetic. I'm pathetic. An oncologist with cancer. Of all the things that could be killing me! It's like the universe is giving me the big middle finger.,The universe doesn't careï¿½
"Why me? I'm always telling my Patients not to torture themselves, because there's no answer.",Sound advice.
"It's cruel advice. They were just trying to make sense of what was happening to them, and I'm there telling them not to bother? I should have spent my life being more like you. Should have been a Manipulative, self-centered, narcissistic ass, who brought misery to Everything and Everyone in his life.",You'd still have cancer.

No.,I don't have the equipment or the meds to handle this.
No. Win or lose. Win or lose. That was the deal.,"That was the deal when there was an ""or"". You can't win this."
"No. No. I'd rather die here. Not in an ambulance. Not in a hospital. Please, you can't do that to me. I can't ï¿½ House! Please. Promise me that you won't do that to me. Promise me.","Okay, I promise."
Wow. You ï¿½ you really look like crap.,Been fighting a cold lately. SEven to ten days for the swelling to go down. Then we rescan and schedule the surgery.
"I seem to recall, I said some things to youï¿½",You talked a lot. I stopped listening after you confessed your fear of dolphins. Can we just tone down the broMance a few notches? My leg is killing me.
I thought you said you had plenty of Vicodin.,Everybody lies.
"So the way I felt, you feel that, what, most of the time? It really does suck being you, doesn't it?",At least I don't have cancer.
"Yes, it's mine. And yes, I know that I can't drive stick. And no, I don't care that I Parked in a handicapped spot.","""Staring death in the face has changed my life."" What a clichï¿½."
"The clichï¿½ is to lead a more meaningful life. I've taken a holy vow to lead a less meaningful one. I've spent my life caring, giving, and searParkng for the profound. Now it's time for selfishness, indifference, and embracing the shallow.",Your scan's in three days. Tell me this isn't just you killing time until you find out if your cancer's gonna kill it for you.
"I just paid $75,000 for a ridiculously impractical car, the depth of shallowness. And tomorrow, I'm driving it to ClEveland to meet my boyhood crush.",The years have not been kind to David Cassidy.
"Julie Christie. Dr. Zhivago, Shampoo. I was precocious. She's opening some kind of charity animal clinic or something. I'm neglecting my Patients to fulfill a silly fantasy.

How's Wilson doing?,"Wilson's scan is at the end of the week. If his kick-ass chemo shrunk the tumor to an operable size, he'll live. If it didn't, he'll die."
That must be very hard. Is there anything we can do?,"Other than the prayer circle, what is there?"
"Thought we'd make it a road trip. '80s music, junk food, beer.",I have a dental appointment. That I'm going to make now.
Ah. I'll let you drive.,Not worth listening to you whine about your feelings and fears for three days.
It's not gonna happen. I've taken a vow.,"People don't change. You are a person, ergo, pass."
But we found enough of this! !to reanimate the entire morgue. He's jacked on caffeine.,Stimulant psychosis. How Many times do I have to solve this case?
What?,"I'm""ï¿½I'm impressed. Not by that. But by your real effort to maintain the facade. It's been almost an hour, and there's been no mention of the elephant in the car."
"Well, I declined the elephant option.","Uh-huh. In three days, you're gonna find out if you live or die. You don't want to talk about it."
"No, but obviously you do.","So, we're gonna talk about it, but because I want to."
"I am neither talking about it, nor talking about not talking about it.","You are hard-wired to talk about it. It's how you cope, it's who you are."
"Yeah, well, from now on, I'm not me. I'm! I'm! Kyle Calloway.",I thought your porn name was Rusty Packard.
"Kyle is roguish, carefree, and shares no qualities with Wilson.",Can Kyle drive stick?
"Home of the Big One""ï¿½. House and Wilson are sitting at a table, looking at the menu.]","If we had a phone, we could've found somewhere a little less charming."
"If we had a phone, you'd be making calls, downloading porn, and playing Angry Birds. This trip is about me, and I like this place.","This is not about you not wanting me to have a phone. You're weak. You knew that you'd backslide and spend your time talking to teary ex-wives and your parents, trying to make them feel better about you being sick. Bacon burger with fries looks awful.

"I'm hungry. And an iced tea, please.",This place doesn't take credit cards.
"Uh, no. Not fine. We need to talkï¿½","Come on, you got this! You got this! Come on!"

15 seconds!,"Now, don't chew, just swallow. Just muscle it down!"

Ah!,Must be nice to be puking for the old-fashioned reasons.
I want a threesome.,Shouldn't we try a twosome first?
Two women.,Oh.

This thing is peeling.,"Well, that is the cost of cowardice. Should've gone for the real thing."
I feel like I'm cheating.,"A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer, and B, it's Wednesday afternoon. Pickings are slim, and more importantly, sober. The cancer cut is the surest way to the pity pooty party. One down, one to go."

She's empathetic.,Gave me a cancer rate.
No. I have nEver paid for sex in my life.,"You still haven't. It's my treat. It's either that, or you find two very open-minded women to fall in love with you in the next hour."
Bartender seems nice.,Seems female.
Want something to eat?,My friend is dying of cancer.
"Oh, you poor thing. It took my mother two years ago. But you can't give up hope.","He's pretty much resigned. Just wants to go out with a bang. And another pun, what time do you get off?"

I'm not doing any more chemo.,Good plan. You'll be dead in five months.
We went for a cure. It didn't work. I've thought about this a lot. Five more months on this earth is reasonable. A year in the hospital in excruciating pain is! not.,"With two weeks on, two weeks off of chemo, you'll have way more than a year, maybe two or three."

Head CT is clean.,How can we turn Wilson from a terminal idiot into an interminable pain in the ass?
But not his bloody nose.,My best friend is trying to kill himself.
He just wants to die with a little dignity.,There's no such thing.
"It's not your choice, House. Your only choice here is between acceptance and misery.",It's a midline granuloma. Get your Patient a PET scan.
Not according to his brain. His temporal lobe is completely lit up. Auditory portion. He's hearing something.,Foreman's trying to date me. I assume that's because you called him.
"No, I ï¿½ did you! put something in my coffee?",You know how you can be there for me five months from now? Don't be dead five months from now.
"Hey, Wilsï¿½ seriously?",Just a little picker-downer. I assume this unwanted interruption means you're looking for me to discuss the latest dEvelopment in the case I don't want to discuss.
He's at the right age for the onset of sParkzophrenia.,Yeah. You really need me. Ultrasound his abdomen to check for sParkzophrenia.

"What ï¿½ I don't ï¿½ I wasn't dead, I was unconscious.","No dreams, no thoughts. You experienced nothing. Now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part. Just nothing times infinity."
You didn't just prove death is nothing. You proved Propofol is.,"You're saying the end is not the end? I was expecting ""nothing is better than something lousy,"" but not ""the angels are waiting for me."""
I'm not having this conversation.,Why? 'Cause it doesn't make sense?
"Because I'm not gonna change your mind, and I don't care. More importantly, you're not gonna change mine.",There is no heaven. There is no hell. Your soul is not gonna float out of your body and join some great unifying energy force. The fact that you're dying is not gonna change that.
"Don't know, because I don't know why it happened.",Hey. Saved us a table.
There are no tables.,"I recently hacked into your old files. Found a six-year-old boy with bilateral retinoblastoma.

It's Michael now.,"Oh, yeah. This is our table."
Oh!,He's going to be a doctor instead of being dead.
"Dr. House told me all about your situation. That's why I came. There's just so much good that you can do, Even in a small amount of time.",I wonder! Hey! Is there anybody else here who's alive today because of Dr. Wilson?
"Squamous cell lung cancer. 12 years in remission. I was able to walk my daughter down the aisle last May. Thank you, Dr. Wilson.",I did the math. 74 Parkldren are alive today because of you. 14 grandParkldren.
Was anybody in this room really a Patient of mine?,"They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing ""O"" somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives."
"They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing ""O"" somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives.",Its actually more impressive that they're too busy to be here.
House.,Your shoes are wet.
Glad to see your emotional turmoil hasn't dulled your powers of observation. I know you're responsible.,"No, you don't. 'Cause I didn't do it. WhatEver it is.

Friends or friend?,"Hi, this is Greg House. Again. Third message, hopefully indicating how much I want you to call me back. I'd say that your son is dying to increase the urgency, but you pRobably already know that.

"Friends respect each other's decisions, Even if they don't agree with them. It's called loyalty.",Loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.
"But you do want to. You may have rationalized it a hundred different ways, but the fact is, you fired me so that I'd be forced to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted to do.

Are you c-conning me? You're conning me.,"Whaï¿½ just because you folded, that means it must be some evil plan?"
"Well, that's usually how it works with you. You drown me in nostalgia so I'll think about our friendship and feel some kind of loyalty and agree to more chemo!","That was real nostalgia. It was real emotion, a real decision."
A decision that I just made for you!,"I need you, okay? I want you to be around as long as possible. 'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you."

"Of course, I don't wanna die!","Well, then fight."
I did! I tried.,One time.
"House, get out of my car.",You don't have to just accept this.
"Yes, I do have to accept this. I have five months to live, and you're making me go through this ALONE! I'm pissed because I'm dying, and it's not fair. And I need! I need a friend. I need to know that you're there. I needï¿½I need you to tell me that my life! was worthwhile, and I! I need you to tell me that you love me.",No. I'm not gonna tell you that unless you fight.

"You think actually showing up for work is enough to make up for ruining an MRI, endangering the Patient, injuring us?","I got an airtight alibi, that I'm working on."
This isn't about the damage. You're back because something's going on with Wilson.,I'm done with Wilson.
You can't just abandon him.,It's in his hands now. Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?
Enough to know it wasn't a migraine. And the Patient mistook me for Adams.,Come with me.
Come with me.,Hey.
Hey.,So what do you think's gonna happen when I stick a needle into his eardrum?
You quizzing us?,"Oh, this is a good quiz."
He'll scream in pain.,"Don't listen to her. Very small needle, very steady hand."
Ah!,"Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?"
Air.,"Boy, that air sure is red. Persistent stapedial artery. It should disappear in the embryonic stage, but just like his dead brother, he really can't let go. An artery's been pressing against the temporal lobe of his brain, right above the ear canal. It explains the voices, the dizziness, Everything. Now you guys can explain how we're gonna make him better."
You're being an ass.,I just cured a Patient. How 'bout you?
You can't just give up on Wilson. You know he needs you. You know he's making an impossible choice. He just doesn't want to live in pain.,"Life is pain! I wake up Every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how Many times I wanted to just give up? How Many times I thought about ending it?"
"Life is pain! I wake up Every morning, I'm in pain. I go to work in pain. You know how Many times I wanted to just give up? How Many times I thought about ending it?",You here to yell at me or give me hockey tickets?
Where are you going?,You can't wait to die?
You can't wait to die?,"Here, let me help you."
House!,See? You wanna live!
He did something stupid. He's not gonna do it again.,You're resisting me because it's our huMan responsibility to stay alive!
"Did you throw it out? If I agree to get the surgery, can you bring that picture back?",Not home.
I'm ready to start the next round of chemo.,Why?
Because you need me and! I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.,"No. You're the only one I listen to. The last couple of days, I didn't, and I almost killed my Patient. So I think it's time for me to accept that! you're just smarter than I am."
Are you really okay that there's only five months left?,No. But it's better than nothing.
Um! How do we start?,"I'm not gonna say ""I love you."""
"And this is the peak. Almost 8,000 feet.",You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little since the last time we went hiking.
"This is Matt Johnson, the hospital Lawyer.",Yes. I have decided not to proceed with the sexual harassment case.
"Are these yours? The plumber retriEved them from the hospital outflow pipe. They caused a sewage backup that ruined the MRI, and they have your name on them.",Gregory Danger House. It's! a very common name.
These apparently have your fingerprints on them also.,Why don't you tell me how Many hours of picking up trash you want me to do.
You have to report to Mercer County Jail on Monday to serve out the rest of your sentence.,And that's! that's how long?
I'm sorry.,How long?
Six months.,Hey.
Don't bother. He's dead.,You're dead too.
You might want to get up and start heading for the exit signs.,"For all I know, I already am up. More interesting question is why would I hallucinate an ex-employee who I last saw with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, as opposed to someone more! busty? Care to explain why you're here?"
I was in a car accident last month.,I won a swimming trophy in high school. Your turn.
I-I ran out of pain medication. I got an orbital fracture. It's just taking ages to heal.,Take off your shirt.
My eye's up here.,"Orbital fracture means your face went into the windshield, which means your chest went into the steering wheel. Painkillers can suppress heart rate, so unless you want me to kill you, take off your shirt, let me do a heart exam."
],I also wanted to see the ring of burns around your collarbone.
How'd you know?,"The codeine allergy you told the nurse about. That's shorthand for ""give me the strong stuff,"" which matches your seen-better-days-because-my-life-fell-apart suit. The two old burns on your fingers mean you tend to nod off with a cigarette in your hand. No reason you shouldn't do that with one in your mouth. May all your doctors be stupid. Hold on a second. That bruising around your belly button. Well, you might get some fun drugs out of this after all."

That bruising around your belly button. Well, you might get some fun drugs out of this after all.","Cullen's sign. But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood. Now, I know what you're thinking. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis. But I also know what I'm thinking. Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum."
You ran tests yourself?,"I saw the chance to help someone in need, and I instinctively ï¿½ Oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct."
Wilson is dying. Your parole Officer is pRobably on his way here right now. How are you possibly in a good mood?,Did you nEver see Dead Poets Society? Carpe diem.
"Blah. Blah, blah.",Nobody cares about the medicine. It was a perforated ulcer. Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.
You didn't answer the team's question.,"Which is weird, because normally, when I talk to my own employees, I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector."
You were looking at six months of prison instead of five months of Wilson. Why happy?,Obviously I had a plan.
"Obviously, obviously you had a plan. The more interesting question is why you didn't tell the team. I think it's because part of you knew from the start that the plan wouldn't work.",I need a meeting.
I'm busy. Call my office.,Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.
Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.,"I need a meeting. Thanks for fitting me in. My team has eight urgent, life-or-death cases that they've been waiting for me to accept or reject."
When is that not true?,"Well, right now, for one. But tell my parole board that I'm taking all eight! that no one else can crack them; that you need me here for the next five months or eight people will die."
You're asking me to perjure myself.,"It's a tiny, white lie. No offense. Especially since, from what I hear, nothing black is tiny. Except your penis, I guess. You really think I wanted to cave in that ceiling? It was a prank that went wrong. Dock my pay, sue meï¿½"
Felony vandalism should have added another year or two to your sentence. It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.,"I will go to jail, Eventually. I will pay the price. I just rather that Wilson didn't. Come on, be a friend."
"""Be a friend""?","How Many fingers am I holding up? Of course you know it's three, because you know Everything I know. Everything my smack-addled brain can remember, including that I actually said, ""be a friend."""
Why do you want to kill yourself?,"Well, here's a reason. I can't Even get stoned without some annoying jerk deciding I need to be deeply analyzed. Isn't this just an incredibly simple calculation? I'm going to jail, losing my job, losing my best friend. Do I need more?"
You think that's the sum total of who you are? A doctor? A friend to Wilson?,I'm also a tremendous baritone. Now go away.
Stop being an idiot.,"Can I have Kutner back, please?"
How much pathetic wallowing do I have to sit through?,How are things in hell? Is the humidity the big issue?
What happened next with the guy's medical case?,Why?
"Exactly. Why am I, meaning you, still obsessing about this case? Obviously we think it's relevant to why we're still sitting on the floor of a burning building.",There was a code.
What are you doing? What did you give him?,Five! four! three! two!
Ahhh! Arg!! Ahhh!,"Naloxone. We should've got suspicious when his visiting cousin signed in as ""Mr. Tar H. Horse."" Heroin caused the respiratory distress. The naloxone turned off the receptors, caused your distress."
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs! It's reality that sucks!,You're saying I'm lying! to my subconscious?
"People do it all the time. And like it or not, you are a person.",He said Every one of those things.
"But not then and not like that. This guy was going nuts from the naloxone. He couldn't be rational if you wanted him to be, which you did. Why?",I compressed the story a littleï¿½
"jttpgyix matters. You nEver talk to Patients for non-diagnostic reasons, but this guy!",Feeling better?
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs.,"You were a stockbroker. Son of a stockbroker. Married, Parkldren."
I was miserable.,"Well, you say you were miserable because you need to rationalize screwing it up."
"Except I didn't. I mean, I-I did. But I'm not miserable. Not anymore. I had a ski injury and painkillers weren't enough, and a friend of mine gave me some heroin. The second it entered my veins, it was like! God had taken over my body. It was like there was no more pain or unhappiness in my life or anybody else's.",But then you lost Everything.
Are you arguing that he's a good role model?,He's happy.
You're stealing this guy's oxygen?,There's oxygen Everywhere.
"You passed on all your cases, reassigned them to other doctors.",They weren't interesting.
They were my reason for getting your sentence delayed!,"Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell the parole board something else. Maybe that I was in the O.R. the entire day the ceiling collapsed, so I couldn't have caused the plumbing pRoblem."
You set me up.,Not really. You were going to basically perjure yourself so that I could delay jail time. Doesn't it make more sense to actually perjure yourself so that I can actually avoid jail time?
Why are you doing this? Why are you risking destroying yourself?,There's no risk. I know you. You'll do the honest thing. You'll lie.
No.,He's happy.
You weren't worried.,Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.
"The plan didn't matter. Your plan to replace that plan didn't matter. Wilson didn't matter. Jail didn't matter. The only thing that mattered, the only thing that Ever mattered, was the puzzle.","I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence, which meant! You're dying."
Because my thumb's a little shaky?,"Plus the thinning in the muscle, plus that speech you gave at Yankee Stadium saying you were the luckiest Man on the face of the earth. Add them up, it means ALS."
Lou Gehrig's disease? You're trapped in your body; you can't move or speak while you just die?,"If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast. You're not symmetrical."
Wait. Now you're standing at the door. What happened in the meantime?,"And lo, there was a miraculous wonder ï¿½ I walked across the room."
"No, you just skipped over a chunk of conversation.","He swore that he would live a better and more selfless life in his remaining time, blah, blah, blah. After two blahs, I'd heard enough. I moved to the door."
"No, you're avoiding it.",Do you smell smoke?
Fair enough.,You're not symmetrical. The veins on your right side are distended.
What does that mean?,There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch. There's something in there.
What?,"Well, I'm not that good a doctor. Good news: your case is fascinating. And good news for you: you're gonna live."
"Well, I'm not that good a doctor. Good news: your case is fascinating. And good news for you: you're gonna live.","You've inhaled a small branch, pRobably while you were realizing that it's all worth it, while you were passed out on a Park bench. Anyone else would have coughed it up, but 'cause you're a junkie, your cough reflex is suppressed."
And it grew?,"Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot. It set off an auto-immune reaction, which ï¿½ I can't help saying this ï¿½ was the root of all your pRoblems."
You're smiling.,"I was, and now I'm not. Because a moment's fun a few days ago does not trump a friend dying."
"Yeah, it does, you idiot. 'Cause after he's dead, you cry for a while, and then you go back to doing what you love.","Every Patient that I've had, 70 years from now, they'll all be as dead as Wilson. Everybody dies. It's meaningless."
"What about God? You were leaving, and then you stopped. Why?","Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I beliEve in God? What, he's calling me home?"
Maybe falling through that floor was a sign. Maybe that the universe hates you. Something. You really don't beliEve? Really? Not in some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner of your mind?,No. Except that some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner is here telling meï¿½
"That's enough. In a burning building, facing imminent death, that's more than enough.",Pascal's wager is facile.
"Saying it's facile is facile. Why is it wrong? Don't be logical, be desperate. You gotta have something to hold on to.",You can't live your life based on something you don't beliEve.
But you can end your life based on something you don't beliEve? What about love? I lived with you for years. I know you beliEve in love.,"Foreman wouldn't help me, which means I need you to take the fall."
"You do remember I'm dying, right?","Which is you will nEver spend a day in jail. Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden. It's tough to do both, but you pull it off."
Your fingerprints are all over those hockey tickets.,I nEver admitted to flushing anything. My prints make sense if I gave those tickets to you as an incentive to stay alive.
"And I was so angry that you didn't respect my dying wishes, I took thousands of dollars of season tickets and flushed them down toilets?",All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.
"Great, what if I do more than that? What if I end up in jail? Or spending my final months in endless hearings?",That is a risk you are willing to take.
I have a reputation. I have a legacy that couldï¿½,Wilson! I don't want to lose this time with you.
Okay.,Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
Wait! Wait.,You want the fries back?
I'm not gonna take the fall.,"Don't do this to me, Wilson. This is our only option."
"Exactly, because you overplayed your hand with Foreman, because you knew you had me as a backstop. Even with me dying, you-you just assumed I'd be here to bail you out.","Since you're here, and you are bailing me out, it seems like a pretty safe assumption."
"Hey! I won't be here soon. If I do this, I'm teaParkng you that your bad behavior will always be rewarded. You need to learnï¿½","How to act when you're gone? 'Cause if that's the lesson, we got a really great opportunity coming up."
"You'll just try to find someone else, and it won't work, and it shouldn't work!",So that's the great wisdom you're imparting? That I'll always be alone?
There's only one person you can count on.,I thought there were two.
Wilson's right. He's always right. He's always been your good side.,I always wondered why I photographed so poorly.
"And because he's always played that role, you've nEver had to dEvelop a conscience of your own.",People don't change. Consciences don't spontaneously dEvelop.
Hold your Parkld.,"This is a reason to die. This is what my life could've been, not what it can be."
"If it could've been, you're capable of it now.",You're married. Cuddy's gone.
We aren't the only two people who could love you.,Why settle so easily? These are just idiotic fantasies!
"Greg, don't.",! at odds with Every logical bone in my body.
Get up. You do not have to die in here!,Is this hell? An eternity of people trying to convince me to live?
Who says I'm here to convince you to live?,You're the last one I thought would hate me.
I don't hate you. I love you.,And yet you think I deserve to die.
But not as a punishment. As a reward. I think! you've suffered enough. You've given enough. I think you deserve a chance to just! give up.,Like Wilson did?
Just let go. Just go to sleep.,I had a chance to avoid this.
"You had Many chances, and you blew them all up.","No, this was different."
"They're all different, but the reasons are all the same. You're arrogant. You're self-destructive. You only care about yourself.",That moment with the Patient! the chunk of the conversation I skipped over! I told him he was dying.
That moment with the Patient! the chunk of the conversation I skipped over! I told him he was dying.,"If it makes you feel any better, at this rate, it'll be fast."
"Let me take the fall. For you, for that prank.",You don't owe me anything.
You tried to save me.,I failed. Motives don't matter. Only actions.
"Trying is an action. Why are you trying to talk me out of this? You just fake the records. You say I came into the clinic last week. I'll tell the cops you treated me like crap, so I stole your tickets and flushed 'em.",Thank you. And you're doing this because you're dying?
I'm doing this because I have nothing left to lose.,"So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone and you didn't care. Now that you're dying, you're willing to help a virtual stranger. Which means you're a better person dying than you Ever were living, and the world is a better place because I didn't save you. Which makes me wonder why I'm about to tell you! you're not symmetrical."
What's your point? That you cared about him more than you cared about yourself? You cared about the puzzle more than you cared about yourself.,"If I kept it to myself, then it would just be a puzzle, but I opened my mouth because I thought it was more."
"You know it's the same, or you wouldn't be bickering with me while the flames lick at your feet. You're afraid of this decision, and you are trying to argue until fate takes it out of your hands. You're taking the cowardly way out. And worse! you're too cowardly to Even admit you're taking the cowardly way out.",You're right. But I can change.
"Phone. A million times he needed me, and the one time that I needed himï¿½ Oh, come on. This is a funeral. Just get it. Well, this is embarrassing. Could've sworn I turned this off. This isn't my phone.",Hi.
How?,I got out of the back of the building.
The bodyï¿½,Just switched the dental records.
You're destroying your entire life. You can't go back from this. You'll go to jail for years. You can nEver be a doctor again.,"I'm dead, Wilson. How do you want to spend your last five months?"
When the cancer starts getting really bad!,Cancer's boring.
Wilson's back. You gonna say ï¿½,He's been gone two months. He can wait till I finish slaying a guy in a skullcap and a pair of tights.
On a video game you stole from the pediatric ward?,"On advice of counsel, I assert my privilege pursuant to the fifth."
When was the last time you talked to him?,"Uh, I think it was after... When did his girlfriend die? He wanted time alone. I considered being a horrendous pain in the ass, but I didn't want to tread on your turf."
We got a case.,I've gotta remember to close the blinds.
We know who she is.,"I dated her. Well, not really dated her. More metaphorically raped her by having a penis. You did too."
Her assistant flipped out. Ripped off her clothes in front of a room full of businessmen.,"Well, either she cracked under the whip, or she started to realize that her evolutionary purpose is to arouse men, not to castrate them. Send her to psyParkatric."
"Anemia, bradycardia, and abdominal pain aren't psyParkatric symptoms.",Then it's the latter. Send her to my apartment.
House has more important things to do.,"Sorry, can't help you. You need a specialist to remove those kind of warts. Preferably one with experience spelunking."
"Sorry, can't help you. You need a specialist to remove those kind of warts. Preferably one with experience spelunking.","Hallucinations, possible memory loss. Tests show anemia, slow heart rate, and a stubborn refusal to shave her pits."
Have you seen Wilson?,"Nope. But I have seen the Patient's frequent flyer balance. Eastern Europe, Asia, third-world countries. Sometimes more than one a day."
You haven't been by his office?,Is Wilson hallucinating ants crawling all over him too? Tox screen's cleaner than the windows she won't do.
"Why is Everyone leaping to conclude a strong career Woman's been made sick by her strong career? It's not B12, it's an insulinoma in her pancreas. It's making her hypoglycemic.",Great. Now Everyone knows.
You knew the Patient had cancer?,"Is that what she said? I thought she said, ""I am suddenly and irrationally defending the Patient's strong career, Even though in reality she's just a glorified grunt, because I'm trying to convince myself that it's okay not to have a life because I don't have a life, because I was tested for Huntington's, and my life span's been cut in half."" Been waiting two months for her to say that."
"Hallucinations, anemia, bradycardia ï¿½",Hyper segmented polys says that Taub's right. Pump her full of B12. See how a strong career Woman's been made sick by her strong career.
"It's okay, B12 deficiency can cause sudden ï¿½ That's not a bowel movement.","My Patient is still fighting in the feminist trenches, but the war is over. Yesterday's sluts are today's empowered women. Today's sluts are celebrities. If that isn't progress ï¿½"
I'm leaving.,"What, are you gonna take another two months? Boy, you're really milking this bereavement thing, aren't you? I mean, good for you. You take all the time you need."
I'm resigning. Maybe moving out of New Jersey. I don't know yet.,Okay. That's an understandable reaction.
It's not a reaction. It's a decision. I'm writing Cuddy my resignation right now. I'm just back for the week to wrap up my clinical and administrative duties.,"You of all people should know, this is bereavement 101. You think that a change of venue ï¿½"
"Well, that spares me decades of psychoanalysis.",I'm not saying you're not in pain.
You're saying my pain's a clichï¿½.,I'm saying that pain fades.
Did yours?,Physical pain is different.
I'd rather have my leg chopped off.,"Well, you don't know that 'cause you haven't felt ï¿½"
"Sorry, Patient's got a rectal bleed.",Busy.
We need you to ï¿½,"Actually, as you can see, I'm not busy. It's just a euphemism for ""get the hell out of here."" This is your grief talking. And, yeah, it is a bit textbook. So before you give away all your possessions to the Salvation Army ï¿½"
"House, this is the kind of case you love. Contradictions piling up left and right.","Two false positive pregnancy tests, bradycardia, lower GI bleed. Go."
Choriocarcinoma ï¿½ would've triggered pregnancy hormones.,Also would have shown on a sonogram.
"Immunoglobulin ""A"" deficiency.",No urinary bleed.
"If she's had beta HCG injections, they can cross-react with...",Keep going.
Keep going.,"You're being an idiot. You're gonna blow up your career. And six months from now, when you've moved on from Amber to burnt sienna, you're gonna be stuck in a mobile oncology truck in Pewaukee, Wisconsin."
I'd need a flow chart to explain all the ways in which that was ridiculously insensitive.,You can't hide from misery.
This isn't your business.,My skull was cracked open trying to save her!
"Uh, we have a Patient.",Who's obviously not going anywhere with a bloody rectum.
"Actually, I'm ï¿½","Actually, he's about to thrust a tantÅ into the belly of his career."
I just need a change of scenery.,Buy a plant.
You could ask House to be a grown-up and respect my decision.,"I respect things that deserve respect. This decision, on the other hand, is a dog wearing a cape!"
Hallucinations. Heart won't respond ï¿½,The Patient tested positive for pregnancy because the Patient is pregnant.
This is Dr. House. He's too brilliant for introductions. False positive.,You're too busy to be running a Day Care Center in your abdomen.
False positive.,Not to mention you should wait till at least 30 to punish that pleasure portal with a sEven-pound tissue expander.
I'm 37. And I thought I wasn't pregnant.,"37? Impressive. Too bad you're not passing on those genes. Does that look false to you? You were looking in the wrong room. It's more common when the egg lands in the oven. Sometimes it winds up in the fallopian tubes. In rare cases, it plummets through the plumbing entirely. It's using her intestine as a blood supply. It caused the rectal bleed, and now... Junior Miss Steinem's junior must be pressing on her vagus nerve, slowing her heart to a crawl. Yank the fetus. She survives the surgery, she'll be fine."
What if she wants to keep the baby?,She doesn't.
"What, we can't take two seconds to discuss this? I mean, fetuses have been transplanted before. Whole uteruses too.",Just terminating the fetus when it's glued to her intestines is high-risk surgery. Saving it is a fantasy. That was at least three seconds.
She's a 37-year-old Woman who deserves ï¿½,"People get what they get. It has nothing to do with what they deserve. And this has nothing to do with her genitalia, and Everything to do with your genetics."
You told me to get tested.,"I didn't know it was gonna color your Every medical opinion, Every personal opinion."
You didn't think a death sentence would ï¿½,"People die! You, Amber, Everyone. Don't act like you just figured that out. I gave you a diagnosis. You don't like it, there are exits on Every floor."
"No, not at all.",Treating professional sports injuries now?
"No, I'm not ï¿½","Familiar with the concept of sarcasm. Don't sweat it, it's new. Have you spoken to Wilson?"
We'll get you an EKG. I'll be right back. You want me to sleep with him to get him to stay?,"I put the bisexual Parkck on that. If you'd like to sit in, so to speak..."
I spoke to him.,What'd you tell him?
I didn't tell him anything. I listened.,So you could feel good about doing nothing. You gotta tell him ï¿½
The two of you used to be together?,She dumped me when I lost the last 85 pounds. Said there was less of me to love.
"Grief means different things to different people. Case in point, means very little to you.","Grief is Newark. Okay, it's there. You can't avoid it. The idea is to hold your nose, hope the traffic's not too bad, and get on to Manhattan as quickly as possible, not to buy property."
You think that's facing up to things?,I'm not the one who's quitting.
'Cause you haven't lost anything.,But you have. He'll listen to you. What did you do when your husband died?
I got a new job and I moved.,See how crappy that worked out?
Bye.,You have to stop Wilson from committing career malpractice.
Talk to him.,I already talked to him twice. He threw me out.
"Mocking him and insulting him, let's see! Yes, technically those are Categories of conversation.",Block his references to other hospitals. Tell him he can't hand off his cases until ï¿½
Talk to him. Deal with his grief. Talk to him about what he's going through.,That's a brilliant idea. I'll take him out for a beer. That'll make up for the fact that Amber's in a pine box. That there's randomness and chaos in the universe.
Tell him you're sorry.,I didn't kill her.
You were drunk and ï¿½,"Yeah, if her daddy hadn't been drunk, she might nEver have been born. So ï¿½"
You called her up in the middle of the night. She was on the bus because of you.,I didn't ask her to come out. I wasn't driving the bus. I wasn't driving the garbage truck that hit the bus. And I did not prescribe her the flu meds that killed her.
"Yes, I know, that's all true. But... You really don't feel any sense of guilt? You want to keep him, he needs to know he's not alone. Just tell him you feel like crap.",It'd be meaningless.
It's for you.,"If I told you that I was sorry, would it change anything?"
I wouldn't beliEve you.,If you beliEved me.
It's hard to imagine such a world.,I'm going home... !until you agree to stay at this hospital.
You can't be s! That's blackmail. And to do your job? Why not hold a gun to your own head?,Your conscience bleeds more freely than my head. Text. Patient's in cardiac arrest. Ouchy.
You'd jeopardize a Patient because of my ï¿½,If it keeps you here. Your friendship matters more to me than this Patient.
I've gotta do what's right for me. You've gotta do what's right for you.,Yeah. But it comes easier for me.
Mind if I come in?,Not at all. You mind if I leave?
I told you not to take that case specifically so you could deal with Wilson.,"And the two ended up dovetailing rather nicely, don't you think?"
Is this how you show your friendship? By bludgeoning him with guilt?,"Because he's my friend, I know what works on him."
"Well, I can't let you walk away from a Patient.",Then fire me.
"You're willing to risk your career, but you're not willing to say you're sorry.",I told him I'm sorry. He didn't beliEve it.
"Well, make him beliEve it.",I don't beliEve it.
It means we were wrong about the MS.,You had my cable disconnected!
"Well, that's quite a leap. Just because I happen to have a 31-person maintenance department, each of whom you've personally abused at some point ï¿½","Why? Did you think I'm okay with letting someone die, but I'm gonna fold if I can't watch celebrity bowling?"
Stop! I'm withholding your salary history from Every hospital in the tri-state area.,"You go, girl."
"It's an abnormal growth of nerves, it could be causing all the Patient's symptoms. We have to open her up again. Get a piece of it.",So what do you want to tell us?
Nothing. Nothing I say is gonna change anything. You guys need to talk.,"Actually, you should read the psych literature. Repression's gaining a lot of fans. What you don't face can't crush you."
Talk to each other.,How you doing? Good?
"Eh, eh, eh, eh. Sit! See, the two of you are friends. Look how you both ï¿½",Think you're an idiot. We both also eat with forks. That doesn't really prove ï¿½
Talk to him! Tell him how you feel about what he's doing.,I told him he's an idiot.
Tell him what you think about him leaving.,I think he's an idiot.
You're an idiot. He's in pain. And your response is just to emotionally blackmail him.,"You told me what your position is on that one. You're against it, right?"
Go to hell.,So much for that theory.
Nobody at this hospital Even liked Amber.,Same time next week?
"I am. Not just 'cause you saved my life. I'm applying for a job at a foundation, running the finance division. And I don't know if I'm gonna get it, but if I don't... There are other foundations.",It's almost 4:00. Soap time. Nurses' remote. Works in the doctors' lounge.
Why do you think Wilson's leaving?,"How Many times do I have to use the word ""idiot""?"
"And that's a good enough answer for you? WhenEver anyone does anything out of the norm, you have to tell them what screwed-up process is really at work in their head. That is why I locked the two of you in a room. So you would say something stupid and insensitive, and maybe with a little bit of truth. But you didn't. So I can only assume that you don't want to know the reason. You're afraid to know. You're not listening to me, are you?",Try it sometime. You'll see why.
Try it sometime. You'll see why.,You look 37.
I am 37.,You looked 27 last week. Unless I blacked out for ten years. Your skin ï¿½
She's got lymphoma. The chemo's pRobably ï¿½,Stop the chemo.
She's getting better. Bradycardia's improving. We didn't need ï¿½,She have bruising?
She was pounding her legs during the hallucinations.,It's not lymphoma.
"Hey, don't ï¿½ no, no, no.","My bad. Thought no meant yes. Those aren't bruises. They're mycobacterial lesions. She has diffuse lepromatous leprosy. Must have caught it on one of her overseas estrogen tours. Chemo wipes out some of the bacteria, she feels a little better. Wipes out most of her immune system, she gets a whole lot worse."
Leprosy? Like where my limbs fall off?,"Actually, this is the flattering one. It's also known as ""pretty leprosy."" It doesn't disfigure, it makes your skin look younger, smoother. Don't let the girls hear. They'll all want to lick your face. Unless you're that kind of feminist. Blast her with antibiotics and prednisone. She'll be fine. Damn, it's after 4:00. I'm late."
"No. I'm not sure I want her to change. She's reasonable. She's just another employer, then I'm just... another employee. In a weird way, I matter.",I like you better now that you're dying.
I was wrong.,You took a shot.
She's going back to work for that idiot. It's pathetic.,You thought something would change?
"She almost died because of that job. Yeah, I! I thought ï¿½",Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes Everything.
Almost dying changes nothing. Dying changes Everything.,"I'm sorry. I know I didn't try to kill her. I know I didn't want her hurt. I know it was a freak accident. But I feel like crap, and she's dead because of me."
I don't blame you. I wanted to. I tried to. I must have reviewed Amber's case file 100 times to find a way. But it wasn't your fault.,"Then we're okay? I mean, I know you're not, but... Maybe I can help."
"Which means arrhythmia, massive pulmonary embolus, or cerebral bleed.",What did Wilson do for me?
Five organ systems hit. Would need five infections for it to somehow slip by screening.,"Oh, sure, he made me laugh on a rainy day, made me see the colors I nEver knew ï¿½"
I guess we could wait till we figure out what's wrong with Frank.,"On the other hand, Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh. And how Many colors are there really? Once you got red, blue, and green ï¿½"
Cancers have names. They have a progression. They affect specific organs. Bone cancer can't turn into liver cancer. Forget cancer.,It's cancer.
It's not cancer.,"You're right, of course. What was I thinking?"
No single type of cancer blew up three organs in the chest while also herniating in the fighter's brain stem.,The fighter's irrelevant.
You don't like coincidences.,"It would be a coincidence if six transplant recipients had nothing else wrong with them ï¿½ like being an idiot, which leads to getting your head knocked off. The others had cancer."
"Four autopsies and about 1,000 lab tests say it's not cancer.","Redo the thousand tests and the four autopsies. Taub and Kutner, check out the donor. Find out which cancer ï¿½"
He didn't die of cancer. His head got chopped off in an industrial accident.,"Find out which cancer would have killed him. Check the home and office for carcinogens, toxins ï¿½"
He's been dead for four years. I assume his home's been rented to someone else by now.,Find out which cancer killed them. Did I forget you? You can check out the Patient's eye.
Find out which cancer killed them. Did I forget you? You can check out the Patient's eye.,Put this on Dr. O'Shea. And some Parkps.
"Forget your wallet, House?",No.
I'll take care of it.,Check.
Are you following me?,Word is you're into monster trucks.
My kids like it.,But not you?
"Predator's okay, but I think the California crusher is overrated. Are you checking me out?",You're astute. No.
How Many pills did you just take?,"Vicodin, opioids, some B12. Need a little kick in the afternoon. You got a pRoblem with that? I think I'm falling in love."
Her right eye's failing.,"No, it's not. Everyone else's transplanted organs were fine. It means her eye is fine."
We need to remove the eye.,It's her only working eye.
"We could remove the other one, but since it's not killing her, I thought this way was less insane.",Do you have some ethical pRoblem with what I'm doing that you could express in a unique way which might actually make me think that I'm wrong Even though I'll nEver admit it?
Yes.,You are funny. The pRoblem's not in her eye. It's in her head. You wanna come over and watch Prescription Passion at my place tonight?
"You know I'm not gay, right?","Neither am I. If you don't want to have sex, that's cool with me."
I'm not coming over to your home.,I'll grow on you.
L... P... E... Do I have to be in the same room as him?,"WhatEver he's got, you've got. Fifth line."
Are you sure?,Pretty sure. Fifth line.
Am I gonna die?,Can we talk about something besides you for a moment? Like maybe the fifth line?
F... E... O... S... P.,Damn.
My eye?,"A moment ago, you thought you were dying. Blind's actually good news. Unfortunately, he's wrong."
You just did the test.,She didn't squint. Which means the eye thinks it's fine.
It was wrong.,"I know. The eye doesn't think. The brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong. Which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye. Which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head. Don't worry. It doesn't hurt."
"I know. The eye doesn't think. The brain thinks, which means if the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong. Which means it's spread to the brain, which means it's too late for us to remove the eye. Which means we're gonna have to remove your whole head. Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.","Hallucination. That's a brain thing, right?"
500 different things can cause hallucination. Doesn't mean it's neurological.,It does if one of the other organ recipients also had a brain issue. Did he just drop his hands?
"No, none of them had brain issues.","If his pupils dilated, if his pupils were fixed, if there was a twitch..."
"He got hit in the head, he died, no mystery. That was your point.","Yesterday. You live, you learn. Who shot this?"
Guy who runs the gym has a camera. Uploads the nasty stuff online.,"Can't see the dead guy's face. I can't see his face. Can't see the twitch, can't see the pupils ï¿½"
I thought I already talked about not judging.,What kind of idiot wears argyle socks with construction boots?
Who is he?,He's apparently a very bad private investigator.
"Uh, why is he pretending to fix the coffee maParkne?","Because I wanted to find out what you guys found out before I find out what he found out. So I can find out if I need a private investigator. So, nu?"
"The kid has a tummy ache. Also, the dead guy was exposed to mercury, mold, and hydrous perchloric acid because their sex pad was next to a garage that was demolished after those toxins were found. Oh, yeah, that will be $2,300.",I'll get you a check.
"No, I don't take checks.",You think I'm gonna stop payment?
Aren't you?,"Of course I am, $2,300 is insane."
"No, actually, that price includes footage of the boxing match from four different angles. 30% of the crowd paid by credit card. I got their names. Four of them had digital cameras, which I composited like NASA did for the pics of Mars. You know, the rovers and all that.",Pupils were dilated.
"But he didn't drop his hands, which means he maintained muscle tensity ï¿½",Say it.
You were right.,"God, that was petty of me."
Does that PI guy mean we don't have to break into people's homes anymore?,It's the whole reason you went to medical school. I'm not gonna take that away from you.
He's better than we are.,And costs more. Gonna biopsy the brain.
No.,Say it.
"You were right, but no.","Temporal lobe controls speech, hearing, memory. She loses those things, she's gonna be a terrific date, but beyond that ï¿½"
"We cut out a piece of it, good chance she's a vegetable. Nothing to hear, nothing to say, nothing to look back on.",You're right. She has so much to live for. Do we have another Patient who's almost finished with all their living?
So it's okay to stab his brain because he's old?,"No, it's okay to stab his brain because he's dead if you don't. Get the widow to say yes."
Clear. Clear. Clear.,Did you get the consent?
No.,Tell Foreman to get it. Old people are scared of black people.
It won't matter. Patient's dead.,Save the brain. Don't need consent for an autopsy.
Save the brain. Don't need consent for an autopsy.,"Well, at best, we're gonna bat one for six on this one."
Thin slices through the parietal and temporal lobes were clean. Occipital and frontotemporal regions were also ï¿½,Brain's clean. Moving on.
Or six things wrong?,"Metabolic diseases specialize. Everything else specializes, but cancer plays the field."
You're back to cancer?,Metastasis is just a fancy word for screws around.
Any type of cancer?,I don't know.
There would be evidence of cancer.,There is. We just haven't found it yet.
You need it to be cancer so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson.,"Give me something else that explains this constellation of Patients, then you can call me an ass."
"Perforated intestine. If this thing started as normal bacteria living in the intestines but got into a blood vessel through a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall, then they would affect Every organ through the blood stream. It screws up Everything. For Everyone.","Okay. It's a long shot. It is possible that I'm an ass. Ironically, we need to do a colonoscopy to confirm."
The anomaly would have to be intermittent or they all would have died within a day.,"She starts getting abdominal pain, shove a tube up her rear before it can get away. And test anyone else with stomach pain."
Everyone else is dead.,Not Everyone. The one thing the donor gave to each of these people is his DNA. Anyone else have his DNA?
You want to do a colonoscopy on a healthy four-year-old?,"She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right, it's not a tummy ache, it's a fatal brain or heart or lung or liver or pancreas ache."
I'm not gonna scare the hell out of the poor kid's mom because of a long shot corollary to a long shot theory.,Fine. Tell her the truth. Then ask if daddy knows who the real daddy is.
We need her to tell us when it hurts. She'll get over it. Your husband might not have...,What if a kid wants ice cream?
The sign outside says 'closed'. Dr. O'Shea's not right for you.,What'd you find out?
Why are you investigating him?,'Cause I need to know if he lends money interest-free. What did you find out?
Not until you learn to read. You're supposed to trust friends.,I don't know the guy. I got no logical reason ï¿½
To be his friend? Have you nEver seen an after-school special? That is part of the pleasure of friendship: trusting without absolute evidence and then being rewarded for that trust.,You're taking pictures of a guy who's having an affair with his own sister. And you're lecturing me about the rewards of trust.
"There are two types of people that hire me. No, actually, there are three types of people that hire me, but the third type's irrelevant to the point I want to make.",Do you have a special rate plan for being a pain in the ass?
One type wants to find out that they're right. One type wants to find out that they're wrong.,Which type am I?
You're the third type.,You lead with the irrelevant types?
You're the type that doesn't care if you're right or wrong because they've hired me to investigate the wrong person.,That's an actual type?
You want me to check out Wilson. You want to find out if he's ï¿½,How do you know about Wilson?
What do I do for a living?,You checking me out? Have I been paying for that?
"So far, you haven't paid for anything. You want to find out he's pining. You want to find out if there's something about him that will tell you he's gonna come back or something you can use to make him come back.",Is there?
"No, no, there's nothing. Sorry. That will be $900.",I gotta go. I'll get you a check.
Colonoscopy was clean.,Then that just leaves cancer.
The fact that the kid's colonoscopy was negative doesn't prove anything.,"Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything. Excellent point."
The opening would have to be open shortly before death.,"Unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death. And that seems like an obstacle."
What if there was a way around that?,Then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.
It's not gonna ï¿½,Do it.
What if it is autoimmune?,What if we don't have conversations we've already had? Four out of the five didn't linger. They got sick and died. We don't have time to dismiss things we've already dismissed.
Nothing fits.,"See, that's an example of a conversation we've already had. She's sick. Something fits."
MS?,"No! Okay, from now on, no one says anything unless no one's said it before."
Where are you going?,You guys start immuno-gels on her CSF to look for hidden protein markers. Then start sequencing her genes. I'm gonna start treatment.
Treatment for what?,Cancer.
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.,It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.
It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.,She's fine. Where's her chart?
You rang emergency to get her chart?,I know. That was bad of me. But I'm pretty sure the chart's supposed to be attached to the bed so that gimp doctors don't have to look all over the place while Patients die. Thank you so much. And some peppermint tea when you get a chance.
You found cancer?,No.
Then you have tests indicating ï¿½,Nope.
Then why should I sign it?,"That's a good question. It deserves a compliCated answer. Placebo effect. People have confidence in doctors. They have confidence in diagnoses, confidence in medicine. Sometimes they get a little better just because they think they will. And that can make us think that the wrong answer is the right answer. Which is very bad."
So you do have proof that it's cancer but you can't tell me because it might affect the way I react to the medicine?,"If that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true?"
I was practically blind before the transplant ï¿½ 20/200 vision.,Didn't you cover all this personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?
You don't care who I used to be?,You're a post-corneal transplant math teacher. I deduced that you were a blind math teacher.
I was an arParktect.,You gave up arParktecture after you could see?
The world was ugly. You think the world would be any different if your leg was fine?,No.
"Think you'd be any different if your leg was fine? I mean, the doctors told me that my life was gonna be so much better once I could see. I would date, I would dance, but, uh, the guys I hated dancing with before I hate dancing with after. My parents were still dead. I was still alone.",You're fun.
You don't seem all that different.,I haven't given up.
"Wilson's got a new job, hasn't started yet, but ï¿½",So who are we following?
See that lady up there?,You point at the target?
"No, I'm following the one halfway in between that point and that point.",Pretty. Who hired you?
No one. I just like her.,You're stalking her?
"No, no, I followed her out of that bookstore back there.","You are stalking her, just not for very long. So what else can you tell me that I might care about?"
He attends this grief counseling thing twice a week where they go around the room and cry about who's dead. Cameron's been to his House sEveral times. They just talk about death and losing loved ones.,"What!? If she turns her head, she's gonna see that we're walking the wrong direction."
"No, no, no, she won't. I'm very nondescript.","Well, I'm not."
"Well, then you stay four feet behind me.",How do you know what they're talking about?
I'm in the same grief counseling group. I recently lost my mother.,You'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.
I didn't lose a kid.,You're a PI who can't lie?
Are you lying?,No.
Yes.,Lesson one: Commit.
More uncomfortable.,She's not your type. Your type is much stupider than her. What did Wilson say about me?
"Oh, you've nEver come up.",In the grief counseling or in the other ï¿½
She's better.,I could tell at once.
Can't beliEve it. It's cancer.,It's not cancer.
It's not cancer.,Labs show that our Patient is healthier. She's gonna get sicker. Then she's gonna die. I brought Thai food.
What did you see in her?,Nothing. It's not cancer. All the tests say it's not cancer. They've always said it's not cancer.
Treatment proves it's cancer.,"Eh, treatment proves it could be cancer. It's not cancer."
This was your diagnosis.,I nEver thought it was cancer.
You treated for cancer.,"I thought that what she had acted like cancer. If it acts like cancer, maybe it'll respond like cancer."
It did. 'Cause it's cancer.,"We have to find something that walks like cancer, talks like cancer, tastes like cancer, but isn't cancer."
"No, we don't. Better is better. Who cares why?",I do. And so does Tetrault.
Who?,The dead tuba player.
Tibalt.,"The point is, he died last, but he died. Which means she's gonna die too."
Tibalt wasn't receiving cancer medication.,There's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.
There's no record of arthritis.,Did you interview all the tuba students?
"If he had joint pain in his hands, he couldn't have played.",Then it wasn't in his hands.
Then why do we care about his students?,One of them is Canadian. Brought him methotrexate so he could hide his arthritis. Already couldn't afford his insurance. And that little piece of business cost me $700. I'm gonna pass it on to the Patient with a steep mark-up.
This makes no sense.,I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. Something's missing.
I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. Something's missing.,"I need an epiphany. What are you billing out at, $300 an hour? Here's four."
There are other oncologists.,"Better oncologists. But I need you. Let me describe the symptoms, pRoblems, issues, and you say whatEver you feel like saying, until something triggers an idea in my head."
That's not the way it works.,"You have a way of thinking about things. It's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear. It complements mine. It drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise ï¿½"
"House, please go away.","Cancer, but not cancer. Responds to cancer treatment, but there's no ï¿½ How are you?"
Don't do this. Please. Please. Don't do this. I'm trying to move on.,"By hanging out with Cameron, talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me. I! I paid a private investigator to spy on you."
You didn't.,"You want to move on from me, you got to deal with me, talk to me."
You had no right ï¿½,"We're not friends anymore. There's no trust to be breached. I can have you followed, I can call you names, tell your secrets. Foreman did a CT. Temporal and frontoparietal regions are normal. Occipital lobe, normal."
"I have the right to walk away from you, House. There's a world beyond you. You need to realize that, and Even if you don't, I'm moving on. The next time you knock, I'm not answering.",Nothing yet. Keep talking.
I'm sorry.,You charge me for listening in on my own conversations?
"Yeah, why wouldn't I?",How Many friends do you have?
17,Seriously? You have a list?
"No, I knew this conversation was really about you, so I just gave you an answer so you could get back to your train of thought.",Well done. I have one. Had one.
"You know, friends are important. You're gonna missï¿½",Shut up. Friends allow you to not sit in a room by yourself. Are you charging me for this?
Are we friends?,No.
Then yes.,Do you wanna be my friend?
No. You scare me a little.,"He thinks if he's not a friend, he can't talk to me. We can talk, we can be two huMan beings talking ï¿½"
I'm with him. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.,"Yes, you did. I was in the middle of a sentence."
"Yes, I did. You're repeating yourself.",I'm grateful. Make your point.
"It's like that ""cancer, but not cancer"" thing you were talking about before. Friends are friends, customers are customers, and Everything else is Everything else. If it's not, nothing's nothing.",And anything can be anything. 10:10. Stop the clock.
What?,The world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.
The world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.,"Cancer, but not cancer. Doesn't make any sense unless... Brain, but not brain. Occipital lobe's normal. But her eyes suck. That lobe should be compensating. Since it's not, that tells me that something's in there that shouldn't be in there. Brain, but not brain."
Why are you in my office?,"To find the anomaly, I need to chop off the top of her head. Pretty sure I need your approval for that."
I'm gonna trust your first instinct.,I'm not usually confused when you say things like that.
"I'm ordering her cancer treatment to be continued. Why does it cost $2,300 to fix a coffee maParkne?","Cancer stem cells are real. They explain Everything. They're like embryonic stem cells. They become whatEver they want. Donor had them, the recipients got them. They floated around, they landed on an organ, got bathed in cytomes and partially differentiated. And the key word there is partially. In the tuba player, they became lung, but not lung. In the tennis player, they became heart, but not heart. Stop me if you've figured out the pattern. They looked as if they belonged, but they weren't doing their jobs. And when they were really needed, boom. Chemo worked because cells are basically tumors. Chemo shrunk them. You're still gonna say no, aren't you?"
You've no proof.,I have the brain scan.
The normal brain scan.,This is why I need to take off her head.
To treat or to prove you're right?,"To treat. Chemo's not killing anything. It's just hiding the real pRoblem. She's gonna crash. If we wait until she does crash, it might be too late."
"So the next step is what? I say no, and then you do something to make her crash so that I'll think you've proven your theory?",I would nEver do that.
She's crashing!,"You might want to check her IV. From here, it looks like saline instead of chemo."
"Yeah, they look identical.",Still. You should pRobably check.
You switched her meds?,How could I? I had no access.
Close her back up.,Do the surgery.
There's no reason to ï¿½,No reason not to. The stupidly dangerous part is already over with.
Is that someone's brain?,Except for the part that isn't brain.
"Hey, that's the Patient I ï¿½ You said she'd be fine.",I'm a better liar than you are.
"I swapped her meds. I mean, she's got a brain pRoblem. I coulda killed her.","Yup. The neural net will show us how fast her neurons are firing. If there's something in the way, say... Brain that's not brain, the normal neural impulses will be sucked into a vortex because they're unable to do their job. The computer will then process it and give us a picture of where to cut."
Cool.,Excuse me?
"Sorry, I thought that's what you wanted to hear. You think all this is amazingly cool. And you have no one else, so you're paying a guy to listen. Sorry ï¿½just trying to save you some cash.",I'm on the clock.
House?,I see it. Can you get it?
I think so.,Turns out you didn't kill her.
"Why are you just standing there, Dr. House?",How'd you know who it is?
I can smell you.,"Yeah, like you're a field of roses. Peppermint tea."
You Ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?,"NEver really bought that. I don't care how often a kid cries, he's being eaten by a wolf, mom's gonna come running. The world is ugly. People kill. They go hungry. Just proving a point. People are asses."
Why are you telling me this stuff?,"Because the world is not as ugly as you think it is. Your transplanted cornea's fine, your eye is fine, but your brain wasn't working right. I'm gonna take the gauze off your eyes now. It's gonna be bright."
I know.,"The brain cells that weren't brain cells were in the way of processing visual information correctly. After the transplant, you could see, but not see."
I could see. I could read.,"Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know. What I do know is that you were not seeing what Everyone else was seeing."
And now? Things are gonna be... beautiful?,Things'll be what they are. How do I look?
You look sad.,Hey. Is there any way I could put you on retainer?
What do you mean? It's her portrait. What's wrong with it?,Why's this in here?
"First column, last entry.",Today is going to be a good day.
This him?,No.
Yes.,She means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?
"This hospital's not putting a private investigator on retainer. Nor is it gonna pay any more phony repairs on vending maParknes, cryostats, or elevators.",Information saves lives. Saving lives saves money.
Uh! thank you.,You don't like her shoes. You like her legs.
It sounds less creepy if you say shoes.,"Less creepy, more gay."
That's my firm's motto. What is a cryostat?,No idea. WhoEver fixed ours is about to get stiffed.
"If he's like the other struggling artists I've known, he's also into drugs. We should! What are you looking at?","Apparently, a moron. One, ER routinely tests for drugs. If it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file. Two, who pays 12% interest on a car loan?"
How did you ï¿½? Did you run a credit check on me?,"No. That would be illegal. Interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though! What? It's part of my job."
Your job is to diagnose Patients.,"Which I do with the team. How am I supposed to know how best to utilize that team if I don't know Everything about them? Say that Van Gogh turns out to have neurosyphilis, and our last vial of penicillin is in a storeroom at the end of a 20-mile hallway with a two-foot high ceiling."
You've discovered that one of us has been hiding the ability to stretch or shrink themselves?,"No. I would nEver out someone's super powers. This, on the other hand!"
"Who needs an MRI with contrast, we've established that. What do you got on Taub?",I got nothing on Taub.
"Could also be environmental. We should check his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.","Taub's wife, on the other hand!"
House. That's enough.,Dad's right. This is no time for gossip. A Patient desperately needs our help. Check his head and his House.
Can't Lucas ï¿½,Nope. He's very busy.
His place was clean.,"So is his head. Even with contrast, no masses, no lesions. A neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause."
Time course means we can rule out cancer and MS.,Just leaves toxins or drugs.
You called Thirteen a moron for thinking it was drugs.,"Yeah. When she said it, she had other options. And I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your ï¿½"
He'll nEver consent to petrosal vein sampling.,Really?
He was nervous about an injection of contrast.,"Is his girlfriend hot? I'm not talking fEver here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?"
"Very! and if he dies, it's good news for all of us, but ï¿½",That explains why all his paintings suck. And what's wrong with him.
Where are you going?,To tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.
He doesn't.,I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.
I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.,You seem to have a massive brain tumor.
He's Dr. House. He's pleased to meet you.,"We found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open. It's risky, but it's the only way to save your life."
No.,Wrong answer.
I'm not allowed to say no?,"You're not allowed to not be terrified. There's only two good reasons not to be terrified in a hospital. You're delusional. But then you're not afraid of contrast material either. Or you know you're fine. Since we haven't told you you're fine, you obviously have information that we don't have. What drugs are you on?"
His drug tests were clean.,Drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.
What are you talking about?,"Hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful. She's stupid enough to be fooled by the canvases, but bank accounts don't lie. He needed money. There's not Many jobs you can do that don't require time, training, and intelligence. And I know you're not a news anchor or a supermodel, 'cause those jobs seldom cause agnosia. He's a guinea pig. Companies pay him to test their untested drugs. Did hottie go for a pee or coffee? Either way, I don't think we should waste any time on denials."
Three.,"Admirable. Not Many idiots have that much ambition. You've been symptom-free since your admission, so whatEver you took has pRobably cleared your system now. You'll be fine. Keep him overnight, just to make sure, and get the names of all the trials he's been in."
You gonna tell Heather?,"Couldn't, Even if I cared enough to want to."
"Couldn't, Even if I cared enough to want to.",Not bad. You almost made it the whole day.
What'd you find out?,The point is to see how Everyone reacts. Let me go get the rest of the gang.
"Cut the crap, House.",Your wife has a separate bank account in her name only. She's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now. No withdrawals! yet.
That's it? A bank account?,A secret bank account.
What makes you think it's a secret?,"Because if it wasn't, you'd call it ""the"" bank account."
"Damn. Always forget to use the right article when lying. It's not secret. We're refurnishing. We set the budget, set up an account. I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.","You're spending almost $100,000 on furniture?"
He said you told him he was better. What's happening? What's wrong with him?,She is hot.
She is hot.,Obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.
"None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.","By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It's like the mod squad. No one could stop them."
Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.,"Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate. But people won't test drugs unless they're desperate. We need drugs to save Parkldren and puppies. Ergo, we need desperate people. Ergo, welfare kills sick Parkldren."
First drug ï¿½,"Why don't we call it bisexidrine? Clinical trials involve experimental drugs. Means they don't have comforting, catchy names yet. Just random, unmemorable trial numbers. Go ahead."
"Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant. Phase one indiCated some risk of nausea, ED and insomnia. Second drug.",Cuckoldisol.
She is having an affair?,Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.
My wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.,Shocking. Discuss.
Which is the third drug?,"Worldssorestkneesisil. Cuddy used to have that title, by the way."
"There's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to. If they're not, two million.","And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the pRoblem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting."
If we don't know which ï¿½,Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.
"Rapid detox risks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.","Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis."
You were right about the dialysis. He made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.,And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office. The only difference is I'm gonna be right in front of other people. Which means you're not here to talk about the medicine.
"You can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.",What did she say?
Did you just hear what I said?,"I heard the part about ""you can screw with me at work all you want.""ï¿½Want my advice?"
Of course not.,"Good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do. I only know what you're going to do. You're gonna ï¿½"
I said I didn't want your advice.,"I said this is not advice. You are going to forgive her for opening that account, and you're going to confess Everything you've done, and then you're gonna beg her to forgive you."
What purpose could that possibly serve?,None. Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.
What's your end game?,Where are you?
At the track.,"That's, like, six miles away. How cool are these things?"
I feel like an idiot. The Woman sitting next to him shifts further away.] I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.,You have those night vision goggles?
No.,You're lying.
You like making him miserable. You like driving people away from you.,He deserved to know the truth.
There was no truth until you dug it up.,"You do know that stuff exists Even when you can't see it, right?"
It was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her. Why did it matter to you?,"First of all, stop saying ""a"" truth. There is only one truth."
That may be true for you.,"Miserable people save more lives. If your life has meaning, your job doesn't have to have meaning. Screw-ups are more palatable if you have someone's arms to go cry in."
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Usually I have more of a fight on that one.
So why are you making Taub miserable?,I just said!
Could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.,"Why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice? Sorry. You guys still diagnosing? Thought we'd finished hours ago. You remember, when we decided it was the unproven, unapproved cocktail of drugs he's been downing like! well, like a cocktail."
"He just completed a total dialysis. If it was the drugs, he'd be better.",Or he'd be worse. I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.
You think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?,You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?
It's possible some of the symptoms ï¿½,"Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence. If it's one, we have to find a better way to detox him. If it's two, we have to know which symptoms are withdrawal-related before we can formulate a diagnosis. Which means we have to find a better way to detox him."
So how do we do it?,Hair of the drug that bit him.
"That's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused ï¿½","That's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again. Just much slower. Why are you looking at him?"
Try it out.,You heard the boss! Go!
You heard the boss! Go!,Taub ï¿½
Drugs could have set off a dorMant neurological condition.,"Good point. Coming clean can cause a lot of damage. Alienation, divorce."
My wife's buying me a car.,I was talking about the Patient.
You were wrong.,Divorce was metaphorical.
What about Kluver-Bucy syndrome? Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes. Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.,"Good thing he's got that girlfriend. If it's Kluver-Bucy, his brain'll melt down, he'll try to swallow his own hands, and she can take care of him for the rest of his talentless life."
You owe me an apology. Any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason ï¿½,"You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot."
Withdrawal complications.,"Then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve."
The damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural. We wouldn't see that on the MRI.,"Foreman's right. Go call your wife, tell her you're not coming home 'cause you have to give the Patient a cranial MR angiogram. Then say good night and hang up."
Odd that a Man who can't run would own so Many pairs of sneakers.,You wanna hang this up when you're done?
I have to find something embarrassing about you.,"No, you don't."
"I ordered us Indian. Not too embarrassing, just something credible.","Well, if you hand her that, she's not gonna need you anymore."
"Well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.",I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.
This isn't gonna work.,It's worked so far.
"No, I'm no good at lying.",I know. That's why your cover is that you want to do her.
I like her. I don't wanna do her.,Then what's the point of liking her?
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her. What do you think you're gonna find out about her?,Something! personal. Something embarrassing. I spend half my life negotiating with that Woman. Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.
Okay.,Okay? You're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?
"Here it is. Circle of Willis, the vessels are narrow.","Narrow for you, normal for him. If there were pRoblems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago."
Not if something else changed.,Like?
His heart. He could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.,"I know ""heart"" and ""head"" start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end."
"The experimental drug is causing arrhythmia, which causes low blood pressure. Combine that with those narrow vessels, the brain doesn't get enough blood. That causes all of his symptoms. If we can trigger the arrhythmia and identify it, we might be able to stop it from killing him.",Been home?
No.,Good. Do an EP study. Find the arrhythmia.
"How long you plan on keeping me from going home? Until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?","Guilt fades quickly. By Wednesday, you'll be fine."
Right ventricle. And why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?,Because! if it ain't broke ï¿½
You obviously think it is broke.,"You obviously think it ain't. Your marriage is like a broken toaster. Bread keeps popping out, and you keep calling it toast. Which is weird, because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters and apparently you don't see any difference. It's kind of fascinating."
What's wrong?,"Good news. The test is working. Your heart's freaking out, but it's cool that you're still conscious."
"Going again, charging to 120.",Have you been dyeing your hair?
"House, clear.",Right.
Ow.,The hair is growing in red.
His heart rate is stabilized.,Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.
Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy. Melanin affects hair color. What affects melanin?
Age.,He's turning prematurely crimson?
A genetic disorder. Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.,And make you deaf. Next.
Found a long QT interval. I think it's RoMano-Ward syndrome.,Explains the irregular heart rhythms.
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,But not the ginger nut.
"If he's got RoMano's, he's got at least five gene mutations. Not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.",It also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.
Beta blockers don't work. His heart can't handle an ICD.,"Pete Best. Good God! Has none of you Ever read a history book? The original Beatles drummer. A bunch of nerves controls the tempo of the heart. They're all playing in time, except one dude can't keep the beat. Wrecks the whole thing. So we hire Ringo."
"Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the Patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?","PRobably should have just said that, huh?"
"Start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.",So he saves a fortune on karaoke maParknes and deodorant.
You think he's stable enough for surgery?,"If he was, he wouldn't need it."
"This isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is. It's a new symptom, intermittence.",It's irrelevant.
Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?,Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with RoMano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.
Maybe we missed something. Toxins.,"When? When you checked Every bottle, Every can, Every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?"
He's lost weight since he got here.,That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.
"It's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?",So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?
On his old paintings. We know he hasn't sold one in ages. But there weren't Many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.,"If you're wrong, he could drop dead from RoMano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?"
Just give me a few hours.,You got one.
"It's not the paint, it's the drugs.",He's not on the drugs.
"I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months. They're normal April, June, and August. But they're distorted May, July, September. Every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because Every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously. The statin was one month on, one month off. I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.",They're hiding under the stairs.
In the fat? That doesn't make sense. These drugs aren't fat soluble.,"I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?"
I'm not sure. I think ï¿½,Antacid.
How do you know?,"It makes sense. Also, I'm looking at the file."
She didn't buy it.,Damn. So you didn't get anything.
Nothin'. We pRobably overstepped. You're really not the cheerleader type.,"On the other hand, I figured she pRobably wouldn't figure me as the ""photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper"" type either."
"Heh. Yeah, about that. I took a little trip to your alma mater.",You took a little trip 150 miles.
"Online, by phone. I meant I did research. That's a real photo, isn't it? Wow, that is humiliating.",There was a girl.
"Even more so. That's too bad. You wanted her to see you in a different light, and! not only didn't she see it! She didn't Even beliEve it was possible.","You know, people hate people who have theories about people."
You want me to back off?,Would you?
Are you okay?,I picked Cameron's pocket down in ER. I came up with a doozy.
Your mother called ï¿½ twice.,"She's still healthy. This 25-year-old Woman, on the other hand!"
Her messages sounded kind of urgent.,"Well, that's the way women sound when their spouse of 50 years dies."
Your dad died? Are you ï¿½,"Yep. Fine! Our Patient, who's been known to take a few drinks on non-occasions, vomits blood and collapses on a trip to Parkna. Parknese surgeons cut out a foot of bowel, but the pain is worse now than it was before."
"House, call your mom.","What are you, my mom?"
We can continue this differential in five minutes.,"Are those bags under your eyes? You were up all night. You told her, didn't you?"
"I don't know what your daddy issues are, but don't deflect them on me.",Told his wife he's been getting some strange. She kicked his adulterous tuchus to the curb.
"Anybody read Parknese? Otherwise, we have no idea what these doctors did to her.","Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated."
"What about Meckel's diverticulum? If the surgeons didn't remove the diverticulum, it can cause pain, bleeding.",Too high up for a colonoscopy. CT could miss it. Ultrasound's fastest. And since I'm fastest with the ultrasound!
"House, let me do the ultrasound. You need to deal with your dad and stop ï¿½","I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man."
"I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.",No Meckel's. Were you there for the rice or the reeducation camps?
I was there to track down my biological parents.,"Like a salmon returning to the stream where it was born. Did you become whole again, or did you get eaten by bears?"
They denied my existence.,"Four parents, and not one of them taught you to cover your mouth."
"Doctor, we're her parents.",I'm just a technician. Her doctors will be by later. You can schmooze then.
"Can you let them know that we, uh, we went by her apartment and collected all her medication.",I'm a technician and a doctor.
Did her drinking cause this?,No.
Can you tell her it did?,Licorice root.
"Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.",I threw it to you for a reason. That's what the Parknese doctors gave her. It contains glycyrrhizin.
They were treating her for! SARS?,"Not very effectively. But SARS explains the cough, causes hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect."
Lung involvement isn't very sEvere.,"Okay, well, so call it ""ARS."" Start her on ribavirin and interferon."
Sorry about your father.,I'm not. Are we done emoting now?
"If there's anything I can do, just ï¿½","You know, you're right. I don't think I can sleep alone tonight. And you can tell me that that is liquid Vicodin."
"We're giving IG shots to Everyone who came in contact with your Patient. Shockingly, none of the nurses volunteered to administer yours. It goes better in a large muscle. Drop your pants.","You know, I usually pay tens of dollars to hear that."
The funeral's tomorrow.,My mom called you?
"There is a 3:40 flight out of Newark. If you leave now, you can be in Lexington tonight. Your mother wants you to deliver a eulogy.","""Eulogy,"" from the Greek for ""good word."" Now, if she asked me to deliver a bastardogy, I'd be happy to ï¿½"
"Then be a grown-up. Call your mother back and tell her that you're sick with grief, but you're too busy to be there.",She knows when I'm lying.
I am not doing this because I care.,Cuddy drugged me. She! My mom didn't call Cuddy. She called you. I knew you couldn't stay away. I knew you loved me too much.
I'm doing this for your mom.,"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro."
"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro.",Where's my phone? It's the team. It's their ring tone. Forget it. The Patient's blood is on your hands.
House? You there?,I'm being held against my will. Call the police!
We need to pinpoint which defect she has so we can start her on the right anticoagulant. Draw her blood. Let's find out which genetic gift her genetic parents gave her.,"Thanks for calling. My ring tone for you is ""Dancing Queen,"" by Abba."
Nicole?,I need to pee. Pull over at the next stop. I'll just pee on the floor. You bought used floor mats? That is brilliant.
There's a rest stop in five miles.,Cane.
The restroom's right there. You can make it on your own.,"I suppose I could talk about the summer he decided he wasn't speaking to me. Two months, not one word. Anything he wanted to say, he typed up and slipped under my bedroom door."
"You don't want to say anything, don't say anything, but go. Tell your mom you're sad for her.","Just by being there, I'd be lying."
"She wants to think, for a moment, that she had a happy family. So give her a gift ï¿½ lie!","Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral."
"Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.",I said I'd go to the funeral. I didn't say when.
This is why we prefer inside.,"You actually keep a flashlight that doesn't need batteries in the trunk? Next to the jacket, emergency water, nail clippers, tooth brush, space blanket ï¿½"
"You know, those aren't just my car keys. My House keys are on there too. Amber gave me that key chain.","No, she didn't. Not unless your pet name for her was ""Volvo."" A Man who would lie about a gift from a dead girlfriend!"
"Is pRobably responding to a Parkldish, pointless act of petulance.",The struggle to resist one's captors is nEver pointless. Vive la rï¿½sistance!
"Well, I hate to break it to you, Che, but simple delay won't work. Your mother will hold the funeral till we get there.","My father was a punctual Man, beholden to time. Two minutes late for dinner, you didn't eat. My mother would nEver disrespect him by starting the funeral late."
"Yeah, yeah, you clearly have no issues to work through.","Come on, forget the keys. Call a locksmith. We'll go inside and play ""guess that smell"" with the truckers while we're waiting. Join me on the dark side."
So he was a bastard. He was still your father. You're biologically programmed to have feelings for him.,"No, I'm not."
Feelings aren't rational. I know you have trouble with anything that can't be quantified and counted.,He's not my biological father. I figured it out when I was 12.
"Of course. You were a brilliant, socially isolated 12-year-old, and you create a parallel universe in which your life doesn't suck.","I look at the facts. First of all, he was deployed on training exercises off Okinawa during the time I had to be conceived."
"And since you're 150 years old, air travel was impossible.",His second toe is longer than his big toe. Mine isn't.
This is sad. You don't beliEve your mother screwed around ï¿½,I have a distinctive red birthmark on my scalp that matches a certain friend of the family.
"If you beliEved this story, you wouldn't be telling me about his birthmarks. You'd be telling me about the genetic testing you had done. And since you haven't mentioned it, obviously, you didn't do it. Because you don't want to ï¿½ House, what are you doing? Get your ï¿½ get off the ï¿½ there's a cop!",Uh-oh.
I think we may need to call House again.,You lost track of your speed? I think that was Hitler's excuse. Lost track of the Jews. No one held him responsible.
"I'm not playing, House.",You were protecting me. Anybody in their right mind would have ratted me out.
I'm just trying to speed things along. You are going to this funeral.,Make it fast. I don't want to miss the anal cavity search.
Looks like a mass in the pancreas.,Not to me. This is radio. And I want a full play-by-play.
"Just get out of the car, sir.",Cyst?
Large cyst. Something going on there?,"Wilson's getting arrested. How large? SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?"
Seriously? What'd you do?,"I'm obviously joking. If Wilson was getting handcuffed on the hood of his car, would I be carrying on a differential?"
Diameter is at least eight centimeters.,Is it in the tail or in the head?
"You too, sir. Out of the car.",We've got a construction site. A steamroller is plowing ï¿½
This is a waste of time.,"I need that phone call. I'm a doctor, and when someone tries to call you three times, it's code for ""pick up the damn phone before someone dies."""
I'm sure there's other smart doctors.,You'd be surprised.
You told me you'd taken care of this.,I did.
First words you Ever said to me.,I took care of it. You must've screwed up somehow.
It's a really old warrant. Isn't there a statute of limitations on this kind of thing?,It's suspended when you flee the state.
I was fresh out of med school. I didn't know anybody at the convention.,"You heard the Man, Wilson. You don't have to explain."
I am not gonna sit here wasting time just so you can avoid your father's funeral!,He's my father. I have the right to avoid his funeral.
"""Leave a Tender Moment"" is a good song.",It's a great song. He was out of line.
"So I ï¿½ I asked the Man to stop, politely.","Yeah, you yelled politely."
"I was polite the first couple of times, but courtesy made no impression on this ass. So I threw a bottle into the mirror, which successfully conveyed my message.",And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror. And set an example to two other patrons who threw shot glasses.
I think I have the picture. I assume you're the guy who was playing the song.,"No, I was the guy who bailed him out."
"This guy was a total stranger to you, and you bailed him out?",It was a boring convention. Had to have somebody to drink with.
"And there's the foundation of our entire friendship. If you hadn't been bored one weekend, it wouldn't Even exist.","Hey, there were 3,000 people at that convention. You were the one I thought wasn't boring. That says something."
It also says something that you lied to me about getting the charges dropped!,I got a Lawyer. He cut a deal. You didn't call the guy? You have to show up at the arraignment. Everybody knows that.
You can go.,What? He ï¿½ he's a fugitive from justice. That whole story was lies. He stabbed a Man.
Louisiana doesn't want to pay to get you back.,Forget Louisiana. He was driving recklessly through your comatose village. Do they put lead in the jelly doughnuts here?
They're not now. It's not the gallstones.,"Well, of course it's not gallstones. Who thought it was gallstones?"
"You said ""steamroller.""","I also said ""construction site."""
Gallstones could cause a pancreatic cyst.,"Will you just turn around. The thing is two hours over already, and that's the third time we passed that colonial with the cross burning out front."
I'm not lost.,I'm not talking about what caused the cyst. I'm talking about what the cyst caused. Everything.
"Cysts are symptoms, not diagnoses.","Unless it's a multiple cyst, with connections to other organs! like a steamroller."
Bubbles.,Is that your new stripper name?
"Yes. And also, we inject bubbles into the cyst and follow where they drift. If they end up in the other organs, we know you're right, cut it out, she's fine.",Bubbles is right. Go echo.
"I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it's a load off of my mind just to see you. Thank you, James.","Mom, how could you delay the funeral?"
"Honey, your dad is dead. He's not going to care. Do you know what you're going to say?",I don't know. Just let the minister or one of his buddies from the corps!
"The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want!",I am not talking We were strangers who shared some geography 30 years ago.
"Right, he had no influence on you at all. The father who was compulsive about punctuality.",His issue. Which I deliberately made not my issue.
"Thereby making it your issue. Compulsively showing up four hours late, ignoring discipline, ignoring rules.","Oh, God, he's here."
"Who's here? The one you're pretending is your father? Nice pick. He looks like Sean Connery. So back when you were devising this fantasy, did you tell your father: ""Dad, I refuse to recognize your existence because I have chosen James Bond as my dad""?",I used different words.
What? Hearing that your own son hates you so much he's replaced you in his mind? That's gotta suck. How did he take it?,I already told you. He didn't speak to me for a summer.
"It means more to me than ï¿½ than I can say to have all of you here today. And now, uh, our son Gregory would like to say a few words. Greg?","There's a lot of people here today. Including some from the corps. And I notice that Every one of them is either my father's rank or higher. And that doesn't surprise me. Because, if the test of a Man is how he treats those he has power over, it was a test my father failed. This Man you're eager to pay homage to, he was incapable of admitting any point of view but his own. He punished failure, and he did not accept anything less than ï¿½"

Put it back.,"Well, he's not gonna miss it."
I'm done enabling. You can't Even let them put him in the ground without making it serve your agenda?,You really want to do this in front of Everybody? You wanna punish me or them?
"How can I still feel surprise? You would take, Even this, a moment of real huMan grief, and turn it into a farce.","Oh, cut the crap. You enjoy what I do. I nEver had to force you. You like coming along for the ride."
"Yes, that's why I'm cheering you on now.","This is about you needing to be prepared for the worst. So you become an oncologist. No surprises there. Worst happens all the time. But Amber, she was young and healthy. Her death came out of nowhere."
Don't bring Amber into this.,"And you weren't ready. That makes you angry. The world sucks, and you didn't have time to brace yourself."
What happened out there is your show!,You're scared to death of losing anyone that matters. So you dump the person who matters the most to you!
I'm not scared to death. I'm moving forward!,Because no one can take away from you what you no longer have.
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. Your father's death is about you. Amber's death is about you. I can't imagine why someone wouldn't want to be your friend!","Admit it, you're angry and you're scared of losing me."
"I'm not angry, I'm not scared.",Admit it.
I'm not afraid.,Admit it.
I've lost people. It happens.,Admit it. Admit it!
"What are you, five? Stop repeating ï¿½","Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!"
"Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!",Still not boring.
Did you know I was gonna do that? Because I didn't know I was gonna do that.,"I know you have trouble losing people. In New Orleans, I saw you carrying this express package around the conference. And you wouldn't let it go, but you wouldn't open it. So I peeked at the return address."
"Diamond, Fairbairn.",Divorce attorneys. Your first wife had just served you with papers.
Did you know that when you bailed me out? Were you! doing something nice for me?,What did I say about being boring?
Hello? It's House.,How'd the bubble test go?
House?,The images aren't grainy.
They sure look grainy.,"I've seen pictures of you where you look tall. It's iron overload. Creates speckles on the image, makes it look grainy. Also makes her pancreas fail, her blood clot, and her intestine ï¿½"
Atrial myxoma is more likely.,MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.
MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.,"I'm a doctor in New Jersey, treating one of your clients. A young Woman looking for her biological parents."
"You know, you could just wait for the MRI to have your curiosity satisfied.",What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?
What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?,"Did the parents look tan? The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too."
They don't look more tan than anyone else.,Discolored teeth?
They're farmers ï¿½ the village doesn't Even have a dentist.,Right. Thanks.
"But if it matters, I'm not convinced they were her parents.",Why not?
"Because they said they have no daughter. The Man was adaMant, and the Woman seemed confused and frightened.",Thank you. Differential. Say you're a middle-aged Parknese Woman!
Fine.,Say it.
I'm a middle-aged Parknese Woman.,"Girl comes to you, says that she's your long-lost daughter. Why would you be frightened?"
I'm frightened because she's a threat? Maybe she knows something?,She hasn't seen you since she was an infant.
Maybe an inheritance issue.,They're peasants.
Her very presence is a threat. She ï¿½ what year was she born?,'83.
She's not supposed to be alive. Parkna introduced the one-Parkld policy in 1979. Say they didn't want a girl. They tried to kill her.,Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe the father panics or regrets it. Takes the baby to an orphanage. Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost 25 years later when the girl shows up.,Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago suddenly become relevant to her health now?
Maybe they gave her something toxic. It would have to be fat-soluble.,"This is fun, isn't it?"
"This is fun, isn't it?",Let me see the MRI.
She started vomiting as soon as we started the scan.,"Then let her vomit through the MRI. That's what nurses are for. Her parents tried to kill her. I don't know how, but I know it caused her to get sick 25 years later trying to lift a Buddha. Explain. I already had this conversation with Wilson ï¿½ just go with it."
Poison?,Buddha wouldn't make it worse.
"Maybe the weight stressed her back, which ï¿½",Makes sense if she's nEver lifted anything in her life.
She actually didn't get sick till she tried lifting it that second time. I'm guessing the weight changed.,Anybody have Taub's pager number?
What's up?,"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain."
"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain.","Pins. Push them through the soft fontanelle of an infant, you skewer the brain, and the hair hides the entry wounds. It's the perfect crime."
What changed at the temple?,"Same thing that changed in the MRI. Shockingly, not all religious leaders are honest. I'm guessing these particular monks are bilking the faithful by pushing a magnet up Buddha's butt. There's another one under the table that'll repel or attract, depending on how you shift them. When she picked up that magnet, it moved one of the pins deeper into the sympathetic nervous center of her brain. This sent a signal through the nerves to the blood vessels in her small intestine, which caused the symptoms in Parkna and in the giant magnet we call an MRI. She's lucky. We're all screwed up by our parents. She's got documentation."
I hear your Patient's gonna be all right.,Is that why you're here? A colleague checking up on a Patient?
Something goin' on?,I'm celebrating. My mom hated him too.
"Your DNA test showed no match? That's incredible. At the age of 12, you actually figured out your father wasn't your birth father? That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Why should it depress you?",It doesn't depress me. Doesn't make any difference at all. That's what depresses me.
"Well, I guess nobody gets to choose who their parents are. I'm not Even sure anymore if we get to choose who our friends are. I spoke with Cuddy. She hasn't filled my position yet.",If you're coming back just because you're attracted to the shine of my neediness! I'd be okay with that.
"I'm coming back because you're right. That strange, annoying trip we just took was the most fun I've had since Amber died.",You hungry? Wilson.
Yeah?,My dad's dead.
House.,Eh.
I have a case I think you might be interested in.,Not now.
A 26-year-old Woman had a tonic clonic seizure.,"What about me speeding away says to you ""let's chat""?"
"History of fatigue, and two years ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.",She's diabetic.
"No, she's not. And she has no history of hypertension.",It can wait.
It can wait.,I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.,"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured."
"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.",I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier. I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?
I had a breakfast meeting at Mickey's Diner with the Mercy people to tell them! I'm coming back to work here. Sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me. Donut's a nice touch.,"It's my way of saying ""welcome back."""
The seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological.,Or the ecstasy you found in her system.
"According to Dr. Hadley, the Patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so!",What does Thirteen know about it?
"Uh, apparently she was with the Patient last night.",At 3:00 AM?
At 3:00 AM?,"Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God."
"Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God.","Empty transient sex? I've been waiting for you to spiral out of control, Ever since you got your Huntington's diagnosis, but this is more than I dared hope for."
Not diagnostically relevant.,Depends what we're trying to diagnose. It's how steep of a spiral you're on.
Also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed. Her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.,"Is he in this room? Because if he's not, I don't care what he thinks. Unless he's a she and she was there last night too, in which case I care very deeply."
She parties till 3:00 AM. That's why she's always tired.,Yet you seem fine.
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too Many platelets. Sorry.,"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was."
"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.",I like to watch.
I can handle this alone.,"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me."
"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.","You know, if you're in the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering."
You're Dr. House?,"I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan. You had sex, then a seizure. Could be a particular position or activity that set it off. That sounds like a valid medical theory, doesn't it?"
"WhatEver you think we did, we ï¿½ we did. And then some.",Lights on or off?
Do you have a medical rationalization for that one?,Light sensitivity.
On.,"Figured she had more shame than that. Did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals?"
"She's, uh, pretty direct about what she wants.",I'm learning so much.
I'm learning so much.,"Okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten."
SEven.,Finally got one right.
You want to investigate him because he ate a donut?,He claimed he had a morning meeting at Mickey's Diner. Wilson loves Mickey's Diner. He has the French toast tower whenEver he sets foot in the door. There's no way he would've come to work wanting more carbs. He lied to me. I need to know why.
What do you think you'll find out?,"I'm worried that he might be, a spy."
He's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.,I'm just not sure if he's working for Hirohito or the New England Patriots.
You played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.,"I need something to lord over him, a lie ï¿½"
He didn't try to retaliate. He moralized.,He always moralized.
He always moralized and got Even. He hasn't fired back.,Things always change.
And that sucks.,Yeah. Find out where he was.
We had to use paddles to stabilize the Patient's heart.,"Eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue. Sounds like a real case to me."
"Yeah, I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?","You're just upset! Because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, thRobbing! Diagnostic skills. Drugs would explain Everything."
"This morning, you rejected drugs.",That's when I thought that Thirteen was right and was just jerking her around. Cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.
"That means that something she did at my place set this off. Either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet. And that means my place needs to be searched. Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.",Patient's dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.
"I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.",Who could pick a lock?
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.,You're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.
Think you can pick a lock faster than me?,No need to pick.
Nice. Steal from your employees.,NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.
NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,Always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.
Give me my key.,Don't have your key.
You expect me to beliEve that you hired Lucas to investigate Everyone except for me?,Waste of money.
I already know Everything about you.,Thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the Patient's. Check it for drugs. I call shotgun on the bedroom.
You know that I stole a car when I was a teenager. You know that my mom has Alzheimer's. You know nothing else.,Want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?
Purse is clean.,Last night wasn't the first time that Thirteen brought home some strange.
You found her diary ï¿½,"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless!"
"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. Unless!",You think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy?
There are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.,People interest me. Conversations don't.
Like Thirteen.,Brown recluse. Found it at your apartment. Their venom can cause seizures and heart pRoblems. Unless the ultrasound showed anything ï¿½
No. What room did you find it in?,"Bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing."
I don't have a bidet.,Oh. Spider's not the only interesting thing I found.
Who cares?,"He doesn't. He's just surprised he didn't know. You withhold things other people would nEver bother to. The move, a little wheeze, whatEver you thought was in my pocket instead of your inhaler. Maybe I should make a return trip to your place."
Spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the Patient was actually bitten by a spider. I'll do the exam.,Don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate. It'd be better if a Woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way.
"Blood test confirms low potassium lEvels. Explains the numbness in her hip. It's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.",Which you just wasted with that comment about my comments. Low potassium means her heart pRoblem was a symptom of a kidney pRoblem. What caused the kidney pRoblem?
Could be IgA nephropathy.,Not without blood in the urine.
PSAGN?,Not with normal blood pressure.
"Renal tubular acidosis. Her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood. Excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.","If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis."
"If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis.",What's he doing now?
He's playing that carjacking video game. He'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.,Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.
Like!,Just about anything.
You don't think it's that.,I don't think it's just about anything?
"You don't think it's about anything trivial. If you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.",Maybe he's seeing a shrink.
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,"Doesn't matter if it isn't. Wilson doesn't buy his ""pizza.""ï¿½ There's eight units in this building. There's got to be a pervert like me living in at least one of them."
The breathing pRoblem started after we fixed her kidney pRoblem. Means the RTA isn't the underlying cause.,Where's Thirteen?
Traffic's bad. She's pRobably just ï¿½,Not here.
"It's not her lungs. No masses, no infiltrates.","Her lungs are working, but she still can't breathe."
That could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.,There's only one way to find out if her airway failed. Make it happen again. Stick Thirteen's carpet cleaner on a treadmill. Methacholine challenge. And someone find the carpet.
Just spoke to my brother.,"And by brother, you mean?"
I mean my parents' other son.,Wow. Same dad.
"Got a call last week from your PI. You lied. You did have me investigated. You've been taunting the team with what you've learned, but you nEver came after me. Means you couldn't find anything.",You're right.
You're right.,"That's because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or Even vaguely interesting since you were 17. And that's just sad."
I found her in the clinic giving herself IV fluids.,At least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.
She has a fresh nightclub stamp on her wrist. She's in no condition to practice.,"Unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be ï¿½"
But I can suspend you until you do.,Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn't need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. Let's go.
Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn't need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. Let's go.,Come on.
Thank you.,"By the way, the surgery was not routine, Patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential. You're fired."
What? You just defended me.,"No, I just prEvented you from getting a drug test. PRobably saved your career. I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit."
I don't have a drug habit.,The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass.
The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass.,I haven't sat on this couch for four months. It remembers my cheeks. I miss this.
Me too. Me trying to work. You interrupting.,"Oh, come on. Your Patients can wait five minutes. Get me caught up. Come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby? Did you meet someone?"
"Actually, yes. I sort of, started, dating someone.",Great. What does she do? Is she! an actress?
No. Why would you think that?,I just figured you'd want something a little more! Exciting!
"She's not! You're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her. She's! a prostitute. Used to be. She made some mistakes. Single mom, had some drug issues. But! she's so smart. She wants to go to law school. And! I told her I'd help her with tuition.",How long have you known her?
I knew you'd be like this.,I asked a question.
House! You are a drug addict. You go to prostitutes. You can't be judgmental.,And yet.
"Please, don't do this to me. I was hurting, and I wanted to feel good. I didn't expect it! to go this way. I! Amber! Said that she wanted me to move on. That she wanted me to! Be happy. And ï¿½ Debbie, makes me happy.","If you're happy, I'm!"
"Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms could be Amyloidosis, which we can Manage. Or pulmonary fibrosis which ï¿½",Thank you. My employees can take care of it from here. We need to biopsy the cysts.
You fired me because I screwed up. I just proved I can pull my weight.,All you proved is you know how to make an entrance.
"House, she deserves another shot. She found the cysts, saved the Patient.",Who wouldn't have needed saving if Thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.
"Give her her job back, House.",Or what? You're gonna quit? Go do the biopsy.
I'm sorry.,How much clearer do I need to make this?
"What does that Even mean, ""dating a hooker""?",He's an idiot with a messiah complex. Savior to all who need saving. That's why his first wife had a wooden leg. Second wife was Canadian. He's the one who needs to be saved.
From you or the ho?,The ho's just using him for his money. Wait. Bad example.
"Normally in these situations, I'd follow the girl, find out something embarrassing about her to show him. But since that's our starting position!",Proceed directly to the leg-breaking.
"I'm not breaking her legs. She pRobably has a pimp. Or, at least, an older brother. Or a younger brother. Or overprotective sister.","Find her, find her family, find client number nine. Just get me something I can use to force her to back off."
"Sorry to interrupt your meeting, Mannix. Here's the result from the lung biopsy.","Why not men? You're bisexual. If you were just being self-destructive, you'd be having random sex with men. Better chance of getting assaulted, catParkng a disease. If this were just about getting laid, it'd be a lot easier to pick up men. Or ugly girls. This Woman's hot. Which means you like the challenge, the conquest. It's the control that gets you off. And controlling women is as close as you can get to controlling what's gonna happen to you."
Here I thought I was just into boobs.,"Instead of getting sweaty with a stranger, why don't you try taking it to the next lEvel? Play God. Tell a girl that she's got ten years to live. She has LAM."
Okay.,This is not a test. You're not getting your job back if you can ï¿½
All her blood counts are down. It's a new symptom. Aplastic anemia.,"Does the word ""fired"" have some whole other definition that I'm not aware of?"
I don't work for you. Fine. Don't pay me. Just let me finish out this case.,So you like her now that she's dying. What happens if she stops dying?
"Or mastocytosis, which can cause systemic shock and kill her in days.",Go. Test for Everything. Not you. You're just a visitor.
I'm glad you're here.,She needs a bone marrow transplant.
Test results are back? What's she positive for?,Nothing. But we've got a donor match.
Jumping to a transplant when we don't know what she ï¿½,I know she has a blood disorder. Could be PNH. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or leukemia. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Or thalassemia. She needs a bone marrow ï¿½
"Yeah, I get it. But she'll nEver survive total body irradiation.",So we don't radiate her. Her marrow's nearly wiped out already. Counts almost zero.
"""Almost"" being the key word. The new marrow would attack the old marrow. She'll die from graft-versus-host.",You got a better idea? She trusts you. Go get her consent.
Sometimes I find out things you'd rather not know. This was in his trash. He's using.,You're back.
You're back.,Genius.
Damn. I knew the fake works was too much.,"Well, you had no choice. Where were you gonna go after fake hooker girlfriend? How did you know he was outside?"
"Cane prints. I'm actually kind of insulted. No way I'm a drug addict, but you completely buy that I fell in love with a prostitute?","You played to your strengths. By which I mean you played to your weaknesses. Oh, my God. You invoked your dead girlfriend's name to sell me. You're my hero."
Best $30 I Ever spent.,It's $30? Did you keep her number?
"Unfortunately, I killed her and buried her in the basement.",Shame. Hungry?
Yeah.,"So, seriously. Where were you the other morning?"
"Ugh, don't make me do this again. It has nothing to do with you.",Then tell me.
We're going bowling on Monday. I'm coming over to play poker this weekend. Nothing's changed. You have to trust that.,Okay.
"You're gonna keep following me, aren't you?",It's what we do.
She said yes to the transplant.,Good. You're in a downward spiral of destruction.
I can stop.,You're gonna keep spiraling. Keep screwing around. Slashing away at Every person who tries to help until no one tries to help anymore. Till you hit bottom. Till you're dead. Until then! I can use you.
You're hiring me back?,You did good work.
"I did good work yesterday, and I was still fired. What changed? You wanted me to spend time with her. See if I could still make a connection.","You connected with a diagnosis, not with her."
"You're trying to save me, trying to control me. You're doing exactly what you think that I'm ï¿½",Cracks. You're lips are cracked. You been using your inhaler lately?
Allergies. Don't deflect. You always deflect.,"Did she cry? When you told her that she was gonna die, did she cry?"
She! got upset. She ï¿½,Were. there. tears?
No.,"Chopping an onion releases a mist of syn-propanethial-s-oxide, a chemical irritant which causes people to have a very predictable reaction."
She has no tears.,"It was either this or put on Brian's song. I didn't have time to stop by Wilson's. She has Sjogren's. It attacks the glands that produce tears and saliva. Also, by the way, causes lung cysts and RTA."
It doesn't cause bleeding.,"It's like you and men. Just 'cause you usually don't, doesn't mean you can't."
And it doesn't cause cracked lips in other people.,Lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding ground for a fungus like Candida. Your asthma inhaler did the same for you. Wiped out your mouth's immune system.
So she's got what I've got.,"Just the opportunistic infection, not the underlying condition. Another life saved by girl-on-girl action."
You're gonna be okay.,Methylprednisolone to get the Sjogren's under control. And some artificial tears to maximize the visual impact of this moment.
What do you think?,"Oh, my God! You guys shop here too? Best nipples in Princeton."
Why are you here?,Because he ate the donut.
I'm sure.,"Well, you're clearly not pregnant, so either you're buying this as a gift, or this is some kind of weird ""if you build it, they will come"" moment."
Are you gonna congratulate me?,"If you're happy, I'm ï¿½"
"Great. That's all I need to know. You're late! Okay, bye. 37-year-old male with recurring blackouts.",Tell him to switch from tequila to bourbon. Worked for me.
The three doctors he's already seen already ruled out drugs and alcohol.,"Well, then it's epilepsy. Tell him to buy a hockey helmet ï¿½"
EEG's clean. So is the CT.,Relax. Just because you got approved by an adoption agency doesn't mean you'll get approved by the birth mother. You're a single mom. That puts you somewhere below couples acquitted in day care scandals.
"You're welcome, Dr. House. It is an interesting case.",What time are you seeing the mom?
Are you having your guy follow me?,"I just trashed your social value as a mother, and all I got was a little sarcasm. It means you don't feel the need to defend yourself, which means you're not worried about getting a kid, which means you've already got one."
We're meeting at 11:00. She's due to deliver a baby girl in two weeks.,I'm sure the mom'll be thrilled to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.
She's not a crack baby.,"No, mother's perfectly healthy. She just had to give up the baby in order to continue her work on the huMan genome."
She confessed to some past meth use.,What they don't confess to is almost always more interesting. This is a mistake.
Because a kid you don't know may have some pRoblems you don't know about that she may have passed on to a kid?,"Because you're a control seeking narcissist. Which is fine, good Even, in some jobs. But you're not equipped to handle a real kid, nEver mind a factory second. Where are you meeting her?"
"In a little place called ""follow me and your urologist will be buying himself a new yacht.""","They explained the returns policy, right? It's worse than video games."
Could be post concussion syndrome.,Not without a pre-concussion. Pick a number.
For what?,Cuddy pool. She got the nod. Little tweaker's due in 14 days.
That's great news! I think.,"It's good news. The great news is she insisted that she's not gonna change her mind, which means she's actually thought about changing her mind, which means she's not sure she's ready to be a mom, which means she's not ready to be a mom, which means she's gonna change her mind. The only question is when. $100 buy in. Less than sEven means the next sEven days."
But she's been dying for a kid for three years. No way she's gonna back out now.,Not one of the options.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis could cause absence seizures and memory loss. I'll take 7 to 14.,We have a player.
It's only great news if she wants it to be great news. House knows her better than any of us. I'd rather use a pseudonym.,Good thinking. I say she's gonna meet the mom and bolt. I'm going for the early fold. Check his home for toxins and his sinuses for thrombosises.
Could be some sort of narcolepsy.,Which is caused by!
There's usually genetic history.,Or?
"If you know the answer, can you tell us the answer?",I don't know the answer. Which brings us back to ï¿½ or?
Some sort of environmental trigger.,Which means?
It's a toxin.,So we are?
Being lead down an annoying path.,I honestly don't know where this is going. Just following the clues.
We're right back where we started. The mold we found doesn't cause these symptoms. And there's nothing else at his home.,And?
And you're obnoxious. He nEver goes anywhere else.,Which we know because?
Because he says so. Because his daughter says so. Because they have no reason to lie.,Which proves he nEver goes anywhere else! when! he's!
Conscious.,"Oh, my God, you're right."
He said he had an appointment.,"Next time, let him keep it. Send him home. See where his dreams take him."
There are dozens of other things this rash could indiCate. I want a full fetal work up.,You're losing it. That's what happens when you have kids. Ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears. It's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.
"She had a lace pattern rash, joint pain, and a history of drug abuse. You would've done exactly the same thing.",Uh-huh. And I'd be an excellent father.
Hey! What are you doing?,Baby barf. Maternity ward was handing out free samples.
"Well played, sir. You leave me no choice but to change. My clothes, not my mind.","That's exactly my point. It's not gonna be me and a cup. It's gonna be eight times a day. If you can't handle wearing that stain, you can't handle a baby."
Why do you Even care? It's not like I'm Ever gonna ask you to babysit.,I'm a huManitarian.
"Apparently, Rip's a coke fiend.",So Sleeping Beauty has a Jones for Snow White.
He has no reason to lie. He knows he's sick. His job doesn't drug test. No relationship. His daughter wouldn't find out.,Maybe he just forgot.
Forgot he did cocaine? You're going with forgot over lying?,Fits. Cocaine explains the narcolepsy. Narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking. WhatEver is in the cocaine other than the cocaine explains the memory loss.
"Great, we'll start him on immediate treatment for all kinds of garbage.",You can narrow it down in the lab.
Not without a sample.,So get a sample.
You want us to score cocaine from a drug dealer?,It's exciting.
It's a felony.,It's necessary.
"No, I'm a just a bitch who knows what she wants.","Looks like this kid thing is really working out for you. All of the shopping, none of the stretch marks."
Not a good time.,"Right, kid's getting worse. Blessing in disguise. Although a completely predictable one. You take in strays, don't be surprised by the worms."
Still wearing the sweater.,I didn't say you weren't stubborn. I said you weren't maternal.
Thank you. Go away.,You're getting crankier.
Baby's sick. Sorry I'm not finding the fun in that.,Is it really worth it? Just for the pursuit of unconditional love?
Only you could see that as a bad thing.,It's a fake thing. There's no unconditional love. It's just unconditional need. Don't make this Parkld a victim of your biological clock.
Victim? You think she's better off staying ï¿½,Yes! Because at least she knows she's not qualified for the job.
"Let me guess. I'm gonna tell her not to play ball in the House, but she's not gonna listen.","No, actually, I was going for ""she sneaks her boyfriend in while you're sleeping, and he wants to do it on the desk."" And at first she says no, but she has issues with self-esteem."
You know you're gonna pay for that.,I'm paying for it right now. With wisdom.
We found lactose. The coke was cut with milk powder.,Makes it nutritious.
Not much of a toxin.,It is if he's allergic to milk.
He's not. He has milk in his fridge.,How does he like his coffee?
I don't know. What does that ï¿½,What type of cereal's in the cabinet?
"Cocoa-something. Why, what does it matter?",He likes his coffee black. Milk's for the kid.
How can you be sure?,"Because if he drank the milk, he'd know that he's lactose intolerant. Ask him, then treat him for allergic reaction. If he gets better, we all get to go home early."
The mother had a stage two placental abruption. She's losing blood.,So deliver the baby.
The lungs are ten weeks premature.,"So deliver now, risk the baby. Deliver later, risk the mom. It's not your baby yet. It's not your call."
She'll do whatEver I tell her to do.,"Self-worth issues. That's genetic, you know. You should deliver now."
Right.,Are you serious?
You're not? You just told me ï¿½,The wrong answer. You can give the mom more blood. You can't give the fetus more lungs.
The lungs might work. It's the right decision medically.,And yet you're here.
"To get your opinion, not to get jerked around.","See, this is what's screwed up here. You're not sure that this is the right call, but you are sure that this is what you want to tell her. And that scares you because your motives aren't medical. Some part of you doesn't want this baby, and that part wants to tell her to kill it."
This is an impossible situation. I'm advising her to take the safest route.,Right. Doesn't explain why you changed your sweater.
Right. Doesn't explain why you changed your sweater.,I need your advice.
It's not cancer.,Wow. Can you remove spleens with your mind too?
You're here to talk about Cuddy. The file is a pretext.,Why the hell haven't you come to talk to me about Cuddy? I've been doing all sorts of insane stuff.
"If she can't handle your insanity, she can't handle a baby.",That's exactly my point.
"No, it isn't. You're feeling threatened because she's going onto high school and leaving you behind to repeat the eighth grade.",She's sleeping with the math teacher to get a diploma.
Adoption is cheating? Are they giving her a fake kid?,"That's the pRoblem. She gets to have a relationship with a kid, but she can't handle one with an adult. So she's gonna kill it."
"Well, it does seem cleaner. I've seen the file. She's making a judgment call.",Decisions are nEver made in a vacuum.
Just like your decision to make her miserable. You're doing this because we no longer have inkwells and Cuddy doesn't have pigtails.,Why do you think I did that?
Because there aren't any. I think! You're sweating blood.,Guy's bleeding out of his pores. What does that tell us? Other than that you don't want to play basketball against him and he's dying?
Leukemia has false negatives all the time.,"So we have four reasons for leukemia, four reasons against."
Only need one against.,"Yeah, if we had one reason for anything else. Go do a bone marrow biopsy."
"Chem panel confirms kidney failure, end stage.",Got him on dialysis?
BP's too low.,Too bad. It would've been nice to have more than an hour or two to solve this thing.
Hemachromatosis?,He have tiny testes?
No. Scleroderma.,"His skin's darker, not lighter. As much fun as 20 questions tends to be, he's blowing blood out of Every orifice, you think it just might be vascular?"
Vasculitis?,"If I had said it might be ""vitas gerular,"" would you have said ""Vitas Gerulaitis?"" Test him for vasculitis, angio and blood."
"Even if we're right, he's gonna need a kidney transplant.",Test the daughter.
She's 12.,Small kidney. It just means he won't pee as much. Great for road trips.
"I meant she's a minor and daddy has a conflict, so we're gonna need Cuddy's sign off.",So get it.
Clamp. Suction. Entering the abdominal cavity. There's the head.,Got a minute?
"Well, why is he here?",Better question is why is she here? You're an administrator. Administrate. I have a Patient's daughter needs a guardian ad litem.
That's it.,Tests are inconclusive. But either way he's gonna need ï¿½
"House, get out!",This doesn't need you. I do.
Later.,Later's too late.
She's! yours now.,"Mazel Tov. Now it's time to say those magic words you'll be telling her for the rest of her life, ""Mommy's gotta go to work.""ï¿½"
Have the risks of the transplant procedure been explained to you?,Damn it. I was hoping you weren't going to ask her that. Of course she knows. Can you just sign the paperwork?
Dr. House explained to you that all surgeries carry risk? You could die.,"And if you don't do it, daddy will die."
Stop pressuring her.,Sorry. Daddy's perfectly healthy. But we want you to give him a kidney anyway because it'd be cool if he had three.
"Okay, go ahead.",No.
I'm saying you can proceed.,"I'm saying I can't. WhatEver he has, she has too. She's sleepwalking."
"If we don't give him a new kidney, he's dead in a week. We have to transplant.","When your remote has a dead battery, you don't replace it with another dead battery. WhatEver's killing the dad's kidneys is gonna kill the kid's too."
"It narrows it down to any one of a dozen genetic disorders, each of which takes more than a week to run.",Call Foreman. Get to work.
Cuddy is positively aglow. What's your theory? She's only acting happy to make you miserable?,I need a genetic disease.
I'm sure you're carrying a few.,"Symptoms are kidney failure, bleeding, and insomnia."
"You paid off the pool? Technically, anyone who didn't enter is a winner.",It's not over yet. Everyone's happy until they unwrap that pretty present and find they got a wall clock in the shape of Africa.
"Adoption's a cheat, remember? There's no real pregnancy, so there's no stranded dopamine receptors, so there's no postpartum depression. Cuddy will be the happiest new mother you've Ever seen. I've just given you the answer, haven't I? And now you're going to walk out of here without saying a word.",Nope!
Nope!,"Good news. I know what you have, and you're both gonna be fine."
What? Are you serious?,Yes and no.
So you do know what they have?,Yeah.
But they aren't gonna be fine?,No idea. They might be.
Why the hell would you say they were?,To make them happy.
For two seconds?,"Technically, to see if they can be happy. We should've seen a grin, a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something."
They're sick. They're tired.,"They're anhedonic, incapable of experiencing pleasure. Something's bushwhacked their dopamine receptors."
They're depressed. Mom's dead. Dad's dying. You should know that being bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.,Being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.
"But if you can't feel pleasure, what's with the cocaine?","Really? Is that why you do drugs? Because you're happy? Most people do 'em because they want to be happy. His subconscious craved it, needed it."
Most common cause of anhedonia is sParkzophrenia.,"Sure, in white folk."
They're! black?,They're liars. What's your name?
Jerry Harmon.,Your real name. Hosarian? Herzog? H'ali-baba?
Hammoud. Jamal Hammoud. Changed it when we invaded Iraq the first time. How'd you know?,"You and your daughter have Familial Mediterranean FEver. It's a genetic disease contracted by people of Mediterranean descent. Sephardic Jews, Armenians, Arabs. Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney failure, Even lactose intolerance. Symptoms are set off by age and stress. Kid couldn't get happy, but she could get stressed by daddy dying."
You don't know if we'll get better?,Treatment tends to be hit and miss once you reach the sweating blood stage. Start them on colParkcine and melphalan.
"His kidneys are fried. If he doesn't have FMF, the colParkcine will kill him.","Boy, sure hope I'm right."
It's really not the greatest time for gloating.,There's more than one baby in the sea. The world is full of teenage boys riding bareback.
No. I'm done. I can't go through that again.,You're quitting. Just like you quit IVF.
"Yeah, just like that.","There, you just did it again. It's too bad. You would've made a great mother."
"You son of a bitch. When I was getting a baby, you told me I'd suck as a mother. Now that I've lost it, you tell me I'd be great as a mother. Why do you need to negate Everything?",I don't know.
I don't know.,Good night.
35-year-old male ï¿½ crushing headache and three seizures in the last two days.,"So it's a bleed, clot, tumor, metabolic, or infection. Stick him in a CT."
Can't.,I'm assuming he has a giant head.
SEvere agoraphobe. The world scares the hell out of him. So we can only test him with whatEver we can take to him.,Fun.
Only of being shot. He and his girlfriend were mugged sEven years ago. That's when it started.,Anybody can hate huManity after getting shot. Takes a big Man to hate it beforehand.
I talked to him through his door when he had flu last year. I run the community outreach program now.,See? Perfectly reasonable explanation. She's definitely not here trying to work her way back on the team and steal your job or anything.
"He agreed to meet with us. But Even if I can get inside his House, his brain is a black box. We can pick this up in a minute.",What's this?
Take-out menus. But I'm hoping you'll come up with a better answer when Everyone asks what we're talking about. Last night ï¿½,Forget it.
"I know this is awkward, but we need to talk.",There's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness. It tells us not to talk about things.
I was emotional because of the adoption falling through. And you actually let your huMan side show for a moment. That is why we kissed. I just want to say thank you for not! taking advantage.,"You're welcome. Any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you."
What did Cuddy want?,"I kinda hit that last night, so now she's all on my jock."
The only equipment we have is a sonogram and a portable X-ray.,"What part of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole don't you understand?"
"We provoke a seizure. The indicator is the increased electrical activity focused around the abnormality. We do an EEG, see the focus, see where the pRoblem is, which tells us what the pRoblem is.",The Formster and the Camster. Kickin' it old school. Thank God she's not trying to steal your job. Go do it. And search the home for toxins.
"Well, right now I'm not.",Go away.
Did you speak to Cuddy last night?,She's fine. Why would it take anyone more than a few hours to get over misplacing a baby?
You spoke to her?,Kinda hit that. So she's all on my jock.
Wha ï¿½ what?,Huh. Everyone else thought I was kidding.
"You hit? Like making out, or full-on sex or ï¿½",Got a chart laid out with all the bases. I'll take you through it.
Wh ï¿½ what are you gonna do?,What can I do? I'm going to ignore her for the rest of my life. This mosquito bite kept me awake.
Don't care about the bug bite. She's your boss.,So now I have two reasons to ignore her. It was just a kiss.
There's a reason.,Yes. Those large things in her bra.
"You were hiding it from me, means it meant something to you.","Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it within the phrase ""I hit that."""
Stop scratParkng. You'll draw blood.,"Finally you said something useful. If I actually break the skin, it'll let the poison out."
If you! dated Cuddy! there would ï¿½,Sorry. I get better reception when you're not here.
Sorry. I get better reception when you're not here.,What do you got?
His place is totally clean. No animals. No hidden drugs or alcohol. No lead in the paint.,"And since you're not breathing hard, I assume you're not holding Cameron aloft in triumph. Which means no seizures."
"And since you're not breathing hard, I assume you're not holding Cameron aloft in triumph. Which means no seizures.","Hey, speaking of breathing hard, Cameron, you engaged to Chase yet?"
We aren't engaged. Moves things along much faster to just give him the answers. Seizures can also be induced through ï¿½,After six years?
A year and a half. Through sleep deprivation or ï¿½,Sleep deprivation would take too long. You living together?
We spend most nights together. There's a bunch of drugs that can lower a seizure threshold.,And cloud the diagnosis with side effects. His place or yours?
His usually.,Interesting.
You would've said interesting no matter what the answer.,"And no matter what the answer, it would've been interesting. No engagement. Commitment issues. His place, control issues. Not sure whose, but interesting."
"Yeah, moves much faster this way.",Where was the Patient when he had his first seizure?
In his entry hallway getting his mail.,"Getting close to the outdoors, spooked him, raised his BP. Use that fear. Bring him outside."
"He punched out a fireMan. We're doctors, not bouncers.",Okay. So bring the outside to him.
Okay. So bring the outside to him.,"Floors , genuine wood."
Why are they here?,They overheard me announce the half price bank foreclosure in the ER waiting room. Where's Everybody?
"Cameron's with the Patient. Uh, Everybody else went home.",Because they don't need to be here. Neither do you. And yet you are.
Because they don't need to be here. Neither do you. And yet you are.,This way.
Molding's original?,Original? They were here before the House. The shut-in's also original. Come on. Don't be shy.
"House, get them out of here.",Easy for you to say. You're not gonna be making some serious capital gains.
This is cruel.,"And leaving him undiagnosed is what, altruistic? Procedure worked. He's seizing. What do you see?"
Normal theta. Normal delta. This isn't a seizure.,It's something.
Stomach's killing me.,See? It's something.
Partial small bowel obstruction.,Blockage explains the pain. What explains the blockage plus seizures?
"Could be a million things. There's no way to know unless we get him in for an MRI on his head or exploratory surgery so we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.",Wouldn't. Pain changes things.
He told you to stay out of here.,He can Chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.
He can Chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.,"WhatEver your big pRoblem is, it's caused a complication we call ""colon FOS."" ""Fo,"" full of. Since we're in mixed company, ""S"" is stool. Nothing's coming out. So the pain's gonna get worse and worse. We need to stick a pooper scooper in you. We also need to take a look at your bowel."
I made my wishes clear.,"Uh-huh, and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them."
I'm not insane. I ï¿½ I feel pain when I go outside. So it ï¿½ it's rational to avoid that pain.,Except now you're feeling pain inside.
We can give him drugs for the blockage.,"And if it doesn't work? That blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body. WhatEver you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?"
"You obviously can't stand people. But for me, it's worse. All right? I'd rather die in here than live out there.","If you don't mind floppy hair and an annoying accent, I know a surgeon who will operate in your home."
"With the risk of infection, Chase won't actually ï¿½",He's not gonna do surgery in some crazy dude's House.
You just said ï¿½,"What I said was that Chase would put him under at the House, we'd take him to the hospital, open him up, do our thing, then slip him back into his room for the post-op without him Ever finding out that we tricked him. Some of that was implied."
It's unethical.,He'll be asleep.
He gets to make his own calls Even if he's asleep.,"Why are you siding with him? Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes broken people because her husband died. And since Chase isn't all that broken ï¿½"
"Hey, why don't we operate on his infarcted leg while we're at it? Who cares if he said no.",I was risking my life to avoid becoming a cripple. He's doing it to avoid sunlight and fresh air.
Why aren't you arguing with her?,"Because she's right. I don't care where he gets the post-op, just that he gets it. Keep him here."
House. You okay?,Yes. We don't need to talk.
Your hand.,That's weird. I usually don't get the stigmata until Easter.
"Well done. Your Patient called his Lawyer, threatened to sue us. He's now heading home completely undiagnosed.","He'll soon be on his way back. He's sick. He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness. I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in."
What's going on between you and Cuddy?,Bad lovin' gone bad.
Seriously. Why didn't you argue with her? She just threw us off the case.,"Because ignoring her is a lot easier. Convince the Patient to let us back in again. See if you can clear his blockage with lactulose. If this thing kills him before we can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore."
It's like the red badge of idiocy.,"If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accents and I'd be paying Foreman less."
"She kicked you off the case. This is what happens when you don't address it. She acts weird, things get different.",You understand that different implies difference. She's tossed me a million times before.
"No, she always chastises you. And you'd always come running to me to complain. So you're acting different too. You're scared. You are scared to get involved.",How is that scary? It's rational. Emotionally mature people who work together should not date. Guaranteed breakup. Guaranteed ugliness.
"Any relationship that doesn't end in a breakup ends in death. Everything falls apart in the end. That's your worldview. The corollary, which you keep forgetting, is that you have to grab any chance for happiness.",Why does this matter so much to you? Cuddy and I are fine. The only person getting worked up here is you.
I don't want you to be fine. I want you to be happy. I think if you dated her ï¿½,"Are you familiar with the adverb ""vicariously?""ï¿½"
If I wanted to ask her out ï¿½,You did ask her out. Last year. WhatEver happened there?
I don't know. I wasn't interested.,"Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me."
"Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me.",Better or worse?
Worse. Drugs aren't working. I think we should do the surgery in his House like we planned.,"Well, then one of us wasn't paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick."
We prepared the room. We hung the drapes. It's pRobably ten times as sterile as any mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.,We still need Trapper John.
Chase doesn't want anywhere near this surgery. Maybe you could talk to him.,I can't understand a word he says.
I can't understand a word he says.,Taub. Doing anything later?
"I will. And in fact I've nEver done this before because I went to med school, not nurse school.","Hey, wanna see if your client's actually made of money?"
Suture.,Mucosa's pink. Flattened villi.
Intestinal atrophy. It's Whipple's disease.,Explains the seizure and the stomach pain.
Little bleeder here. Cautering.,"Hey, wait. The gas ï¿½"
"Hey, wait. The gas ï¿½",That always happens during surgery. Just the gas build up in the blockage. Nothing to sue about. Treat him for the burns. Put him on antibiotics for the Whipple's. He'll be fine.
We should run a blood test for celiac.,Not fast enough. Not accurate enough. Force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum. See if there's an allergic reaction.
"So is the blood test, which is painless.","Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's coming from the telephone. Force-feed him."
I'm guessing that's a new technique.,"Hey, you remember that idea that Cameron had about trying to torture the Patient into admitting himself?"
Pretty sure it was your idea. You want me to slow down the test?,"Wow. Everyone's got all these great ideas today. So you're thinking Patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful. That actually makes sense."
"You'll increase his pain, but not enough to make a difference. He's on morphine.","He's on morphine now. Pretty soon he'll be on less-phine. 'Cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving Cameron IV bags of saline."
And why do you think I'll be doing this?,Same reason you did the surgery.
That was because it was an emergency.,"No. It was because your marriage is falling apart. When you confess adultery, things tend to go bad. When one part of your life does a Titanic, you make a life raft out of whatEver's left, which makes your job more significant, which is why you did the surgery, why you pulled an all-nighter, and why you'll do this."
She's having me sleep on the couch. Just for a few nights. I'm not doing this to save my job. I'm doing this to save his life.,Right. That's what we'll tell Everyone.
Right. That's what we'll tell Everyone.,Huh.
Huh.,Buzzzzzzz.
Have you considered that it's not my place you really want to be walking into right now?,"Rick Ocasek would kill me if I ï¿½ oh, you mean Cuddy."
"Yeah, she's a little nuts. But she's beautiful, smart, funny, and most important, she can stand you.","Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment."
"House, there is no mosquito. This is all about Cuddy.","Ah, she's bugging me. Poetic."
Have you seen this bug?,Have you seen this bite?
No. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state. Delusional parasitosis.,I am not imagining things.
"House, you're a drug addict. You're always imagining things. You got bitten the night you kissed her. Your itParkng always gets worse when you think about her. You need to address this.",She's my boss.
"No, you're not afraid of authority. You're afraid she actually is right for you. You're afraid to take a chance because it's too big a chance. If it doesn't work with her, then maybe there's no one out there.","I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone. Also, you seen her ass recently?"
You're not staying here.,"Oh, come on."
"No. You can go home. Or you're going to Cuddy's, gonna ring her doorbell! And you're gonna ask her out on a date like regular people do.",At 3:00 in the morning? When do regular people sleep?
Buh-bye.,Is he in enough pain to come in yet?
No. Antibody tests back?,Inconclusive.
Then why are you here?,I missed you. Endoscopy?
Inconclusive.,"Well, then do it again."
Anything?,No pulse. Start CPR.
Who are you calling?,Pizza. You like anchovies? I'm calling the Lawyer. Genuine emergency. He'll okay admission.
He's dying.,Exactly. Hi. Sorry to wake you. Your introvert is having a heart attack.
"House, if we don't restart his heart!",He can survive 15 minutes on oxygen and CPR. We can get him to the hospital in five. Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.
He can survive 15 minutes on oxygen and CPR. We can get him to the hospital in five. Lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.,2123 Holden Green. Patient with PEA.
Clear.,Wait!
"His heart's back to sinus rhythm, but it's bradycardic. Taub's putting in a temporary pacemaker. It'll keep his heart beating for now.","Hey, Cameron, how would you like your old job back? I'm asking 'cause it's the only way I can fire you."
Could be lymphoma.,We'd have seen it on the abdomen. It has to be a poison.
"Unless he's eating a bouquet a day, he couldn't ï¿½",How clean?
Very. He pRobably has a little OCD.,How often do you wash your tub?
Every couple days.,Bleach and ammonia?
Yeah.,You know how kids play toy soldiers in the bath? He likes to re-enact the battle of Ypres three times a week with real gas.
Highly fat soluble. He lost weight after the stomach pain. Explains why his symptoms kept getting worse.,Put him on parenteral steroids and sodium bicarbonate.
"Even if you're right, that external pacemaker's gonna fail Eventually. And I don't have the skills to put in a perManent one.","Well, maybe the poison hasn't completely shot his heart. And you won't have to feel guilty for the rest of your life."
I just tried your House. Where are you?,Clubbing. Good or bad?
Bad. Vitals are dropping. The abdominal pain keeps getting worse.,Means we were too late with the treatment. Tell the Lawyer he's off the clock. We're done.
You're giving up?,Call Taub. Tell him to pick up some morphine. There's no need for the Patient to be in pain.
He's on morphine.,No. He's on saline.
I figured you put him on saline so I switched him back to morphine.,"I love you. When you reach puberty, give me ï¿½ His abdominal pain. That was on morphine?"
Yes. Is there something that causes abdominal pain that doesn't respond to morphine?,I was right. He is being poisoned.
I was right. He is being poisoned.,What's this density on his hip?
Just bone.,Think less boney.
You think he's got lead poisoning?,"Explains the constipation, the nerves, the seizures. Hold him down."
"Explains the constipation, the nerves, the seizures. Hold him down.",You're not gonna feel a thing! Except excruciating pain.
You're not gonna feel a thing! Except excruciating pain.,"The mugger used hollow points. They exploded and left fragments. Your doctors missed a couple hiding behind your hipbone. It's no biggie. Except years later, they started to dissolve, and then, biggie, you started to dissolve."
"I'll start him on chelation. The agoraphobia, could it ï¿½",No. Lead wouldn't have started to disintegrate till years after.
I know you think that. But your life could be better. You ï¿½ you ï¿½ you'd have choices.,He's lying.
About what?,About Everything. About his life. He doesn't Even think he's happy here. He's miserable.
I've got Everything I need.,"Yeah? Well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway? Struck me as a little weird. Thought it might be medically relevant. But it actually just told me that you were pathetic. The day you crashed in your entryway! Was your girlfriend's birthday. You weren't there for the mail. You were trying to go lay flowers on her grave."
"Yeah? Well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway? Struck me as a little weird. Thought it might be medically relevant. But it actually just told me that you were pathetic. The day you crashed in your entryway! Was your girlfriend's birthday. You weren't there for the mail. You were trying to go lay flowers on her grave.","Yeah, he's got PTSD. Yeah, he's agoraphobic. He's also a coward. You want to change your life, do something. Don't beliEve your own rationalizations. Don't lock yourself up and pretend you're happy."
Good morning.,Don't wanna hear it.
So I take it you did not ask Cuddy out.,Yeah.
"Yeah ""I didn't"" or yeah ""I did""?",WhichEver one means you almost had me convinced it was a good idea.
"Oh. (He lets go of the elevator door, which starts to close. House prEvents it from closing with his cane]",Nothing to say?
No.,"No, you don't. Or no, you don't don't?"
WhichEver one means no.,Is this some kind of rEverse ï¿½ ?
She's a factory worker. Means she pRobably works close to a lot of recent immigrants.,Thank God some of those offshore sweat shop jobs are coming back to America.
She's an eMancipated minor.,"In a factory? Either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a Parkld star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway."
"The girl's holding down a job, makes her rent.","On the one hand, Kutner's right. Maybe she's a sweet young thing, not a screw-up lying through her teeth. On the two hand, a pregnancy test only takes five minutes, and we no longer kill rabbits. So in conclusion, shut up, do the tests. What else?"
16 doesn't automatically mean a risky lifestyle.,"Didn't we just have this conversation? Kutner trusts her. Someone else doesn't. So, in conclusion, shut up. Check her home and work for toxins or drugs. Kutner and Foreman, do an echo. Find the extent of the heart damage."
Kutner can do the echo on his own.,Yes! But he'll be very lonely. So I have to ask why?
I've been asked to help run a clinical trial. That okay with you?,Good for your career. Great for your street cred. What's in it for me?
You have four doctors and nEver more than one case. It means I have time to work on other things. And they'll have more chances to step up. Stand on their own.,"And if there's an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?"
"If there's a pRoblem with Sophia or any other Patient, you know I'll be there. The Patient is my priority.","No. Oh, do you want a reason? Clinical trials take time. Your time is my time."
Even if she is: Irrelevant. Echo showed no heart damage.,Would that be the echo that Foreman chose not to run with you after I dashed his new drug discovery dreams?
I didn't screw up the echo.,I know. No structural heart damage.
So if it's not the heart!,It's the heart.
Didn't you just say it's not?,Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia.
She builds her own furniture. You think she skips work because she's feeling a little weak? She needs steroids.,"Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er. Foreman. Start her on beta-blockers. The rest of you, do anything that isn't starting her on beta-blockers."
We started her on haloperidol. She's stable. Lab tests showed the delirium wasn't caused by a metabolic pRoblem. Means we still don't know what caused it.,"Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman."
I didn't switch her meds.,But your decision to stick it to the Man clearly inspired Oliver Twist.
I treated her based on the symptoms she presented.,"You treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process."
"And arrhythmia. The psychotic break caused a surge of adrenaline, but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's not the pRoblem. We're both wrong.",So what causes lung issues and delirium? And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?
Prinzmetal angina.,"Silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful. If you'd run the echo that you didn't run before giving her the beta-blockers that you didn't give her ï¿½ If you'd listened to what Kutner just said, you'd know it's not a heart pRoblem."
No reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm. Leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.,"Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing. And when I say Foreman, I mean! Foreman. I want his signature on the paperwork. I want videotape. I want photographs of him with the Patient on today's newspaper."
"No signs of spasm, impeded blood flow, or brain dysfunction. It's not Prinzmetal's. All the fMRI showed is House was right. She was lying.",Only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.
"We find out our Patient's been raped, and that's your response?",Is she a psych Patient?
Rape could mean STD.,"Thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart. Maybe if we all stopped wringing our hands, we could solve this thing and let her live to have a few more nightmares."
No sign in her bloodwork. Could be lying about the rape.,"Yesterday, you were all BFF. Now you think she's pathological."
She lied about dead parents because it's better than rapist parents. You find that unsympathetic?,That's it.
What's it?,Her whole life's a mess. What rhymes with mess?
"It's not stress. She has none of the usual Manifestations. No hormone imbalance, no cardiac ï¿½","Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious. She's a picture of emotional health. SEvere emotional stress can lead to asymmetric function of the midbrain. Explains the delirium. Interruption of the brain-heart coupling could cause pulmonary edema."
"Even if House is wrong, the treatment's basically anti-anxiety meds. Hard to argue with.","Yes. I agree. It does explain Everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it. Thirteen, make sure he makes sure."
"Yes. I agree. It does explain Everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it. Thirteen, make sure he makes sure.",I went to Cuddy's House. But I didn't go in. Went home without ringing either her metaphorical or actual bell.
Huh.,You're processing.
I'm scrubbing.,"""Huh"" means processing."
"""Huh"" means acknowledging. If you prefer, I could say ""ha,"" or ""hmm,"" or ï¿½",No insights? No opinions? You're disappointed.
You made the decision. I can't tell you what's right for you.,Seriously? 'Cause last week you could. Last year you could. Seems to come pretty easy to you.
Do you want me to tell you what you should do?,I want you to stop thinking that acting inscrutable makes you anything other than annoying.
Interesting.,Holding things in can give you cancer!
Labs show the brown urine was caused by shredded red cells.,"So what messes with her lungs, her mental status, and runs her blood through a wood Parkpper?"
"No, her sodium's normal.","What does her furniture look like? Said it was homemade. Old boxes, what?"
It was wood nailed together.,The wood have little dents or holes?
The desk did. Looked like she had stapled stuff all over it.,"Holes means that it was pressure-treated. Sawing or burning it releases arsenic into the air, into her lungs."
Tests didn't show ï¿½,Because it found a cloak of invisibility hiding ï¿½
"Magical lesions, which appear out of nowhere.","She was cured, then she wasn't."
WBC count would be through the roof.,Put the arsenic back.
You wanna treat a Patient nearly poisoned to death by giving her more poison?,Just because we call something a poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.
It was killing her.,"But since she's still dying, the arsenic obviously wasn't killing her. And since she's now getting worse, the arsenic was obviously fighting the killer. It's a hero. We should be organizing a parade."
APL explains the lesions and why they appeared after we took the arsenic out.,"So, put the arsenic back."
Best match would be a sibling or a parent.,"Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's dying, then load her up with arsenic. Keep her alive till you can convince her that rapist marrow and rapist-enabling marrow work just as well as the unleaded stuff."
We need to talk.,This about the case you didn't want me to know about?
Cuddy?,Foreman. You didn't flinch when you found out about a sixteen-year-old who could be dying in the next few days. Means you're here about someone Even younger dying Even faster.
He needs you.,But he has you.
This boy is going to die. You selfish enough to let it happen?,Pot calling a kettle a pot?
"You're a hypocrite. If our job is to find out what's killing Patients, you'd help this kid. But you'd rather play mind games to prove you're the only one with magical powers.",Wanted something all your own? Now you got it.
Wanted something all your own? Now you got it.,Your disengagement won't work.
I can see that.,"You think that when you tell me what I should do, my instincts are to push back, so that by not telling me what you think I should do, I'll do what you think I should do."
I sound convoluted.,Disengagement is neither artful nor effective.
So my not doing anything isn't causing you to do anything?,Right.
I'm okay with that.,"No, you're not. You are designed to have opinions and to force them on people."
"It's her life. Point wasn't I'm dying. Point was she should live. You should have told her. Instead you tell her to call the cops, give her stats on DNA markers. Everything's by the book. Nothing's Ever personal.",Trying to sleep here!
Biopsy confirmed APL. She needs a bone marrow transplant.,Run the donor banks. I'm going home.
We need to track down her parents.,"I assume she's already said no to that idea, or there'd be no need to screw up your courage before saying it."
Parkldren who've been through trauma can't think clearly. Parkldren who've been through trauma and are dying ï¿½,Guess I'm the only one who cares about Patient rights.
What she wants could kill her. What she needs could save her.,"Our job is to find out what's killing Patients, not treat them for chronic idiocy."
Idiocy is what's killing her.,"And since we can't cure that, I'm going home."
"We could save this Patient, but all you care about is getting your answer.",Your point being?
Donor list turned up a partial match.,So treat her.
It's only a three out of six.,So don't treat her.
She may not last the week. Partial's better than nothing.,So treat her.
She'll reject it. And she'll be too weak to try again when a better match turns up.,"It's my turn now, right?"
If a better match turns up.,"Well, when you decide, get back to me."
She's scared.,Not scared enough. Tell her the thing about emotional reactions is they're definitionally irrational. Or stupid. Might wanna phrase that in your own words.
She wants to deny her parents the satisfaction of saving her life.,That's your rational explanation of her emotional response.
That was her explanation.,That makes sense. How long did it take her to come up with that?
It was her immediate reaction.,That doesn't make sense.
The fact that it makes sense doesn't make sense?,Emotional is immediate. She went to rational first. Means there was no emotional to process.
You're saying she's lying about being raped?,Wouldn't be her first.
She lied about one trauma to cover a worse trauma.,So! what's worse than rape?
So! what's worse than rape?,"Hi, I'm Dr. House. What did you do?"
I don't ï¿½,"Something happened, but it wasn't rape."
BeliEve whatEver you want.,"You're scared, and stubborn, and you don't like people feeling sorry for you. Why not?"
I don't want pity. I just wanna be normal.,"But you know you're not. You need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping. So they won't see the lost, hurt little girl. Because that's not what you see. You see someone who did something terrible! Who deserves to suffer. Who doesn't deserve to live. What did you do?"
"But you know you're not. You need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping. So they won't see the lost, hurt little girl. Because that's not what you see. You see someone who did something terrible! Who deserves to suffer. Who doesn't deserve to live. What did you do?","Eventually, we'll find your parents! If only to deliver the body."
Then they won't care.,"You're an idiot. You'd rather die than face your parents because, what, you broke their Faberge egg?"
"I killed their son. I killed my brother. I was supposed to watch him. He was in the bath. I could hear him laughing. Every time they look at me, it's like I kill him again.","If you don't take your parents' bone marrow! You'll be killing their other Parkld. If they don't hate you now, they will then."
I don't care.,"Sure you do. You want someone to tell you it was just an accident. That it's not that bad, well, it is that bad. And you know it. There's nothing you can do to change that. But there is one thing you can do, to not make it worse."
"Sure you do. You want someone to tell you it was just an accident. That it's not that bad, well, it is that bad. And you know it. There's nothing you can do to change that. But there is one thing you can do, to not make it worse.","If you're here to celebrate the kid's bone marrow transplant working, you missed cake."
I want to do clinical trials.,Already had this conversation.
I've proved that I can work two cases at once. I can do this. And I'm doing it.,Okay.
Okay? Just like that?,Can I give my reasons later! or nEver?
Three days ago you said no.,Three days ago you asked me. Now you told me. Can't say no if it's not a question.
Nice thing you did for Foreman.,He speaks.
He deflects.,I almost cost a four-year-old his life.
"Well, you knew Foreman would figure it out.",Did I?
"You just needed to prove it to him. You're an ass. But, a noble one.",I sound clEver.
Thank you.,"Your little game didn't work. I'm not Foreman, and you're not me."
You wanna talk about her?,Nope.
"You're gonna be okay, House.",Good to know.
"Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.","Well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk. Either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished."
Do you know when she'll be back?,"Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone."
Sorry.,Nice try. Love to help.
Shut up!,You wanted to see doctor ï¿½
"I said shut up. I'm sick, and I want to know why. I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now! Or I'm gonna start killing people.",What seems to be the pRoblem?
"Okay, okay. Just move it. You know, you don't have to point the gun, Man. We're gonna do whatEver you want.","No, we're not."
House!,"That's a bathroom you're barricading. It might come in handy, especially since you've clEverly decided to take a bunch of sick people hostage."
Do it! My medical records. I need you to read them.,"You really think that reenacting ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the best way to get diagnosed? I'm sure you've been waiting for hours in an uncomfortable chair, but you should watch the movie all the way through."
"I've been to 16 doctors in the last two years. Had three full-body CTs and two MRIs, sEven blood panels, and one homeopathic consult.",And all that was missing was the threat of violence.
"What's missing is an answer! I can't breathe! I'm tired! all the time. I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.","That's a cool constellation of symptoms. It could be something minor. At least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists."
You barely looked at the file.,"No need. Symptoms ï¿½ those are the things you keep whining about. Tests ï¿½ negative, or you wouldn't be here. History ï¿½ shy, quiet kid. Kept to himself. Collected comic books and missing Parkldren."
"Excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.","Next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it."
I'll be okay.,"If you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict. What kind of breathing pRoblems?"
Shortness of breath. And sharp pain when ï¿½ when I inhale.,"So you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right? Me, I rarely kidnap someone unless I've got a serious health pRoblem. Since you're not almost dead, it means you're armed because you're blaming something other than your health on your health."
I've nEver been married.,Oh. Got a match?
Why?,Because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
I'll look in Cuddy's desk.,Stay out of the desk! Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does.
"No, I ï¿½ I don't.",Right. You just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.
Hey!,You figure that two people snuck weapons into the clinic today?
Slowly.,"Hold it out as far as you can. Try to blow it out. Decreased lung volume. Heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain. An intermittent rash ï¿½ could be 100 things. If you add on that final symptom, it can only be pulmonary scleroderma."
What final symptom? Those were all my symptoms.,"Last one is the 16 doctors who missed it. Simple alkylating agent, case solved. See you on visitor's day."
"Last one is the 16 doctors who missed it. Simple alkylating agent, case solved. See you on visitor's day.",Crime scene!
"House, what's going on in there? Is Everyone all right?",About to be. Assuming he's not lying. But he seems like a pretty straight arrow to me. I'm gonna need some propofol to prove that it's pulmonary scleroderma. Then we all get to go home.
Propofol? You sure ï¿½,Have one of the guards bring it in.
No one is leaving. She's not a cop? Dr. Cuddy brings in the drugs. Alone.,She might be armed. I'd have her deliver it shirtless.
She might be armed. I'd have her deliver it shirtless.,Who is it?
"Oh, God, House. Maybe we should wait for ï¿½",Guys with Even bigger guns?
Say good-bye or I shoot her.,Roll up your sleEve.
Give it to someone else first.,You're the only one who needs it.
"Give it to someone else. If it goes in okay, you can give a second dose to me. I don't care who. Just pick someone.","Again, had your brilliant plan included a roomful of hostages that don't have fetuses, bacterial and fungal infections, leaving their immune systems too weak to deal with the metabolic strain, or are already on pain killers that have fatal interactions!"
"Aw, come on, Man. Don't take it out on us. You got a pRoblem with doctors? Take it out on the doctors. Give it to her.",She's sick. You are a very large creep. Take off your shirt. Satisfied?
Fine.,Roll up your sleEve.
You think I'm an idiot? Huh? That's what you think?,I thought I had a little more time with a guy that size. You're not gonna do anything. You still need me.
Hoh. Come on!,What are you doing? He didn't do anything.
You're right. I need you. I also need you to know you can't screw with me.,It's for you.
It's House.,Joe's Bar and Grill.
"It's Foreman, and Every fellow you've had in the last five years.","What causes low lung volume, heart palpitations, fatigue, stomach pain, insomnia, and a rash?"
"This is pathetic. If I strap a bomb to my chest, do I get sEven doctors attending to me?",Dr. Chase. On the off chance you have some brilliant escape plan and are the vengeful type.
Do you think he's the only guy in New Jersey with an unsolved illness and a pistol? I'm not playing this game.,Seriously? You're walking out?
"No, he's just kidding. He's right here.","Throw me that marker, will you?"
Heart palpitations and fatigue ï¿½ could be a cancer that's spread from the lungs.,Next!
I think he's going into shock.,First rule of triage: Guys with guns go first. Next!
You needed to write four things down to remember 'em?,"It's not my wall. You're gonna get some special deliveries. Foreman, we're gonna draw blood. Run tests for infection and cancer. Cameron, comb through his medical records. See if any of his past 900 medications could have screwed up his heart. Taub and Kutner, go to his apartment, check for neurotoxins."
"873 Marshall, South Brunswick. Back window's unlocked.",Giving out your address. Clearly you're not going back there. Means you do have an end game.
I'm Lieutenant BowMan. How's Everyone doing in there?,"Got one lower limb flesh wound, another guy unconscious. Unfortunately, not the guy we hoped. We're gonna need someone to deliver his blood. It's gonna be hard to play doctor ï¿½"
Get back! Get back! I will kill her unless you back the hell out of there now!,Interesting. Anybody else hear those guys outside? Anybody? He's got hyperacusis.
What does that mean?,It means we have a favorite. It's nerve related.
Amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.,Puff out your cheeks. Come on. Now big mug shot smile.
Left side facial weakness.,SEventh nerve palsy. Plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines. It's post-herpetic neuralgia.
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?,I'm not judging here. This thing is just as likely to be caused by Parkcken pox.
I need proof now.,"There is a test. It's dangerous and painful while the treatment is safe and painless. But you make a good point. You need proof now. I'll order up the test. If you have neuralgia, you won't feel it going in."
It only hurts if your diagnosis is wrong?,Win-win.
You're gonna send in!,Capsaicin. 200 micrograms.
"Jason, I'm not gonna let her do that.","First ï¿½ don't use his name so much. It doesn't sound reassuring, it just sounds creepy. Second ï¿½ come on, he's not gonna shoot the one person he trusts to bring in his medication. He's gonna shoot the hostages if she doesn't bring it in."
Who's taking the first dose?,Anybody here got a long-standing case of neuralgia that's killed their nerves so this won't hurt at all?
How bad does it hurt?,You're looking to be the hero?
How old are you?,The guy's got a gun. I think that covers the parental consent issue.
Ah. No way am I taking that crap. Come on.,You have to. It's the rules.
I'll do it.,This is a lEvel of risk taking beyond anonymous girl-on-girl action.
They're Patients. I'm a doctor.,"With a degenerative, drug-unfriendly illness."
Everything's not some fascinating character flaw.,This is a genetic flaw. This is your Huntington's speaking. This is you waving a white flag at the world.
"Yes, I have a shortened life span. Another reason why I'm objectively the right choice.","Wow! I would have laid money you had herpes. Your turn. So why are we here? We've ruled out immediate risk of death, lost love. That just leaves! work? You're defined by your work. But you kept seeing doctors, kept missing time. Couldn't focus. Maybe you made a huge mistake! got fired."
I just want an answer.,I know. I'm asking why.
White blood cell count's normal. It's not infection.,"So either his heart's on the fritz, or he's got cancer."
Classic signs of an upper-lobe tumor.,Or she's just ugly.
It's his heart.,You can't be sure what ï¿½
What are you doing?,I am going to try to strangle you faster than you can pull a trigger.
He needs to check your pulse.,It's racing. 160.
Don't. He didn't mean to ï¿½,Shut up! All of you.
What are ï¿½ what are you doing? What are you doing?,Carotid massage! gotta slow your heart. It's 200.
"Well, get the paddles.",Uh-uh. Whole point of those things is to make your muscles contract. They don't discriminate against trigger fingers.
Nobody gets my gun. Send in paddles!,Don't!
Get the damn paddles! Or I'll shoot you.,"Threatening to shoot the guy who's diagnosing you makes a lot of sense. Actually doing it, not so much."
We can cardiovert chemically.,If we don't know what kind of heart rhythm it is ï¿½
No one goes anywhere!,"If she doesn't come back, you've got plenty of other people you can shoot."
You! come here. All right! 30 seconds.,She's gonna go.
She's gonna come back.,She should go.
He'll kill him.,But not her.
That your version of morality?,"If you don't think your life is worth more than someone else's, sign your donor card and kill yourself."
She takes it first.,"Adenosine slows the heart. Which is fine, if it's beating fast like yours. Not fine if it's normal, like hers. Following the math on this?"
She takes Everything I take. I don't want anything that cross-reacts.,The martyr's heart is beating dangerously slow. Are we good to go? Your heart's back to normal. No tachycardia. No sign of a heart defect at all. But you're sweating.
I nearly had a heart attack. You're surprised I'm sweating?,"On one side of your face, but not the other."
What's that mean?,A tumor is pressing on your sympathetic nerves. You have lung cancer.
Pulse is down below 50.,So's her IQ. Help her up. Get her heart going faster.
I need proof it's cancer.,Of course you do!
Of course you do!,"It's gotta be a Pancoast tumor. Patient's got dyspnea, sEventh-nerve palsy. He's sweating on one side of his face."
Everything okay in there?,Take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
Lung cancer usually shows up lower than the sEventh nerve. Did you check his throat?,Spit on the floor.
What?,"If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy that it was medically necessary. I'm gonna ask you to piss on her chair next. Dry mouth. His parotid glands aren't working."
"If there's swelling, it's a Pancoast tumor that's metastasized.",Feel that. Right there.
"If it's cancer, there must be a test.",You just did it.
What about an X-ray or something?,"Good idea. Oh, damn. I left my CT maParkne in my other pants."
How Many hostages do you think it would cost me for a trip to radiology?,So! what made you snap? HMOs?
Shut up.,"Nah, you saw 16 doctors. How bad could they have been?"
Shut up!,"Humiliation? Doctors treating you like a piece of meat? Too Many fingers and tubes up your holes. You hate doctors. You want to take back control. If so, I apologize for the fact that you are a piece of meat."
Move around. Anyone moves! I fire.,That's not all. Curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.
You nEver did anything just because you had to know?,NEver shot anyone.
You're not me. This is my body. This is my life. And there's a truth out there. I'd rather rot in jail knowing than! I can't handle not knowing.,Yeah.
Yeah.,What's this?
Starburst artifact. The metal from the gun is ruining the image.,Show him.
Starburst.,"Now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were Ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying. So you have two choices. You can give me the gun and get your answer. Or you can shoot me."
House got him to give up his gun. We just ran.,Why are you still here?
They're gonna be through that door any moment. Just show me the tumor.,There isn't one. I don't know what you have.
You had four theories. You ruled out four theories. Maybe no one can cure me.,He overpowered me and got the gun back.
"You're a coward. You need to know Everything because you're afraid to be wrong. You're so afraid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor, just another huMan being, that you'll risk other people's lives.",I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death. You just want to cheat it by making it come sooner. Gives you the illusion of control.
Can I go?,Sorry. We might need you. How do they expect me to think?
Are you insane?,"He's quick for a sick guy. Dyspnea, anemia, sEventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia. Long passes. Anything. Go."
Loa loa filariasis.,You Ever been to Cameroon or on the Ogowe River? Next.
Histiocytosis X explains the lung involvement and ï¿½,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! We have a new symptom. He is turning his head, favoring his left ear. Means he's partially deaf in the right."
I'm doing this by choice. It's not a symptom.,We'll keep that between us till you talk to your Lawyer. I need dexamethasone and enough time to provoke a respiratory reaction and confirm Cushing's syndrome.
"House, you can't ï¿½","If you have Cushing's, this will slow your breathing."
Give it to her first.,Those were not the terms.
I lied. These drugs could be fake.,Why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
You wouldn't. They would.,"She has Huntington's. If these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver."
"The chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand ï¿½",Don't do ï¿½
"Eight, ten years.",Killing her is your chance to get personal?
So if we get out of here ï¿½,"If she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs. Take a deep breath."
Not knowing what was wrong with me! made me miserable. Maybe that's insane. Doing this! Yeah. Insane. But I had something to gain. You can't take risks with no upside at all.,"I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker. Heart's racing. FEver. And your breathing's unchanged."
Does that mean she!,Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.,"We have to get her out of here. The dexamethasone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the Patient's ï¿½ why?"
"This guy's been on 50 different medications. Maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.","I need to slap you. For diagnostic purposes. Seriously. If I was jerking you around, I'd say I needed to kick you in the groin. That twitch is Chvostek's sign. Don't ask me how Chvostek discovered it. He has calcium deficiency. Drugs that block calcium tend to shield against kidney damage."
He's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.,"Those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years. He has something that has a long incubation period. Something that should have wrecked his kidneys. Something that explains breathing pRoblems, heart pRoblems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood."
LeishManiasis.,Would make perfect sense if our Patient was an Arabian Bedouin.
"Melioidosis. Bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart. It explains Everything.","Except that if you read the history, you'd know that our Patient has nEver been to a tropical climate!"
I've nEver been anywhere south of Florida.,You idiot.
Florida counts?,"Well, not to the Supreme Court. But it's warm enough for germs. You keep blaming doctors when you can't Even give a halfway decent history."
Negotiation's over.,It will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
You can have Dr. House.,Why are you getting rid of me?
I need to trade you for the answer.,You're gonna give her the meds.
No!,"Come on, give 'em to me instead."
She's taken Everything I've taken. The combination of meds could knock me out.,"Her kidneys are failing. You give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you."
I need my answer.,Your obsession is gonna kill her!
Your obsession gave me back the gun!,"It is pointless to give her those drugs. Even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis."
"House, get out of here.",Shut up. I'm not leaving.
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!,Why are you still alive?
About that Huntington's drug trial!,Test confirmed melioidosis. Easy to miss on a stain. Scans and X-rays vary widely.
"Is that all you care about? A moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him Every step.","If he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead. Good thing you enabled my Every medical move."
You think I handled this differently because you were in here?,I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
This is why you and I can't be a! thing.,"If you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship with me, I don't know how I can help you. 'Cause the only change you can make from a non-relationship is!"
You want a relationship?,"God, no. Just trying to follow your logic."
Any idea why we're getting half as Many requests for you as usual?,Democrats' health care plan?
At least we have one case that looks intriguing. 30-year-old fitness trainer suddenly can't breathe. Collapses and breaks her ankle. That's it? You're not gonna argue why this case is beneath you?,No point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.
You can't run away anyway.,That's just mean. Why are we still together?
We are going to our office.,Pronoun confusion. Starts kicking in once you pass Parkld-bearing age.
"Well, that's just mean. My office was recently destroyed. I thought I'd use the office of the doctor directly responsible.",I think the Patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.
My desk won't fit in his cell. You can use our outer office.,Where's Foreman and Thirteen?
What's Cuddy doing in your office?,Other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?
These walls aren't soundproof.,I'm well aware. Normal CT means that her lung pRoblem has the distinction of having nothing to do with her lungs.
"Steroids. No one looks this fit without cheating. Anabolic steroids hack away at the immune system, left her open to a pulmonary infection.",Wow. Muscles and curves. My penis is so confused.
She has infomercials to sell her DVDs. What? I'm up late a lot.,And you actually beliEve what you see on TV. Go run the labs.
The labs are back. And there's no sign of steroid use. Can someone please read her file?,Can someone please stop backseat differentialating?
"Perfect, except that she was jogging half a mile from the nearest road. In the cold. Cold air hits the lungs, sets off an attack. Exercise-induced asthma.","Nice try. Except EIA doesn't account for the elevated BP, if you'd read the file. Come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain."
Her BP's fine.,I know.
Exercise-induced asthma actually fits.,I know. You know. She can't know.
The only good way to test for EIA is to recreate the conditions in which the attack occurred. But we can't exactly make her run out in the cold on a broken ankle.,Get creative.
Shut up. Stop. You can stop feeling guilty. Your best tapping rate was .004 taps per millisecond. Means your nerves have started degenerating.,"You wanna work in here? Fine. Me too. We'll split the desk, 50-50. That side's yours. This side's mine."
You're right. There's plenty of space here. Neither one of us needs all of it.,So that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.
We shocked her back to sinus rhythm. She's stable. Test didn't set it off. Her EKG was normal.,"Well, she's consistent. The lung pRoblems had nothing to do with her lungs. A heart pRoblem that has nothing to do with her heart. Something is strangling her system."
Carcinoid tumor?,"Find it, cut it out."
"Because our Patient's a big, fat cheater.",Subtle. No way you geniuses could've spotted this.
Hold on a second. Can you do this outside?,"I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here. Where are the smart guys?"
"If you mean Foreman and Thirteen, apparently the first appointment of the drug trial's an all-day thing.",I said yes to this?
Her gastric bypass procedure could cause ï¿½,Forget the bypass. Treat her like a fat girl.
Should we treat her like a 60-year-old Asian Man too? She's not fat.,"Not on the outside. But on the inside, she's still tons of fun."
"When she was obese, she pRobably had type two diabetes. Could've left her with perManent nerve damage.","Ten points for doing what I said. Minus ten points for doing it badly. If this was diabetes-induced nerve damage, it would've kicked in years ago. Have you seen my balls?"
Can you hold on a second?,My balls. Have you seen my balls? Giant one and the red one.
Your plan isn't gonna work.,"Of course it is. I try to make you miserable to make you leave. You deny that it's making you miserable. You try to make me miserable so I'll stop making you miserable. And Eventually you will leave, citing reasons that have nothing to do with misery."
You're not bothering me.,Step one complete.
Sleep apnea explains ï¿½,Apnea would've disappeared when she shrank.
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain. The resulting neurological damage ï¿½,She been snoring?
She didn't mention it.,Did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep?
"No, but ï¿½",This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.
This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.,"Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside. On the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues."
Forget the bypass.,Let the dying girl finish.
You said forget the ï¿½,Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.
Bypass could create malabsorption issues. Leads to low potassium.,Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.
But her intestines aren't. Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption by creating a blind loop of bowel. It ulcerates during exercise. Bacteria get loose in the bloodstream. Migrate to the heart and lungs.,Very not stupid. Bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop. Get some and test it.
He could've come up with SIBO anywhere else in the hospital. You didn't need to come down here and screw with us.,But her wrong idea led to his right one. It was vital screwing.
It is. You just can't appreciate it because it's gonna destroy your career.,"What happened? He call Foreman ""clean and articulate"" again? It is surprising."
Clinic Patients just whining.,What's the poop?
It's gonna take about an hour to spin down the sample.,What are we looking for?
You don't know?,I'm doing my famous Socrates impression. Think I really nailed the accent.
High fat content indiCates SIBO.,And what does fat do in water?
It floats.,What else floats in water?
What else floats in water?,Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab.
Numbness in her left foot is ascending into her leg.,How did she Manage to sneak out for a run?
She said she needed to use the bathroom.,"You two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?"
I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide for good and valid reasons and must've spilled some on my side. Did it waft over to your side?,Cunning plan. You do realize it's gonna stink for hours ï¿½ on both sides.
Or her brain.,Or both.
"Appreciate the life lesson, but 15 minutes give or take isn't gonna make a difference. Get started on your other Patients. I'll be down there when we're done here.","Way to know where your bread is buttered, sister. Up high!"
"But if it's her nerves, it could be transverse myelitis.",Or a million other things. We're gonna stay in the dark until we can figure out if her electrical pRoblem is in her power station or in the high-tension wires. Power station's the brain. Wires are the nerves. Go run an NCV test.
She has muscle weakness. Could indiCate myasthenia gravis.,I had the weirdest dream. You guys did the test in a reasonable amount of time and came back here before I had time to fall asleep. You guys still smell that?
Maybe you should just let her have your office.,"Or! She sends one of yours to the hospital, send one of hers to the morgue. It's not myasthenia gravis. Her breathing's improving and the weakness is in her extremities."
I don't think sabotaging your boss' office is a wise counterattack.,All that is needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.
She pRobably used a lot of botox to tighten up her skin.,True. Could also be any kind of heavy metal toxicity. PSP or arsenic from eating too much seafood. Cadmium from bad bottled water. Lead or nickel from canned fruits or natural grains.
I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.,"It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing: chelation."
The chelation didn't work. Her muscles are still deteriorating.,That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?
Why aren't we doing this in your office?,Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy! overreacted to my overreaction.
Coronaro-cardiac fistula. Even a small hole could cause ï¿½,"This started in the lungs, not the heart. And why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?"
I'm sitting straight.,Trouble in the land of false hope?
Everything is fine. Austrian syndrome.,"Nice deflection. But our Patient doesn't drink. She's a health nut. And Even if I was a cynical guy and thought that she was a liar, I'd have done a tox screen, which would've come back negative for alcohol. You should come to these gatherings more often. Keep you from looking like an idiot. Are you making book, or did something else happen to our Patient?"
Guillain-Barrï¿½. Usually starts as a muscle pain Patients compare to the pain of over-exercising.,So who's paging you? Your wife? Does it worry you that she paged Kutner first?
Guillain-Barrï¿½ fits. Patient didn't notice the initial symptoms because it's no different than how she feels Every day. Her muscle weakness is the precursor to full paralysis.,"Gastric bypass pRobably set it off. Oh, at what price beauty? Go start her on plasmapheresis."
You going over the fence?,"Took three visits, but I finally convinced the contractor that I'm Cuddy's boss. And all the office renovation plans need to go through me."
"You did do the math on this, right? Screwing with her office means her renovations will take longer. Means she will be in your office longer.",See there? I'm having a bidet put in instead of a toilet. Not in addition to. Instead of. You want to know what happened to the old toilet?
She'll be with you where you claim to not want her.,I smashed it with a sledgehammer.
I think in some ancient cultures that was actually considered a proposal of marriage.,Is this fun for you? Analyzing Everyone else's fun away?
"Which means whatEver it is, it's now in her brain.",Where are you going?
Sorry. Treatment.,Does Foreman schedule your appointments by numbers on the clock or just by when I'm in the middle of something?
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time for you. Could be CNS lymphoma.,So losing the 200 pounds was just a coincidence?
What about a prion disease?,"If her brain is slowly turning into a Swiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do."
There are some possible treatments.,Get a brain biopsy to confirm.
You're not cutting into this Woman's brain before you test.,That is the test.
"Not for CNS lymphoma, which is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis. One you can test for non-invasively.",You're obviously not opposed to being invasive.
"Rule out CNS lymphoma first. Then rule out astrocytoma, then rule out other brain tumors!",I hereby declare them ruled out.
"Run the tests. You can do a brain biopsy, but only as a last resort.",Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not.
Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not.,You're not stopping me for medical reasons. You're stopping me! because you have the hots for me.
You're still here because you have the hots for me.,Evidenced by the fact that I'm the one who moved into your office.
It's the biggest office. And I'm not the one that destroyed ï¿½,Why are you dressed like that? Why do you try so hard to get my attention? Are you screwing with me?
Are you screwing with me?,That depends on your answer.
Everybody knows this is going somewhere. I think we're supposed to kiss now.,We already did that. It seemed like the logical next step.
Really? I'm an idiot for being surprised.,Can you leave these?
"Uh, where's Cuddy? It's not CNS lymphoma.",I know.
She's getting worse. You want me to find Cuddy and get her approval for the brain biopsy?,"When you were philandering with impunity, how did that feel?"
"Superficially, I loved it. But deep down, I think I was miserable. Why? What's going on?",You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.
"Okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.",Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself.
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate sEven different things.,Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.
Bad idea to get into a power play with somebody who has the power.,You're fired. Just reinforcing your point.
"WhatEver personal drama you're playing out, you'd be a lot smarter to ï¿½",Thought you said she was sick.
Thought you said she was sick.,Sick people don't spontaneously get better.
"Yes, they do. It's called an immune system.","Sick people who are sick enough to make it to me don't spontaneously get better. Not as pithy, but yeah, technically more accurate. What's the last thing you gave her?"
I took her for an MRI looking for ï¿½,MRIs detect. They don't treat. What did you give her after the MRI?
"I didn't give her anything. She got depressed at the lack of direction. We went to the cafeteria for some chocolate cake. Took her to her room, hung a banana bag, let her rest.",You gave her cake.
She asked for it. I figured ï¿½,You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me.
You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me.,"Feeling crappy again? I brought your cure. I'd give you an IV of this stuff, but the frosting tends to get stuck in the little tubes."
Is this a joke?,"It's not a joke. Not a lie. Not an attempt to defraud in any way. It's an actual licensed physician with an actual diagnosis. Hereditary coproporphyria. Your face is genetically blessed. Your body chemistry is slightly less so. Doesn't make enough of a certain enzyme that I can't pronounce, but it's apparently important for your liver and Everything else. Treatment is a high carb diet rich in sugar. When you were a porker, you were self-medicating."
"We just have to rEverse your gastric bypass and get you back on a high carb, glucose-enriched diet.",The best you you could be is a lot more you. Open the hangar. Here comes the plane.
You don't want to have the surgery?,Understand. There's not Many people who have the guts to admit they'd rather be pretty than healthy. The income's better and you get more action. I'll start you on your drug treatment right away.
House is gonna kill us.,"Slowly. And painfully. You're not only idiots, you're frauds. Fraudulent idiots. Fraudulent idiotic killers, as it turns out."
"House, this was really my ï¿½",Your fault? Yeah! For pretending to be me when you're not Even competent. And your fault for not ratting him out while the Patient was still alive. What she had was easily treatable. She could've been fine. Damn treatment's so simple. Might still be possible.
She was dead.,"She wasn't dead. She wasn't Even sick, you moron. Seriously, how good was she? No formal training. At least not in acting."
Did you see their faces?,I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.
So the CT.,"That was from a Patient three years ago. It was hard to find. But the hair and make-up, getting Chase and Cameron to play along, much easier."
We deserved it. I'll take down the website before ï¿½,"Take it down? Are you kidding? It's way too lucrative to shut it down. For Chase, for me. I earn 50% for letting you use my name. Chop chop. Go to work. First dollars go to expenses. I booked our little thespian here for two full days. That's three G's I owe her."
And you still got 3 hours left.,Do I?
16-year-old female gets pranked and also gets visual hallucinations and vomiting. Turns out to be a failing liver.,Why have Foreman's breasts suddenly started to droop?
Large breasts are a classic symptom of you letting Foreman take vacation days so he can finish his FDA reports before the end of the year.,When are you taking vacation?
Hepatic and neurological involvement ï¿½,"So I understand Foreman's absence. Your presence, not so much."
I'm bringing in a case. You may have noticed me doing that before.,"I've noticed you a lot recently. It's almost as if you have a sexual interest in someone here. Like, say! Taub."
"""Greg, made me think of you.""ï¿½",That's funny. Usually explodes after I do that.
You throwing that away?,Twice. Someone's screwing with me. Forget it.
"Handwriting's kinda girly. You got an admirer, House?","I said, forget the book! Why'd they pick on her?"
She's an overaParkEver. High grades. She volunteers. She's a big target.,I'm assuming literally. Depending on where this school falls on the Healthers scale!
Do you think the kids slipped her something? Their teachers grilled them.,When do teachers nEver know how to motivate their students?
"Well, scratch the hallucinations. That's from the mushrooms. That leaves liver failure and now pulmonary edema.","And you, standing there, beseeParkngly."
Thirteen and Foreman were busy drug trialing and we needed an answer on the overdose so we called her in. She's just updating us.,Convenient.
"This is a good experience for me, as my parents nEver got divorced.",Theories!
House. We all know what's going on here. Cuddy gave you that present.,No. Infections?
I think! I think she loves you.,I told you to lay off the present. and the LSD. We got distracted by the painkillers. Toxins are still the most likely.
"Just tell her how you feel. If you won't, then I will. I'll walk right down there. Damn it. Love like this needs to fly free.",You talked to Wilson.
"He has very girly handwriting, by the way.",I knew I should have just wrapped a new present. You said the Patient volunteered. Where?
"Uh, Pleasant Valley.","Soup kitchen in Trenton. Thirteen, Kutner ï¿½ go search the home and the school. Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the fragrant and contagious homeless men."
"Soup kitchen in Trenton. Thirteen, Kutner ï¿½ go search the home and the school. Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the fragrant and contagious homeless men.","Why don't you just hang out in the video store and tell Everyone Kevin Spacey's Keyser Soze? By the way, that ending really made no sense at all."
You had my present for a year and didn't Even open it?,I had no way of knowing there was an expensive book inside.
"Completely meaningless prank, Even for you.","Stealing your ice cream is a completely meaningless, albeit delicious prank. Observing my team's reactions to unexplained phenomena could've been pretty useful."
"Of all the ways to mess with people, why give yourself an imaginary present?",Have you checked the prices for firemen strippers recently?
"Yes. The holidays. They're hard for you. I get it. You see the people around you giving and receiving gifts, having sustained, meaningful relationships. And, since you can't, something deep in your subconscious makes you create the appearance of a gift. It's sad.",You really passed your psych rotation?
It's too bad you can't just be nice to people. You could get a real present that way.,"If I wanted gifts, I would just look deep into my Patient's eyes and act like you. ""Oh, I'm so sorry you're dying, Mrs. Moron. Of course I'll sleep with you. What I lack in skill, I can make up for in!""ï¿½"
"You just wind up insulting her. Perhaps calling her ""Mrs. Moron.""ï¿½","Right, because I'm physically incapable of being polite."
"Being kind in a sustained, meaningful way? No.","Oh, I get it. You're trying to get me to prove you wrong. Then I'm gonna be nice to all my Patients all through the holiday season and then Mr. Potter won't steal Tiny Tim's porridge. I'm totally on it."
"Yeah. That actually is what I'm trying to do. And the pathetic part is, it's not going to work.",You're right. I gotta stop being such a jerk. Oops. Kinda undercut myself there.
House. It's tuberculosis.,"You got that from an anal swab? Man, you're good."
"It was a more subtle clue. Homeless guy, uncontrollably hacking up blood. Cough's lasted two months. He was cachectic.",Unless you can tie him to the Patient!
"Yes. Again, if only there was some subtle clue like the fact that he was standing next to her in the soup line for a week.",I hate spunk.
"TB can cause lung failure, liver symptoms! Fits.",Start her on the standard regimen.
"Uh, you don't have clinic duty today.",Who says it's a duty?
Who says it's a duty?,Hi. I'm Greg.
Hi. I'm Whitney.,"Hi, Whitney. How can I help you?"
I have a! a terrible headache.,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll get you fixed up. Is there anything else you need like a bottle of water? Coffee? Mint tea?"
"No, but that's so nice. Usually the clinic doctors are kinda rushed.","If you can't be nice, why be a doctor. So, where do you feel the pain?"
In the back of my head here.,"Uh, huh. It's Beccaria's sign. That'll be gone by your third trimester."
"Uh, I'm not in school.",Neither is your fetus.
"Oh, God.",You didn't know that you were pregnant?
How do you! You know that just from the headache?,"How do I know? I missed my period. I got fat, threw up. Oh no, wait. That's how you know."
What?,"I know because of the tight shirt stretched over the swollen boobs, the salt craving you imported into the clinic, the motion sickness patch that doesn't do anything for the kind of sickness that you feel in the morning."
I'm a virgin. So's my fiancï¿½.,I beliEve him.
Aren't there other ways I could get pregnant like sitting on a toilet seat?,"Absolutely. There would need to be a guy sitting between you and the toilet seat. But yes, absolutely. I was doing so well."
Not with the supple neck. I don't know what this is. Four milligrams lorazepam.,"Liver, lungs and now, brain. Which has mysteriously reappeared. Speaking of mysteriously reappeared!"
Her ALT's twenty times normal. Transaminases and PTs way up. She's gonna lose her liver. We gotta get her on a transplant list.,"You keep showing up. You also keep leaving. It's possible that you have the hots for me but really, really hate this kid. It's also remotely possible that I have that rEversed."
Normal complement lEvel. Normal sized liver.,"Does she remind you of! you? No. You weren't a loser in high school. You had Every Tom, Dick and Herschel wet dreaming about you. But she could be making you think of another helpless, chubby little girl you recently met."
You're not really making this about the baby I tried to adopt.,Been a few weeks. Just enough time to get over hurt feelings!
She ate the shrooms days ago. There's no way she'd still be sick.,Unless it also gave her a fungal infection. Give her a prick test and antifungals.
She says you told her you can get pregnant from sitting on a toilet seat.,I said those words but with a particular inflection.
"Well, isn't there any other way? Isn't it possible?","There was a reported case of a Civil War soldier who was shot in the testicles and the! musket ball carried the! non-musket ball into the uterus of a Woman working in a neighboring field. Nine months later, a miracle Parkld was born. Also, maybe she cheated on you."
We do! we do other stuff in bed. Couldn't some of his sperm have made it up there somehow?,"More likely, it came from the guy whose penis made it up there somehow but sure, anything's possible."
I want a paternity test.,Tell him that amnios are dangerous this early on in the pregnancy.
Are they?,Who cares? He doesn't know.
My asthma. They said they'd fix it but it didn't make any difference at all.,"Well, sometimes doctors make mistakes, Anna. We need to try twice as hard to fix them. You using your inhaler?"
All the time. Go through one a week.,You sure you're using it right?
Do I look like an idiot?,No. Why don't you show me how your inhaler works?
"Uh, what was that all about?",Jamaican Parkcken recipes.
The parents said no to the benzos but I still think Natalie's not being honest with me.,So she's willing to die to cover up some boozing.
She's very depressed. She feels like she deserves what the other kids are dishing out on her. I think she either wants to die or she wants the attention that dying gives her.,I have no idea why you care so much. Tell Kutner to start her on benzos.
"House, the parents just ï¿½","Uh, uh, uh. Not the alcoholism. Seizures. Totally different. Don't need their approval for that."
"Uh, uh, uh. Not the alcoholism. Seizures. Totally different. Don't need their approval for that.","You sure you want to know? If it makes it any easier, I'm going to tell you anyway"
What does it say?,Don't leave.
Been waiting here for six hours. Am I the father or not?,"No. But, she also didn't cheat on you."
"No. But, she also didn't cheat on you.",Gotta tell you about this clinic Patient.
Natalie's liver's continuing to fail and now bradycardia. Atropine isn't keeping the heart rate up. We're gonna have to put her on a pacemaker.,"Alcohol withdrawal would cause her heart to race, not crawl."
Didn't come up on the CT scan.,It's hitting all her organs. Could be the blood. What's her alk phos?
"Maybe, but it's higher than you'd expect. Start her on chemo.",And do a bone marrow to confirm.
Why are you ordering tests instead of treatment? Her heart and liver are about to give up. Do whatEver you need to.,Why are you so attached to this girl? It's your call.
What if we're wrong? Maybe we shouldn't have overlooked autoimmunes. High sed rate ï¿½,We went over this. Normal complement lEvel.

What is it?,Thank you from a Patient.
For you?,I saved her marriage by showing that her pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis.
HuMan parthenogenesis? You proved ï¿½,Yep. It's unbelievable. But I personally checked it five times.
How did you check it five times? The cycler's broken. You would have had to send it out. It would have taken ï¿½,"Oh, yeah. That does sound impossible, now that I think of it. I guess the better explanation is that the paternity test showed she cheated so I faked the whole parthenogenesis thingy."
What? Why?,I win.
You faked a scientific miracle just to win a bet with Wilson?,"Mmm, more an argument. I realize it would have been simpler to just fake the paternity test, but hey ï¿½ Christmas spirit and all that."
I think you're confusing nice and evil again. Letting a Woman deceive her husband by inventing a virgin birth just so you canï¿½,"And it obviously would have been more fitting if the baby had been born on Christmas, not just invented then."
"It's not leukemia. Seizures, liver failure ï¿½ It's eclampsia.",Which means we don't have one dead Patient. We have two.
I wanted to apologize. For all of the horrible stuff I did to you in high school. I'm sorry.,What's gonna happen to her?
I spoke to both sets of grandparents. It's too painful. They're putting her up for adoption.,What are you gonna do?
I already spoke to a Lawyer. I become a foster parent and then I adopt.,"Merry Christmas, Cuddy."
I'm sorry. I just! I couldn't take the pain anymore.,"Either I need a new watch, or Mowgli is cutting into your Beauty Sleep."

"House, I've got a DYFS home visit on Friday.",And I've got a w-h-o-r-e visit on ï¿½-
32-year-old male with chronic pain all over.,This is the favor? I was expecting something involving whipped cream and tongue depressors.
He's seen sEven different specialists over three years. No diagnosis and no relief.,"Oh, I am fascinated already. It's like I'm treating myself. He gets cured, and I get to learn a valuable lesson about the milk of huMan kindness."
"If I thought you learned lessons, I nEver would've quit.",So you're wasting a favor because?
I think you can help this guy.,Drug-seeking Patients ï¿½
I'd shoot the guys with the torches. Not one doctor this guy has seen in the past three years has been able to find a single thing wrong with him. What does that tell you?,It means they're idiots. It means we got to start from the beginning. We'll do a pain profile to rule out psychosomatic pain. Search the home. Go home. Get a refill! And a doughnut.
"So would the carbon monoxide he sucked out of his car. It's not a toxic reaction. It's a psychosomatic reaction. The pain profile showed an excessive concern about his physical health, difficulty sleeping, getting out of bed.",He's not in pain because he's depressed. He's depressed because he's in pain.
"Not according to the pain profile you ordered. It's not a diet issue. We should start him on antidepressants for his sake, as well as his family's.",We're not diagnosing his family.
We're not diagnosing you either.,"It's rhabdo. Push IV fluids, check his urine, do a muscle biopsy."
What muscle? He says it hurts all over.,Then she'll biopsy all over.
Where are you going?,"If Cuddy can come in late, I can leave early. If you need anything while I'm gone, just ask Cameron to do it."
Means it's getting worse.,"Got to let the phone ring more than four times when you're calling a cripple. Chronic pain and pulmonary embolism, go."
How'd you know he had ï¿½,"You called after midnight. It's got to a heart pRoblem. Heart only would be consistent with rhabdo, which means Thirteen and Foreman would be singing in the rain, which means it has to be lungs as well."
Hypercoagulable state could cause pain and a PE.,You think the blood clot was caused by a clotting pRoblem. That's helpful.
"What if it's a cancer syndrome, like Trousseau's? Explains blood clots, multifocal pain, lack of obvious physical signs.","And why he's gone three years without anyone seeing it. Check his chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors."
That's not cancer.,No hurry. I already bathed once this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.

I'll help.,"Good thing we don't have a suicidal Patient with a horrific, undiagnosed pain disorder."
We did till we diagnosed it. We found intestinal edema and air in the blood vessels. Pain was vascular.,"If it was vascular, we would've seen unEven pulses."
His blood pressure was unEven. Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.,He had hemorrhages in his fingers.
There's air in the intestine. It has to have come from somewhere.,"Yes, it does."
Will that take away the pain?,"It will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away. Cancel the angio."
He has air in his blood vessels. If we don't open the artery to his intestines ï¿½,"Where can air come from? Hmmm. Air can either come from a breach in the lumen in the small intestine, or in rare instances, air can come from the air. Teeth marks. I'm guessing from when he blew into his IV tube."
Air bubble caused the PE and cardiac arrest.,You tried to finish the job that you started at home.
I lied. I wanna die. Please just let me die.,No.

The pain started in his abdomen near his intestine. The first symptom has got to be key.,"He's had multiple EEGs, all of them cleaner and squeakier than Cuddy's rubber nipples."
What about a glycogen storage disease like McArdle's? It explains the pain. Plus there's plenty of muscle cells in the wall of the intestine.,Fourteen is right. Go run an ischemic forearm test.

"Hopping pain, means it's something in his brain, not his body.","Except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain. Which means you're not using yours. Come on, you're from one of the 12 tribes. You know must know a ton of shysters."
What type of Lawyer do you need? I'll bring it up at the next world domination subcommittee meeting.,Didn't say I needed a Lawyer. I said I needed the name of a Lawyer.
Could still be peripheral. If multiple areas of disc disease ï¿½,Were consistent with a completely spotless MRI. Who represented the hospital when you set that Patient on fire?
Chris Carrick.,Chris? That doesn't sound like a very good Lawyer.
"If we can't Even resolve body versus brain, we're nEver gonna diagnose the guy.",What was the name of the firm?
Caddell and Carrick. It's not like we can chop off his head to see if the pain goes away.,Need to cut off a guy's head. Got to figure out if his pain's coming from his brain or his body. A stiff shot of lidocaine below the brain stem should numb him all the way down to his tippy toes.
"And hearing me say ""no"" over the phone wasn't good enough?",I'm inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.
You know that foster-care official is coming in the morning.,"If they weren't, there'd be no inconvenience."
Do not try and force me to choose between my Parkld ï¿½,I'm forcing you to do your job! If you can't also ï¿½
"Fine, you want to separate a Patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body.","If the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes ï¿½"
"And what about options three, four, and five? His respiratory system freezes, or he dies of infection, or he leaks CNS fluid like a fire hydrant, which would make him wish he were dead?",You need to scratch option five. He's already there.
"You preach objectivity, but as soon as a Patient comes in in pain, all you want to do is look under the hood. You don't care if there's a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.","If I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself."
This should numb Everything from your shoulders down. Any pain that's peripheral should be gone. What are you doing here?,Just stretParkng my leg. Carry on.
Bad pain day today?,About to get better. Don't worry. He's making yours a double.
I remember when the drugs still made things tolerable. I still thought I had good days left.,Turns out you have to live to find out.
"You don't have a family, do you?",Left them all back on Krypton.
"You're alone. That's why you can handle your pain. No need to put up a front, to be what anyone else wants you to be. You're having more bad days lately, aren't you?",Yes.
"No, but less. Four out of ten, maybe five.","Can't be. If whatEver is causing the pain is in your brain, it's still a ten. Periphery is zero."
Which one of you is House?,The big black guy.
"Chris Carrick. Next time you use my name in a threatening e-mail, it won't be just a bill. It'll be a lawsuit.","Can you blame me? The last time that happened, the guy shot me."
What if the spinal block triggered some sort of placebo effect?,Guy's taken the finest opiates Blue Cross can buy. How come they didn't trigger a placebo effect?
"He just started screaming, do something! Please, God, do not let it be what his father has.",I think he's faking.
Where is he going?,Where is it?
Where's what?,"His idiot son distracted the orderlies so that daddy death wish here could down a bottle of isopropyl. Get him on dialysis, or in half an hour, he'll be a corpse."
You're hurting me.,"Remember the feeling. Maybe next time you want to help pops, you'll do a better acting job."
Fabry disease might be able to cause central and peripheral pain.,No angiokeratomata.
Lightning pain from syphilis.,All the syph tests were negative. Why aren't you guys still talking?
Something has to.,Unless! Nothing does.
So now you think ï¿½,Mine's a more interesting version of nothing. It used to be something. We can't find anything because whatEver injury caused the original pain healed a long time ago. The only thing left is the drugs.
Opioid induced pain.,"Pain and the drugs that treat pain work by changing brain chemistry, sometimes to the point where pain receptors read painkillers as killer pain. Take him off the drugs."
"We can't cure him, so we're gonna torture him?",Torture is the cure. Eventually his body will recalibrate itself.
Assuming you're right.,Yes. I find it confusing to assume otherwise.
How would you like to stop taking Vicodin?,Good thing I'm not the Patient.
This is lunacy. You're torturing this guy on a hunch.,"It's the only hunch we've got. If I really wanted to torture him, I'd Manipulate a clinical trial in the hopes that he'd sleep with you."
Are you suggesting I got Thirteen in that trial because of some personal ï¿½,"I think you got her in because of your usual Messiah complex. I think you messed with the appointment schedule because of your ""I like to have sex"" complex. I checked the logs. You moved your most promising Patient right before her. False hope being quite the aphrodisiac."
How's it false if the trials are showing results?,"Well, if it were that promising, you wouldn't have to change the schedule. But, hey! Hope springs eternal."
This was a cooking accident?,First time making cherries jubilee.
Awfully big fire.,"If you ask me, some of the portions in that recipe were off. Sure hope it happens to be covered under, say, section three, subsection 2.2, paragraph one, accidental fire damage, in which case you'd have to replace the entire waterline to fix the sagging pipe."
It's not working.,I know. I started him back on the pain meds! Which means you can leave.
My son was right. I tried for so long to protect him from! But I'm the one who's been selfish. This is no way for him to live.,"Until we get an answer, it's the only way."
There is no answer.,There's always an answer.
"Then what is it? He's been here four days. Three suicide attempts. You don't have an answer. When I saw you! When I saw the cane! I thought, ""thank God. The doctor will understand."" Because I sure as hell don't. My husband thinks it's over. So look me in the eye, tell me you'd want to live like that. Then stabilize him. Get him in decent enough shape for the drive home. So he can finally!",Okay.
"You're insane. You know that, right?",Because I have principles?
Because you paid more to bribe me to lie on your claim than the entire cost of the repair.,"I don't care if I pay, as long as the people who pocketed my premiums for the last nine years also pay. I didn't break the pipe."
"WhatEver. If you want to stick it to the Man, that's fine by me. You happy?","Nope, but I'm right."
"Nope, but I'm right.",Lock up on your way out. And don't touch the piano.
Lock up on your way out. And don't touch the piano.,Testicles. What do they make you think of?
"STDs, testosterone issues, that summer on Fire Island.","Oh, so close. The correct answer is epilepsy."
Epilepsy doesn't cause chronic pain.,"It does if it spreads to the sensory region of the brain, then rewires the pain neurons."
Would've shown up on an EEG.,"Not if the seizures are in a place you can't see on an EEG, a place too deep in the brain, like the area that controls the muscles supporting the!"
Testicles.,"Feels like you got kicked in the nads, doesn't it? The abdominal pain, how it all started. It wasn't the stomach. It was lower, right?"
It's Everywhere.,But when it first started.
It started in the stomach ï¿½ cramps.,"Yeah, like bad gas, or a permeating pain! Like your kidneys were being pulled out through your scrotum."
Why?,Because epilepsy is treatable.
You gonna pay for that?,Nice of you to offer. Now I can actually get some cream cheese.
29-year-old teacher. She works with special needs Parkldren. She ï¿½,"Love what you're wearing. Brings out the blue of the case file, which means it's not from the ER. So why are you here?"
"Because Dr. Cuddy is not here. She's decided to spend some more time at home with the baby for a while. I'm taking over some of her day-to-day responsibilities, like babysitting you.",Interesting. You have your whole life ahead of you. So why would Cuddy want you to die so young?
She figured I'd spent three years working for you. I was inoculated.,"Good. Fun. You get to exercise your newfound power. I squirm under your thumb, resent the student becoming the teacher, and then push comes to shove, and we all get to realize what our real roles should be. Then you put out."
That's why I took the job.,"29-year-old Special Ed Teacher coughs up blood all over Corky. No dyspnea, no weight loss. Why are you smirking?"
"You're gonna destroy her, aren't you?",I am going to do my job. If that involves leaving her a rotting pulp!
Thoracic tumor is a better fit. Erodes into her airway and esophagus ï¿½,"Oh, will you two stop it already?"
Stop what?,Disagreeing.
"Okay, which one of us shouldn't have an opinion?","It's not an opinion. It's a smoke screen. Toss out a lame idea, instead of agreeing with Foreman's better idea because you're worried that'll confirm that he's boldly gone where no Man has gone before."
"Drop it, House. We're seeing each other, end of discussion. Anything else isn't relevant.","It's extremely relevant. Apparently, it colors Everything. Now I have no idea if you have differing opinions because you have differing opinions or because you're just trying to prove that you can think for yourselves."
How about you just Judge our ideas on their own merit?,"Oh, you don't want me to do that. Go run a bleeding-time test, confirm our Patient's blood is screwy, then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why."
"It's her platelets, looked like they had bite marks in them.","So now you're agreeing? Either you folded because I gave you crap, or you broke up, or ï¿½"
"We disagree, you blame our relationship. We agree, you blame our relationship. Don't you see a pRoblem there?",Yes. Don't you?
Could be lymphoma.,Not with normal LDH.
ITP fits. We should start her on methotrexate.,"Absolutely, and total body irradiation."
"TBI will promote cancers, kill her digestive tract.","Don't forget, stop her from bleeding into her brain."
"It's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.",True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. Nobody can stop me from being premature.
True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. Nobody can stop me from being premature.,Got a Patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.
I'm gonna have to call you back. Methotrexate.,"Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own."
Fine.,Really?
"Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.","Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory."
Who?,Nobody. Just because I call him nobody doesn't make me a racist.
"I'm not gonna play games. If you come to me with a request and it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.",I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.
Can I return my phone call now?,I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.
Patient won't respond to methotrexate. Bleeding time hasn't improved.,You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.
Other than that Cameron said you can't.,She said I can.
Then why don't we just do it?,"Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal."
Then why don't we just don't do it?,Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I nEver intended to do it.
"This is gonna be convoluted, isn't it?","I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole ""I can control House"" thing out of her perky little system. So the next time I went back and asked for something marginally crazy, it would seem marginally reasonable, and she'd say yes. So, yeah, slightly convoluted."
Unless we irradiate her. Without the radiation. We book the nuclear lab. We fill out the paperwork. We bring the Patient down there. We do Everything but flip the switch.,Go. Do. Don't flip.
"And is there anything we should be doing, you know, to actually help the Patient?","Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our Patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone."
"The Patient said she had to go pee. Maybe when she got up, she started to urinate. Increased the vagal tone, caused arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.",Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?
It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.,She didn't know that. People don't die from peeing.
Like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table in the procedure room.,"Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins."
Causing her heart to race.,Confirming our diagnosis.
And giving her another heart attack.,"Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes."
You hired me to do this job. Let me do it.,"Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like you guys are in the middle of a conversation. I can wait till Cuddy leaves. You are gonna leave soon, aren't you? I mean, the nurses have got your baby out there. Not that they're gonna kidnap it or anything, but I figured that the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to listen to all the cooing."
"If you're gonna wait, you can wait outside.","Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake. You can't trust that Wilson guy with anything."
It's not a big deal. I was having a bad day.,Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?
For betraying my trust in a vulnerable time? No. Why would that bother me?,"He was worried, made a bad choice. It's not a big deal. I know it seems like crap, you pRobably feel like crap, but it's not. Legally, you haven't adopted her yet. There's no obligations, no strings. It can be undone tomorrow. Emotionally, you'll feel guilty for a while, but the kid! She won't Even know you existed."
You saying I should give her back?,Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.
What did you want?,We got a green light. Go draw the Patient's blood.
Why?,To see if it clumps in the cold.
She's making you confirm your theory before you treat?,She approved the bath. Just thought we ought to do a test to confirm.
I think she was playing you.,Go draw the blood.
You come to procedures now?,Only the ones that might involve stopping the Patient's heart.
Cameron tell you to be here?,Shut up.
"He was extremely sensitive to touch, yet he had a! a tactile fascination with newspaper. I mean, he wouldn't read it. He would just! just touch it, crinkle it. I thought maybe that was a way in. Papier mÃ¢chï¿½ and! and it was. He let me into his world.",Please tell her that talking will ruin the test.
"All the kids ï¿½ I try to become a part of them, and then have them become a part of me.",How much longer till the heart attack?
"I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was eight years old. NEver wanted to be a pediatrician, though.",Now they're both talking.
It's not cold agglutinins.,I'm not surprised. She obviously has brain damage. Seriously.
"She screwed up a room number six years ago, and you decide she has brain damage?",Transposed digits. Classic marker for number confusion. Means she has a lesion in her left parahippocampal region.
I misdialed a phone number this morning. Must be contagious.,She also forgot to pee before your fake test.
So she has a small bladder.,Shows an inability to predict the future.
"Also loCated in the left hemisphere of the brain, close to the parahippocampal region.",Means the damage is ongoing.
"Two subtle clues, six years apart. That's hardly compelling evidence.",I'm compelled.
"That's not what this is. Every time a decent person comes in, you set out to prove that they have brain damage.",I nEver said her deranged personality was a symptom.
You don't need to. I've been here five years. I can hear your thoughts from my apartment.,Can you hear me now?
Move onto another organ.,I did.
The screwed up numbers and forgetting to pee points to her being a huMan being. The platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.,"Or multiple sclerosis. The brain is like the Internet, packets of information constantly flowing from one area to another. Plaques in her brain are like a bad server, slow down the flow. If it's in the parahippocampus, it'll spread to the brain stem, which means it'll be the lungs next. Brain biopsy will show you the plaques."
Or we could not cut into her brain. It's just her pancreas. We should do an ERCP.,"Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudiCate these disputes."
A pancreatic tumor is much more likely to kill her.,"Not this week, not next week, not next month."
The number confusions six years ago. You don't think we have time for an ERCP?,"The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs."
Stop! We have to assume it's the brain.,I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.
"No, we had to assume it's the brain until we prove otherwise. Do an MRI, T-2 images.",You want me to do another test?
"You should be able to see the MS plaques. If they exist, you can do your biopsy.","No. You wanna say yes. You know you should say yes. But you also think that this job is about standing up to me. So you're not gonna say yes. You're not gonna say no. You're just gonna waste time. And the Patient's brain, or pancreas, or whatEver is wrong with her is not gonna wait for you to impress your boss. So pick one, either him or me."
"Even magnified images of her hippocampal region, nothing.",This is surprising.
So can we cancel the biopsy?,Go ahead with the ERCP.
I need to talk to you about Remy.,Who?
Thirteen.,What did you call her?
She's on placebo.,"And you want to change that. I'm the last person you'd Ever come to for ethical advice, literally, which means you've already asked Every other person, and no one's given you the answer you want."
"Or I respect your opinion, and I want to hear what comes to your mind.",Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?
I was mistaken.,Drug gonna cure her?
"It looks promising, reducing symptoms.","No cure then. So, the pros are you might delay the onset of symptoms, give her an extra year, maybe three. She's still dead before you're 45. The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine?"
No.,"There, that wasn't so hard, was it?"
Thank you.,"You're welcome. Unless you love her. If you love her, then you do stupid things."
"The surgeons were able to drain the pleural effusions. The Patient's breathing on her own, but she's still pretty weak.","Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said ""brain""ï¿½?"
"Yes, you predicted that her lungs would fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.","I was right about the where, but not the what. A picornavirus could cause localized demyelination that the MRI wouldn't pick up. If we run a nerve-conduction study on the surface of her brain we'll see the dead spots."
Are you talking about cutting into her skull?,"Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain."
ERCP was negative.,"And she agrees with me because she agrees with me, right, sweetie?"
All we need is a more sensitive test. Endoscopic ultrasound.,Just accept that you've been proven wrong.
You were also proven wrong. Why don't I get a second test?,"Because if I'm right about the brain, then we don't have time to indulge your wrongness."
Let me know when Cameron says yes to cutting off our Patient's skull. I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.,"Good news. I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test."
You wanna remove your Patient's skull.,Remind me to revoke Kutner's telephone privileges.
I didn't realize that was an AMA-approved treatment for MS.,"Not searParkng for MS, but what set it off ï¿½ equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm."
I didn't realize your Patient was a horse.,There's been huMan cases.
Not when it's 30 degrees outside. Transmission is by mosquito.,"So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection. WhatEver it is, it's running rampant in the left side of her brain. When I get in there, I'll get you the specifics."
"You're asking me to let you cut off the top of someone's head. I need more than, ""I'll know it when I see it.""",So you want proof before you let me go looking for the proof? This is the test.
You have to give me something.,"Cuddy's gonna love you. The Patient, on the other hand, is gonna hate you until the day she dies next week. Actually, this idiot will pRobably forgive you."
Don't worry about it. It's just the picture that came with the frame. You can chuck it.,Kid with a raging viral syndrome and three dead mosquitoes. I'm off to storm the Bastille.
These aren't mosquitoes.,Fruit flies. Close enough.
Acute viral nasopharyngitis? One of her students has the common cold?,"Team's not what it used to be. On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep."
So disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?,"Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence."
Now I do this job. You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose.,"I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head. And the only way I can get at it is to cut it open and rip it out, which is apparently the one test you won't let me run. So either I do this, or I do nothing."
What do you want me to do? Say yes just because you're House?,"I'd certainly like that, yeah."
Cameron actually said yes?,"Nope, I'm just obsessive about clean cuticles."
Sawing off the top of her skull and placing electrodes on her brain is insane.,"Right, we should be retesting her pancreas for the umpteenth time."
"You're skipping steps because it's Cameron. You haven't figured her out yet, and you want to see how far you can push.",I'm skipping steps because our Patient is skipping steps on the way to being dead. If you've got a better idea!
"We should remove her spleen. Splenic lymphoma explains the damaged platelets, the heart, the lungs.","If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. Unless I kill her, of course."
"If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. Unless I kill her, of course.","Not only will this allow us to clock your brain's processing speed, you'll also get free cable for the first three months. What's this?"
A blue car. Is that part of the test?,"Nope, my lease is up next month. You like? I'm gonna ask you a series of questions designed to stimulate left-brain function ï¿½ logic, reasoning, pRoblem-solving. Or as my mentor, Old Ben, liked to call it, ""The dark side."" If we find slow areas, we know we found damage. We treat. You go home. Ready?"
"I'd nod yes, but I can't move my head.",This pen is red. Its ink is red. Is all ink red?
Cameron's letting him cut into our Patient's skull based on nothing but dead bugs and someone else's runny nose.,"There are two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon. How Many pints in five gallons?"
"Okay, all right.","That's my old boss. And by ""old,"" I don't mean ""former."""
Insulting me is not gonna make me go away.,You're not here. Obviously I'm not trying to make you go away. Hint ï¿½ the answer is a number.
Is she serious?,"Well, she's certainly not funny. Put the phone down. Pick up the baby. Make us all happy."
BP's dropping.,Get it back up. I got a whole stack of these.
"Oh, that is so annoying. Can you make it stop?",Baby's crying is annoying you? What's her nerve conduction?
14.3. It's actually speeding up. But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.,That doesn't make any sense.
"Please, turn that phone off!","Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but ï¿½"
Can't dose her with anesthesia till the last batch completely clears.,How come the baby annoyed her?
Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.,What was different? Our Patient loves all things annoying.
She'd love this conversation.,"She's an earth mother, takes in the freaks and rejects of huManity and tells them they're a-okay. So what was different?"
"Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.","She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance."
Move your feet.,You decided to keep her. Thank you for telling me. You can go now.
I talked to her. We connected.,You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.
Are you trying to annoy me?,I'm trying to explain you.
"I know it doesn't make any sense, but it was real. It was there. You want to hold her? Come here. Come say hi.",You think we'll bond?
You think we'll bond?,Is that cute?
A little.,"If I threw up on you, you'd be pissed."
Your puke isn't as cute.,"That's 'cause of your hips. If she would've just gestated a little longer, her stomach sphincter would be fully mature. But, no, we have to walk upright, which means that baby's head is too big for mommy's hips. And by the way, your hips may be an evolutionary improvement. So we've evolved to find baby puke cute, 'cause otherwise we'd kill them all before they became functional. Bonding's over. I got to go see another baby."
Plenty of people live perfectly normal lives without ï¿½,Spleen's fine.
It's not her brain.,Of course it's her brain.
You looked at her brain. You took off her skull. You found nothing.,"Didn't look in the right part. Didn't look in the heart part. In the womb, blood has to bypass the lungs, since they don't work yet. When we're born, we take our first big breath, lungs expand, and the ductus closes. Yours didn't."
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.,"When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus. Blood takes a little detour, makes it leak from your nose, your stomach, your lungs, and, more significantly, keeps it flowing to the right side of your brain and away from your left. Which means that when you get stressed, you get unstressed. That's why you're so good with those annoying kids. And why, when your blood pressure dropped, you were able to identify Cuddy as an annoying huMan being. Good news is we can fix the heart. Bad news for the annoying kids."
"I know gas is expensive, but I could've given you a ride.",Elevator's broken.
"Dana Miller, the cancer researcher. Spontaneous pneumothorax.",Awfully thin file.
She just got admitted.,Lots of things can cause pneumothorax. Why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?
We wanna take this case. She's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.,Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.
We have a case?,Did you just get to work?
Am I in trouble?,Did you take the elevators up?
"So, steroids for asthma?",Yeah. Do a CT looking for hyperinflation to confirm.
Come here. Look at this. Come here.,Adorable. Elevators keep crashing. Is Mercury in retrograde or what?
Elevators can be capricious. Sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you. She keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?,Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?
"I don't know. Maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumbwaiter. But then they had to leave it at home with an elevator sitter, because you drove the replacement elevator to quitting because, you're incapable of listening to anybody but me. That's just a theory.",You're wrong. I don't Even listen to you. Either do your job or go home. Leave me out of it.
I am gonna do my job. It doesn't mean I have to do it happily. Doesn't mean I have to do it without resentment. And it definitely doesn't mean I have to do it without seeking vengeance on the person making me be here. Congratulations. You've officially dragged me down to your lEvel.,Okay.
Okay.,"Hey, Blue."
"Well, then, why are you a doctor? Why aren't you sitting by a pool in Fiji knocking back mai tais?",People act in their own self-interests. You're all here because you're happy to be here. Or at least because it's your best option.
I'm here because I want to help people.,"No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people. Taub and Foreman are here because they've got no other viable choices. And Thirteen is desperate to make her life matter before it's over."
So... you're happy to be here?,Does it show?
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.,"Do a biopsy. Foreman. ""You've got to look out for the people you care about."" That wouldn't have anything to do with you screwing over your clinical trial by slipping Thirteen the real drug would it?"
You said that would be stupid.,Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.
Your belly's full of blood.,"First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me afterï¿½"
You okay?,Great. Just practicing my clown college audition.
We were in the GRC.,"Lung, liver, go."
Shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?,Nope ï¿½ anybody bother MRIing our Patient's liver for tumors?
"If you're not obsessing, you must have already figured it out.",Yes. So I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our Patient's liver suddenly sprang a leak.
"There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe. Could be a granuloma. Erodes into the hepatic artery, causes the bleed.",What caused the granuloma?
"Blastomycosis. Could have been asymptomatic for months. It hits her lungs, we give her steroids. It blossoms and attacks her liver.","Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick Parkldren who need her soufflï¿½s can breathe easier."
"Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick Parkldren who need her soufflï¿½s can breathe easier.",Foreman.
Again?,You have a pRoblem.
"I told you, I didn't ï¿½",Then you really have a pRoblem. The way she turned her head to look at the MRI... I think she's losing her peripheral vision.
Because she turned her head?,"I'm happy for you. A love so deep you're ready to chuck your medical license to give her powerful, unproven drugs with dangerous side effects. I don't want to make any assumptions about your feelings for me, but I do have a birthday coming up."
I hear Cuddy's SEAL training finally came in handy. Should I be investing in a flak jacket?,You're safe.
"No carpet bombing? No burning of Dresden to teach her a lesson? Well, since you're incapable of taking the high road, I assume there's some deeper, more long-term strategy in effect.","Cuddy's not playing games. She's not looking for lEverage. She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance."
And your counter-move is to let her have it?,The only time to strike back is when I want something. All I want now is to get things back to normal. Which I can't get by escalating. The only way to win this war is to lose it. Let her punch herself out.
"Yeah, that makes sense too.","""Too""?"
"I was thinking you actually feel guilty about taking her away from her baby. But your explanation's good too. It's completely inconsistent with your character, but whatEver.","Oh, thank you, rationalization Man. You have saved the village. You wanna eat?"
You forgot your file. Dana Miller? The cancer researcher?,Not anymore.
"I did a free flap closure to avoid any scarring. She was lucky ï¿½ the scratParkng didn't cause any brain damage. But the first thing she said when we woke her up was, ""It still itches.""ï¿½","Itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin. Which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is."
"Why do you have to quit to do it? If I want to do something, I do it. If you can figure out a balance, there's no burnout.","Thanks for the lesson, Deepak. The itParkng started yesterday, not eight months ago. Meningitis, encephalitis..."
So would a brain tumor.,"Well, how 'bout we stop guessing and MRI her head instead?"
I don't remember demoting you.,"I brought you something. The latest issue of ""Parent""ï¿½ magazine. Really interesting column. Apparently, working moms are actually more engaged and attentive than stay-at-home moms. Something about personal fulfillment."
"That's just a rationalization by working moms to justify not being with their kids. Which is fine, if that's what they want. It's not what I want. And this is ""Nurses Quarterly.""ï¿½",The point is ï¿½
Where's your cane?,Where are your coworkers?
"Technically, it can't still be that, because it nEver could be that. She scratched through her skull while she was sleeping. Unless she was having a dream about fleas ï¿½","Oh, hey, funny you should drop by. We were just talking about this Patient of ours. Tell him the part about where two of her doctors don't show up ï¿½ Where are you going? Polyneuropathy. It's not in the brain, it's in the nerves. It explains the itParkng, the lungs, the liver. Shock the affected area, reboot the nerve ï¿½ she'll be fine."

She's got a tumor in her optic Parkasm.,You don't need your coat to treat a tumor.
I'm going to the drug company.,"To tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the Patient's health? That's a great idea."
"They have records on hundreds of Patients. I can ask them for access, find out if other Patients dEveloped tumors and how they were treated.",This drug inhibits cell death. I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.
Stop taking it? Yeah. She tried that yesterday.,"Oh, my God, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away? If you get on that elevator, and it's only 'cause you're worried about getting to sleep tonight ï¿½"
"I want to be able to tell her this happened to other people, and they're fine now.",So tell her.
I'm not gonna lie to her.,"A little late for that. You need to wait. Because if this thing doesn't go away, she's gonna need you to still have a medical license."
You gonna tip Housekeeping?,Get it from Cuddy.
Don't tell me ï¿½ she burned your apartment to the ground.,"Warmth would have been nice. No heat, no power. Apparently Mrs. House called the utilities and told them we were moving."
We've been paging you all night.,"By all means, let's discuss the failed attempts to contact me, not the reason behind them."
Patient started experiencing spinal shocks before the maParkne was turned on. L'Hermitte's sign.,"Shocks without shock, an itch that won't stop. She needs Dr. Seuss."
"L'Hermitte's sign could mean Behcet's, B-12 deficiency.","No sores, no anemia. Where's Foreman?"
Could be another demyelinating disease. Why are you asking about Foreman and not Thirteen?,Because both questions are bound to have the same answer. Ebony and ivory are joined near the hip. Forget the brain. Look lower.
But an aggressive spinal heMangioma could.,Go find it.
Go find it.,You didn't answer the door.
PRobably because I didn't want to talk to anyone. You can leave your stolen key on your way out.,I was looking for Foreman. I figured... You can't see. Where is he?
On his way to the drug company.,Tell him to come back. I'll dial.
If they can help.,"You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice."
"You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.",He asked for my advice before he switched you off the placebo. I told him to do it if he loved you.
He only thinks he loves me.,"It's the same thing. Yes, he's an idiot. You didn't ask him to do anything. You're pissed off that he did. So let him torch his career to pay for his sins. Unless, you actually feel something for the idiot. In which case, you might want to tell him to turn around."
What he does is who he is. And the same goes for you.,"Slow down. Unless you want to radiate her heart instead of her brain. Of course, then your pRoblems would actually all go away."
Thanks. I'm not beating myself up enough already over this. Entering the left common carotid.,You broke the rules. Girlfriend went blind. You gotta be ready for losing to be one of the possibilities. You're at the carotid bifurcation.
I knew that giving her the drug would be bad for me if I got caught. I nEver thought it would be bad for her. Nobody else was having adverse reactions.,"You did it because you love her. Ironically, you nEver took her into consideration. Can't wait to see what you get her for your anniversary. Catheter's adjacent to the optic Parkasm. We're in position. Nukey, nukey."
Classic mesothelioma. It metastasized outward to the spine and muscles.,"Ah, the irony of it. Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other lazy cancer researcher hadn't gone home early."
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?,"Shouldn't you be saying, ""Those weren't there when we scanned her two days ago?""ï¿½"
Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.,Good rephrasing. Have Wilson do a biopsy to confirm.
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.,So what causes masses that do bleed?
She'd be crawling with worms. We'd have noticed it. Gorham's disease and Kasabach-Merritt can both cause super-aggressive vascular tumors. Patient's heart just stopped.,So what causes that?
"We need to resect the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.",Too late ï¿½ no surgeon's gonna touch her now.
So we give up? Just let her bleed out?,Don't be silly. You know what that would do to our malpractice insurance rates? We go on the offensive. Cut off the invading army's supply line.
You're talking about embolization?,"Cut off the arteries that feed blood to the tumors, they wither and die. Start with the ones in her lungs. If they get any bigger, she's gonna have a hard time breathing. So she'll have a hard time telling us she's dead."
You can't kill the tumors without also killing healthy tissue. If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...,Let's hope that running marathons wasn't on her happy list.
"I found this. In the, uh, coat closet. Where I hid it.","Thought I'd nEver see you again. Little, little Greg. Yeah, you heard me right!"
"You are who you are. It's annoying, but... it's not your fault. It isn't about you. I! I! I'm sorry.",Because you were doing this job perfectly until the baby came along.
What? I'm apologizing. Can't you just accept my ï¿½,I accept. We gonna have to do this dance again in 28 days?
What the hell is wrong with you?,"Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're practically weeping on my shoulder. I can only assume that what I'm hearing is your aunt flow telling me..."
"When I was being a jerk, you suddenly act huMan. But when I act huMan, you turn back into a jerk.",Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.
"This is your way of saying you accept my apology, isn't it?","Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappy job before; you will do a slightly crappier job now. Everything keeps going. Nature of life. Nature of parenthood."
Or this whole thing is just an act. And you've gone back to the part you think you need to play.,"You should go talk to Wilson. Rationalization Man needs a faithful sidekick. Now, Rational Man needs to go save a life."
"House. If you're looking for returnable bottles, Kutner's already cleaned it out.","Damn! Oh, well. That means the only thing I'm gonna get out of this... Is a diagnosis."
So the nurses gave her pads instead of tampons. Is that diagnostically relevant?,Fact that the nurses had to give her anything is. Means she's bleeding from her uterus.
Women do that. It's perfectly natural. Not scary at all.,"She menstruating and, she's bleeding Everywhere. There's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance it's a coincidence. Which leaves a much bigger chance that the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis. She had a myoma eight months ago. Surgeons cut through her uterine wall. Every cut of the scalpel could have sent endometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream. Some of them took up residence in her lungs, some in her liver, some in her spine. And like all horny little cells, they went forth and multiplied till they reached a critical mass. In the days leading up to her next period, when her uterus is supposed to swell, Everything swelled. And when her uterus was supposed to bleed, Everything bled. Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period. Granted, it's the worst period Ever. Although, frankly, not by all that much. Cut out the masses, she'll be fine."
Can't do surgery until her cycle's over and she stops bleeding.,"Well, let's hope she can hold out till then. In the meantime, get her a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a DVD of ""Beaches""ï¿½."
"Dr. Schmidt. It's Foreman. Uh, actually, the trial isn't going too well.","You told them, didn't you? Well, you really had no choice... On account of being an idiot. They gonna pull the drug?"
"I broke protocol. Her results are no longer admissible to the trial. They don't have to do anything. Anyone else gets a tumor, they'll put a warning on the label.",Gonna keep your license?
They'll come after me if I attempt to participate in any more trials.,"That's very decent of them. Well, good for me. I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day."
"That wasn't your locker, was it?",It's a lock-er room. How else are they gonna learn?
You doing anything Friday?,Taking a lovely young lady to the Philharmonic.
That your way of saying you're having sex with a hooker?,Two. Can't create a harmonic with just one.
"Well, I was hoping you might be available for Rachel's Simchat Bat. It's a!","Jewish baby-naming ceremony, a time-honored tradition dating all the way back to the 1960s."
My House at 7:00. It'll just be the rabbi and a few friends and some family.,Nothing like welcoming a baby into the world with a completely naked display of hypocrisy.
There'll be plenty of wine and nice people you can quietly mock.,"Wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of Jell-O."
House! It's one Evening. I'd like you to be there.,"Religious hokum, get sponge bath. Can I get back to you?"
Can I help you?,Just browsing. Thanks. Happy to be underaParkeving again?
Running the ER is slacker heaven. Looking for anything in particular?,Not anymore. Where's this guy?
Why?,'Cause he's my next Patient. It'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.
He's a drunk priest who hallucinated Jesus.,Afraid you might have missed something?
Afraid you're wasting Everyone's time? It's obviously either alcohol or exhaustion.,So you admit you have no idea which?
I admit that I'm too busy to care who you're screwing with.,Don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.
You went out of your way to pick him? This is nothing.,There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?
There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?,Could be psychomotor epilepsy!
Could be alcohol. Shouldn't we let the ER rule the obvious out ï¿½,"Atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor."
You know something about this case you're not telling us?,Why would you think that?
Or screw with a hallucinating priest.,Both are possible. There's only one day to find out. Run an EEG for epilepsy. CT his brain for tumors. And go check his House Of God for toxins.
Both are possible. There's only one day to find out. Run an EEG for epilepsy. CT his brain for tumors. And go check his House Of God for toxins.,"Fourteen, hold up. This department is broken, and I'm not gonna take a real case until it's fixed. Job or relationship ï¿½ your choice."
What?,"To put it in terms you might better understand, if you don't split, you must quit."
"The drug trial is over. I'm out, she's out.",Don't care.
We're adults. We can handle this. You just have to give us a chance.,"No, you're not. No, you can't. And no, I don't. Mull it over. You got until the end of this fake case to decide."
"Well, it's just a job now. The fairy tale ended a long time ago.","You're a wuss ï¿½ part wimp, part puss."
I have no choice. I'm part of the ceremony.,I thought you were already circumcised.
It's one night for a friend.,What about the friend who has two tickets to Brubeck at the Blue Note?
I thought you had an orgy planned.,I lied.
Are you lying about the Brubeck tickets?,"Yes, but only to save you from yourself."
"I'll be fine, and so will Cuddy if you don't show up. I'm surprised she Even invited you.",It is oddly flattering.
Nothing.,Cool.
It's cool he's a Parkld molester?,It's cool the priest doesn't beliEve in God. It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid.
Allegedly.,You think he's innocent?
He had honest eyes?,"And you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him."
"If Everybody lies, that includes teenage boys.",Aren't we lucky to have such an interesting Patient?
Had ï¿½ there's nothing wrong with him.,"The world's most boring case just became a page turner, you want to tear out the last chapter?"
"You want to examine his character, go to a soup kitchen. We are done testing him for things he doesn't have.",Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen.
Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen.,Case is over.
We're not splitting up.,So which one of you is taking a hike?
And neither of us is quitting.,Interesting.
You were fine with Chase and Cameron dating. You obviously don't actually have an issue ï¿½,You're fired.
How long are you gonna keep this up? We know you're not ï¿½,"Wrong. Again. In fact, in the last few weeks, it's hard to remember a correct call you made. If Chase had compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron, I'd have fired his ass, too."
"When my mistake blew up, you did Everything to keep me from contacting the drug company.","To save your license, not your job, and definitely not your relationship. So, badge."
Fine.,Why don't you see if you can find us a real case.
Your toe just fell off.,"Must be my lucky day. New symptom means the old symptom was a real symptom, and I get to keep our pederast priest after all."
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?,They left.
They left.,Leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.
Why would they leave?,"Because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and Thirteen is mad that I fired him. Don't worry. She'll be back. She'll be pissed off. She'll want to take a stand. And then Foreman will convince her that there's no reason both of them should be out of a job."

Why'd you fire Foreman?,I gave him a choice ï¿½ split or quit. He chose neither. What about ergotism?
He's giving up his career for her?,"He's giving up this career for her. No, normal white blood count. Carbon monoxide poisoning?"
They're good doctors.,"Separately, they're great doctors, better than you. Together, they're morons. Go check out the House that they would've checked had this been a real case. And page Thirteen, tell her to run the blood for CO. And get the priest in a hyperbaric chAmber before anything else falls off."
You can buy a shovel.,"Let's see! How do I keep House from ruining my precious display of religious hypocrisy? I know, I'll pressure him to attend, knowing that he'll nEver agree to anything I actually want him to do."
I didn't pressure you. I invited you. And there's nothing hypocritical about recognizing your heritage.,"So you keeping kosher now, wearing four-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god Ra? Wait, is that one your people? Do it all, do nothing, or option ""C"" ï¿½ you're a liar and a hypocrite."
"House, for better or for worse, you are a part of my life. It isn't a ploy. It's a sincere invitation. I honestly want you to come.",Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Chest pain wasn't angina. EKG ruled out heart attack.,"So the good news is, he didn't have a heart attack. The bad news is, I apparently fired the only guy who actually knows what a heart attack looks like. So the Man of God who doesn't beliEve in God had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack. Do I know how to pick awesome cases or what? Could be a clotting disorder."
"Three different symptoms, three different clots?","I know. How cool is that? You two do an angio. You don't want to work, so why don't you just go get me a lottery ticket? The sicker he gets, the luckier I feel."
Where are you going?,I've been wanting to introduce myself.
I've been wanting to introduce myself.,Are you really a virgin?
You have to treat me. You don't have to beliEve me.,"And before we treat you, we have to diagnose you. Not knowing whether we can beliEve you is making that difficult."
Everything I've told you is true.,You lost your faith because a teenager got confused?
"Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning. Life's meaningless without free will. With free will, there's always suffering. So, God wants suffering. I got tired of that argument before I Even finished saying it. And Even if I bought that, what the hell is God doing? You know just the big stuff? The acts of God, the hurricanes, the earthquakes, the random killings of millions of innocent people. Then we better damn pray.","God, I wish you weren't a pedophile."
No. Why?,Because there should be. You feel that?
Regional anesthesia is a new symptom.,"Not if the chest pain is related to the numbness. It's not circulatory. It's neurological. Run a nerve-conduction study. And be careful. If you kill him, he'll be dancing with the dark one."
Why the hell are you going to Cuddy's baby naming? It's a religious ceremony. It's boring. Why waste a good Evening that could be much better spent in a drunken stupor feeling sorry for yourself?,Okay.
"Okay? Okay, you won't go?","Okay, your obligation to Cuddy is fulfilled."
Why are you doing this?,Why did Hillary conquer Everest?
"You always have a reason. It's usually a bad one, but a reason.",She's being Parkldish.
"See, that's an example from the bad Category. Is it resentment? The stork brought home a new baby, and you don't want to share mommy? Or you just can't stand to see others happy?","She's trying to play me. If I let her succeed, the terrorists win."
He'd be brimming with white blood cells.,Or we are at the back stage door of a Duran Duran concert. Hundreds of screaming girls clustered around. What does that mean?
That girls like rock bands.,"The presence of the fans indiCates the presence of the band. Different night ï¿½ same band, same door. Now there's not a girl in sight. What does that mean?"
They weren't a hair band. They were new roMantics. The band already left?,"Nope, the band's still there, still rocking out. When does the absence of the fans not indiCate the absence of the band?"
When it's 2009. There aren't any Duran Duran fans.,"They don't make 'em anymore. If there's no infection, it's because there aren't any fans, no white cells."
"You think, his spleen?","Why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out? Yes, I think it's his spleen. Go get a biopsy. I'll try to get ""New moon on Monday"" out of my head."
"Why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out? Yes, I think it's his spleen. Go get a biopsy. I'll try to get ""New moon on Monday"" out of my head.",Why are you talking this time?
"If I quit, will you rehire Foreman?",Why?
He can't find another job. I can.,And you're willing to make that sacrifice for him?
Yes.,Does Foreman know about this plan?
Yes.,"Well, if he's okay with it, who am I to say no?"
You think it's my spleen?,"That's what they're testing. So if I happen to cure you, what happens then? You start thinking that God was working through me? This is some sort of miracle?"
Do you think I'm an idiot?,That's what I'm testing.
Losing my faith wasn't a choice I made. It happened. It's gone. For good.,"But if it can magically disappear, it can magically reappear, and that's what you're hoping. Your job!"
Sucks.,"That's my point. You can make more money frapping decafs, and yet you're still ministering to the meek. Why do the lord's work if the lord has left the building?"
I've been with the church my entire adult life. It's my only marketable skill.,I detect the stink of leftover faith.
"You want to talk hypocrisy, what about you? You act like you don't care about anyone, but here you are saving lives.",Solving puzzles. Saving lives is just collateral damage.

"You were right. I don't want you there. It's a special occasion filled with love and acceptance, and the last thing I need is someone there who's filled with loathing and contempt.",Okay.
That's it? You're really not coming?,I'm really not coming.
Thank you.,"You're welcome. Gosh, I feel so grown up."
Which minor bugs?,Why do people suddenly find religion when they have kids?
Fear of the unknown. Cornerstone of faith. I think it makes perfect sense.,So it makes sense because it doesn't make sense.
"The fact that you're railing about it doesn't make a lot of sense. You really got a thing for your boss, huh?",I've got a thing for my boss's thing. She doesn't have a thing! per se. I'm big on metaphors. What about you? 29 years of celibacy. What's holding you back now?
Who wants a relationship with a priest?,Who wants a relationship?
"But he has pneumocystis, a harmless bug that's Everywhere and nEver makes anyone sick, unless they have a compromised immune system.",So father Nietzsche has AIDS.
"Yeah, heaven forbid a diddler has job issues.",And you get brought up on charges. I've lost enough doctors this week. Treat him for AIDS.
Don't you hate when they put the mushrooms underneath the cheese?,"Your attendance is validating her hypocrisy. If she invited you to a ceremonial lynParkng, would you go?"
It would depend on what she was serving. Everyone's a hypocrite. Why are you suddenly so obsessed with Cuddy's particular brand?,Just making conversation. Would you rather we go back to talking about mushrooms and cheese?
You're the hypocrite! You want to go! You don't resent this baby. You wanna be a part of it.,"Yes, but not until her 16th birthday! in some states."
"This is ridiculous. You two deserve each other. If you wanna go, just go and act like a huMan being.","Wow, solid advice, except for two things. I'm acting like I don't wanna go because I don't wanna go, and! I am incapable of acting like a huMan being."
I want my job back.,"Love, sacrifice, deception, and now betrayal. This is better than a telenovela."
What going on?,"Well! either Foreman is here, as the two of you discussed, to beg for his job back in exchange for me dumping you, or! nothing."
And you're not being controlling right now?,Yeah! Who's the controlling bitch now?
You're an idiot.,"Well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back."
"Well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back.",Welcome back.
"Yeah, he reacted by getting worse. Means it's not AIDS.",So went Satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote Job sore with boils.
You think it's hyper-IgE syndrome?,"I prefer the colloquial term ""Job syndrome."" Explains the symptoms, and my quote."
This isn't gonna work.,Are you kidding? I've nEver felt more alive. Conflict breeds creativity. Go run the genetic tests.
Any second thoughts about Cuddy?,"Nope. But please, feel free to blather on."
"Raising a Parkld on her own is scary. She's just doing what you do, what Everyone does ï¿½ trying to avoid pain.",Religion is not the opiate of the masses. Religion is the placebo of the masses. If you're saying she's not a hypocrite ï¿½
I'm not. I'm trying to give you a rational reason to overlook her hypocrisy so you don't feel like a hypocrite for going.,"Oh, sorry. Continue."
Are you eliminating symptoms?,We can know Everything.
This is medicine not metaphysics.,Truth is truth. It fits.
It doesn't fit. You can't eliminate a symptom.,I can if it's not a symptom.
"Well, what is it?",Not a symptom.
Not a symptom.,"You're not gonna die. You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. It impairs your immune system, makes you susceptible to all the AIDS stuff without actually having AIDS. And you didn't catch it. You were born with it. Another gift from God."
You sure?,"Genetic test should confirm it, but it explains all your symptoms ï¿½ toe, chest, eyes, skin."
What about my hallucination?,Scotch explains that.
But that was just a coincidence.,Coincidences do happen.
That coincidence is what brought me to you in the first place.,You promised you wouldn't go there.
"Einstein said, ""coincidence is a God's way of remaining anonymous.""","A Woman in Florida said, ""look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich."""
You didn't Even want to take my case. You didn't Even think I was sick.,The fact that I was wrong is not a proof of God.
I'm just trying to understand how my life could completely turn around in a single day.,Don't worry. Your life will go back to sucking soon enough. Everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.
You want him there tonight. You should tell him.,It's cold out there.
At least you have shoes that cover your toes.,So it's tonight?
"Yep. Bad weather for it, huh?",Maybe you'll get lucky. Maybe your sister will decide the roads are too dangerous to drive on.
Fingers crossed.,Have fun.
Like House is going to find out we faked our breakup because of your shoes? Go with the boots.,You gonna eat that?
Did you just ask my permission before you took my food?,Yes we can.
"Adolescent genetic mosaic collapsed during a basketball game, presenting with persistent pelvic pain.",Fun!

That was easy.,"Our new Patient, part girl, part boy, all Thirteen's dream date."

"You're Dr. House, aren't you? What do you think is wrong with our son?","These people were just coming to tell you. This is better, don't have to worry about them losing their way."
"We think that he has a blind uterus, he should have an MRI.",Did you send them a text?
"Over the past Thirteen years, we've eduCated ourselves.","Well, who needs med school when you've got Wi-Fi? Go schedule their son for an MRI with contrast right away."
You just said an MRI was a waste of time.,So's arguing with them.
You're okay with this?,With what?
"That we're considering a diagnosis unrelated to this kid being a shemale. Assuming a coincidence like that would usually torture you, but you're completely unfazed.","Completely unfazed? You think I'm totally lacking in any fazing? The idea that I'm anything less than half-fazed, I actually find offensive. It greatly fazes me."
He started testosterone ï¿½,Vitamins
"A few months ago. That can cause autoimmune diseases like Polyarteritis and SLE, which can cause pericardial effusion and pelvic pain. So it is related.",Now I'm unfazed. Start him on corticosteroids for the autoimmune and Finasteride to block the vitamins.
"You want us to tell a sick adolescent boy that he's really not an adolescent boy. That doesn't seem simpler to me. No, just, give him the meds.","So, you have pain in one arm and both your legs. Does it hurt right now?"
"No, its, when, I like put pressure on them. See, it hurts when I do this, Ow, and this, Ow, and this, Ow.",How about this?
"Heart's still working that means synapsis is still firing, we just need to get a message through.",Aaahh!
What the hell is going on?,I think my penis stopped breathing; do you know CPR?
"Looks like your brain is Okay. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive.","I'm fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple. No wonder you broke up with him. I'm surprised yours are still attached."
"I'm fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple. No wonder you broke up with him. I'm surprised yours are still attached.","By the way, I can see that from here. I assume those are our Patient's lab results."
The only reason you'd ignore a near death experience is you don't care or you already know why it happened.,"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many."
"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many.",Can I please get some information about our Patient?
I don't remember you taking any Vicodin today.,I don't remember hiring my Mother. What causes the enzymes in little Boy George's existing heart pRoblem and pelvic pain?
You didn't take any yesterday at breakfast either.,I don't remember having breakfast with my Mother.
"Protein lEvels are normal. This kid's depressed, if he's self-medicating with drugs and alcohol that would explain his symptoms.",Search the school; search the home.
"Seriously, or are you just deflecting?",Both.
Where are you going?,"Nowhere, I'm staying right here, so we can properly discuss this."
"""A pain that tears and bites and will not bend, only when I sleep, will it end.""ï¿½","Downer, and medically irre!"
If he's faking you think he's going to come clean because you said his name?,Back off. Only Thirteen gets to grab my nipples this time.
That is sweet that you're worried about House.,"Unless the next stanza reads, ""Hoping to fry my brain to death, I smoked some primo crystal meth,""ï¿½ I'm not interested."
You can't deny that this kid may be suicidal.,We're not here to make him happy; we're here to diagnose him.
"Well that would certainly explain the inappropriate responses. I gotta go. Okay. sorry, consult.",When did you order these?
You off bourbon? We can get you something else.,I came here expecting a burger. Figured I'd have to endure a little lecture on moderation.
You nEver listen. So why ï¿½,"Instead, I get a drink; a nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stop working."
You seem fine now.,"You don't beliEve that I OD'd on Vicodin. You figure I'm on something stronger, and because you can nEver, Ever assume anything but the most screwed up scenario as far as I'm concerned ï¿½"
Funny how I'm usually right.,You think that I'm on Heroin. This is your version of a tox screen. Because if I am on Heroin; I can't drink that without risking another bout of not breathing.
Well?,Goodnight.
You idiot!,"Okay, I admit it. I have bulimia. I look good though, don't I?"
"Heroin. Heroin! House, of all the stupid ï¿½",I'm not on heroin.
I just caught you with your fingers down your throat.,I'm on methadone. Stupid product. Heroin without the high.
"Yeah, and twice the risk of death.",But no risk of arrest.
You nearly died.,Today was a fluke. I nodded off.
"Right, you're safe as long as you nEver sleep again. Mistime your dose, you die. Couple of drinks, you die. Mix it with the wrong drugs, you die. You want to detox from Vicodin? Pick something that won't kill you.",I'm not detoxing.
If you're looking for something to help with your pain ï¿½,"Doesn't help my pain, it eliminates it. My leg doesn't hurt anymore."
"You still breathing in there? 'Cause if not, I'm sending in janitorial.","I'm not breathing, but it's strictly voluntary. Should've seen the guy who was in here before me."
I know about the methadone.,It's legal. I have a prescription.
WhatEver doctor you conned into writing it clearly had no idea about your addiction issues ï¿½ Your lack of ï¿½,He knows I'm in pain. What I put in my body is my business.
"You keep taking this, you could die.","If you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business."
"I can't sit by and watch you kill yourself. As long as you're in my hospital, you can't do methadone.",I'll send someone for my stuff.
"That's it, you're quitting? You're choosing methadone over this job?",I'm choosing lack of pain over this job.
Who was she?,I hired her to watch me sleep ï¿½ make sure I don't stop breathing.
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.,She's not a nurse.
You hired a hooker to watch you sleep? That just can't,"Surprisingly, hookers are cheaper. And they don't sue for sexual harassment. Which one?"
"You, shaved.",The red one then.
You have two ties?,Meeting at St. Sebastian's today. Gonna try and talk 'em into starting up a diagnostics department.
Sounds great. I just came by to check up on you. See how you were doing.,I'm fine.
Which means it's not scleroderma.,"I have an interview, in two hours."
Wow.,Hand over my letter of recommendation.
"Sorry, I haven't done it yet.",You have no right to sabotage ï¿½
"I was busy with this. It's a list of requirements for your methadone treatment. Weekly drug tests. Supervised doses administered on a precise schedule, by me, or, one of the nurses.","Seems weird, getting my meds here when I'm working somewhere else."
Yes. I'm offering you your job back.,I want a raise.
No.,And a bigger office... but in the same spot.
No. We both know this is where you belong.,Okay.
Welcome back.,Thank you.
You okay?,I have issues with authority. You?
We thought you were gone.,Cuddy missed me.
And what happened to your cane?,She asked to borrow it for some reason. Patient dead or do I need to do anything?
It's not scleroderma.,"Wow. Two days, and you've already got two separate theories."
Which rules out scleroderma.,When did you two come up with this?
We ran into each other in the lobby.,"So, what did we miss? When I say ""we"" I mean ""you,"" since I wasn't here."
We've ruled out Zollinger-Ellison.,That was a dumb idea.
Why?,Because it was wrong.
"Also toxoplasmosis, dehydration, SLE, various intersex disorders.","Oh, crap. This kid like energy drinks?"
But energy drinks don't explain ï¿½,Nice work.
"So, we're okay?",Why wouldn't we be? Nice heels.
Why wouldn't we be? Nice heels.,This is all your parents' fault.
Excuse me?,"Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice?"
"Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice?",Your son came in here with simple dehydration. That's why he collapsed during the game.
The ER treated him for that. It didn't help the pain.,That's where the energy drinks came in. They put a strain on his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.
Then why isn't he better?,"That's where your idiocy came in. Before we could give him another glass of water, you two insisted I do an MRI. So, I go down a blind alley looking for a blind uterus. And my team injects him with contrast material. If his kidneys had been healthy, they would've filtered out the contrast in a couple hours. Since they weren't, it went around and around, Eventually getting absorbed by his heart, his liver, and his pancreas; getting in trouble Everywhere it went. Your son was fine when he got here. It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him."
Nearly?,"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine."
"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.",You gave birth to a freak of nature. Doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one.
"Starting tomorrow, you'll come to my office for your fix.",I'm done with the methadone. I screwed up.
The kid's parents wanted that MRI.,I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway. That's what got him sick.
You just solved a case that no one else could solve.,"I created a case. I played nice because, I was in a good mood because, I didn't hurt."
You don't need your pain to be a good doctor.,I'm not interested in good.
You're afraid to be happy.,Why do you care if I'm happy?
"You're afraid of change. The one thing you have is your intellect. You think if that's compromised, you have nothing. Just take it.",No.
Don't do this.,It's already done. This is the only me you get.
Cameron brought this up from the ER.,Doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.
"It's Phineas Gage, the most famous case study in medical history.",You're telling me this Patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe?
Gage was a different person after the spike. Argumentative. Impulsive.,Whereas our guy became a different person after Chardonnay.
"He was sober when they brought him in. There's also the nosebleed, the collapse.",MRI show anything?
Nothing.,Good. What fun would that be? So the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood. It's cool neighborhood adjacent.
A well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity eroding into the brain could do the damage.,Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose. See what you find.
"Make this go away. God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?",Wednesday night. Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator.
I can't.,Let me rephrase. Low-down-blue-meanie ï¿½
"I understand monster truck code. Do you understand ""can't""?","Not when it follows ""low-down-blue-meanie."" Is the world coming to an end Tuesday night? Otherwise, Wednesdayï¿½"
"All right, it's not ""can't."" It's ""don't want to."" The fact is, I just don't like monster trucks.","Yes, you do."
"No, I don't.",You've always liked monster trucks.
"No, you've always liked them. I've tolerated them.",What are you hiding?
Luckily jerkiness is a temporary condition for this guy.,"No, it's not. We may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them."
"But he's also gonna be the guy who doesn't say them. If he spent his whole life constructing this nice guy persona, isn't that as much who he really is as anything else?",You would argue that. You're all persona.
"I agree with Wilson. This guy's a Harry Potter. The sorting hat was going to put Harry in Slytherin based on his nature. He refused, so he ended up in Gryffindor, through choice.",There's damage somewhere in his brain. Go find it.
Your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.,You're welcome.
That was for my benefit?,You're 40 years old!
38,The administrator of a hospital!
Dean of medicine.,"People don't get personal with you. Except for me, and you dismiss me as a jerk who's jerking you around. But that guy can only tell the truth. And he prefers your body to that of a smoking young hottie."
So that was your way of saying I look good today.,You didn't get the slightest kick out of that?
Just proving a point.,Anyone sitting here?
Just my persona.,"You know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults. Or what they think are insults."
So that wasn't an insult?,"I'm not suggesting that, like our Patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive niceness."
I'm not always nice. I'm not nice to you.,"Because you know nice bores me. Hence, still nice. No, I'm suggesting that you have no core. You're what whoEver you're with needs you to be. Okay, I guess that could be insulting. The interesting question is why. Why do you think the world will end in chaos and destruction if you're not there to save it?"
"Because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, ""James, you will grow to Manhood under a yellow sun.""",And why'd you lie about monster trucks?
I didn't.,"I checked your appointment book. You got tomorrow night marked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing. So you thought someone might look at the book ï¿½"
"I'm playing racquetball tomorrow night, with Taub.",Why would you hide that?
"Because the world revolves around you. I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.",You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.
We know it's not systemic sclerosis.,"Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go."
The CBC showed normal white blood cells.,So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter has a neurological condition.,"First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew. You're not athletic. Run to the end of the hall and back. I'll time you."
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.,"Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. Gets old."
"There are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters. We can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.",Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?
It's both.,You suspected that was a trick question.
But I could have said neither. Diabetes makes more sense.,We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.
He's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.,"Yes, that's why we should not test him for it. Test the daughter. Kutner runs the nerve test. Taub, you may be right about the diabetes. Take supper away from our Patient and run a glucose tolerance test. Oh, and the nurses have been working so hard. You can do the blood draws yourself."
They have to be done Every couple hours. You're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.,That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess Everything.
Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition.
Seems to be dead. Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition while hitting this against the wall. This is the only place we can do both.
I finished the last blood draw.,I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge. Unless they don't expect to work for me.
Last blood draw was at 6:00 AM. Sugar lEvels nEver rose above 120 all night.,So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.
I still think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.,So you're going for thyroid instead of pancreas? Makes sense.
Fine. I'm not playing racquetball with Wilson. I was nEver playing racquetball with Wilson. I thought it would be helpful if a Department Head owed me a favor. But it's not worth this.,"Not bad. You put on a good show. You studied up. Wilson actually booked a court. If you were really a racquetball player, you'd know that you were holding a squash racket. Tell Kutner to do a thyroid reuptake scan, I'll go grab a nap in one of the on-call rooms."
"What kind of infection? It could be anything; Staph aureus, tuberculosis, strongyloides!","Go back to Phineas, get a history."
We've got a history. He hasn't been out of the country.,Get a detailed history.
No one at home is sick. No one at work is sick. There's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.,Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something.
Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something.,Not you. Kutner can do it. You're gonna be busy with something else.
"Guy leads a boring life. They stay home a lot. No travel, no exotic pets, no nearby standing water.",You sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?
"His wife rescues dogs. Among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the House. Our Patient hates it.",Was the wife there to hear this?
No.,Too bad. Keep going.
The dog marks his territory all over the living room. I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach. He said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.,The dog was fixing the television?
Yes.,The Patient's eyes red?
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.,"Bacterial. He lucked out. Start him on doxycycline. If he improves, we'll know we were right."
I told Wilson you sent me to get information.,"And now you're telling me. What does that make you, a quadruple agent?"
He let me print out his e-mails.,Wow. Excellent. Information he wants us to have. Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails?
No.,Then go back there ï¿½
"As long as I was sitting there, I thought I'd print 'em anyway. Top one's the one you're looking for.",Writing to confirm Wednesday at 7:00 PM.
It's out going to jgonzalez@nymercy.net. There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology. It's a consult.,"Secret consult, 7:00 PM. Oh, Joan is perky."
You're wrong. There was a Patient file attached.,Where?
It was password-protected.,"No. Wilson doesn't password-protect his Patient files. I'm the only one he'd expect Ever to look there, and he knows there's only one Patient I'd want to check on."
You think Wilson's sick?,"If Wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to Manhattan. He could pull strings here and get the best treatment. Six articles by Gonzalez. ""Managing suicidal thoughts in oncology Patients,"" ""Suicidal ideation in Parkldren with leukemia."""
"I don't want to ask this, but, have you Ever had reason to think he might be depressed?",No. Get out of here.
Get the hell out of my room.,"Your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk."
Is there an emergency?,I don't know. Is there? You nEver take a walk unless you've got something you need to think about.
Maybe you just don't have a good statistical sampling of my walks.,"The other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office. Apparently, this is something you can only discuss with Gonzalez at New York Mercy."
Taub. another graduate of the House school of being a dick.,Private dick.
"Look, I'd love to stay for the full inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.","Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?"
You're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?,"Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you. You could have come back, but you didn't. You chose to be uncomfortable. Now, why would someone choose that? Because they hate themselves?"
Nick Greenwald. I hear you're the guy in charge. I'm the Patient with the disinhibition.,"If you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away."
"Oh, I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.","Oh, all the more reason to go away."
They're talking about sending me home. To what? A life where I'll continually drive away anyone who might for a second care about me?,Those are the breaks.
You could operate.,You could die.
"So I'm either better or dead? I'm okay with that. I ï¿½ I've always been kind of a! an imPatient guy. But I've worked hard to keep my mouth shut. I've made my wife happy. I've made my little girl happy. I want that back. Otherwise, it's no life.",I want you to remove a small pRoblem.
I'm not a neurosurgeon.,But your boss is. You could assist. I'm sure you'd like to add to your resume.
It's too near the brain stem. Nobody's gonna touch it.,"Your boss would. He's an egoManiac. I know 'cause I keep seeing him at the club. He just needs a little push. I'm sure by now you've kissed his ass sufficiently. Would you like me to phrase it as ""you're politically gifted""? I can do that."
You want me to help you? Tell me why.,Why what?
Why you care. The puzzle's solved. The guy's alive. And the odds of coming out of this surgery with that same status aren't that great.,My Patient has a quality of life issue.
"He says awful things, hardly a medical condition.","When he leaves here, he's going to lose his family. He's gonna alienate the people he works with. And if he Ever finds a friend who's willing to put up with his crap, he'll be lucky. Until he drives them away too."
I'll see what I can do.,You've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.
I may have overreacted.,You definitely overreacted.
I knew you'd meet me halfway.,"It made me think. You only snap on one subject: losing people. So I went back to the intel. It's true there's only one doctor named Gonzalez at New York Mercy, but there's a Javier Gonzalez who's a nurse in the psych ward. And who could you lose who'd end up there?"
Maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.,"Daniel Wilson. Once you got a name, it's amazing how much stuff you can learn on the phone. I mean, if you're a doctor and you lie freely. They found your brother sleeping in the lobby of an office building in Manhattan. Got aggressive when they asked him to leave, and the cops took him to the Mercy psych ward."
"There have been new anti-psychotics dEveloped since he ran away. He's been on them for a couple of days, and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.",But you're not sure if he wants to.
"I'll be in New York in a few hours, and I guess I'll find out.",Why wouldn't you tell me this?
"House, you and I! We don't have the normal social contract. I don't expect you to tell me the lies ï¿½",I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.
"I mean, collaborative lies. Giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves, just a little. For two days I've been thinking about how Danny's gonna react when he sees me. If I said that to anybody else, they'd say, ""don't worry, it'll all be all right."" You wouldn't.",Because it might all go horribly wrong.
"Yeah. Yeah, it might.","In which case, you might want some company."
Feel free to send him an IM.,You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.
"13 years ago. I used to go to Princeton whenEver I could. I must have hit Every homeless shelter in town. And then one day, I'm just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich, I look out the window, and there he is. He was gone by the time I got outside.",That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.
That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?,They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid.
We'll find out.,"The spell-correct on Kutner's phone has got a hair trigger. Either that, or the Patient has a ""cyclone in the floral of his lungs.""ï¿½ You took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind."
Go ahead.,"I think you were punishing yourself. I think you wanted to feel what it would be like be homeless in a New Jersey winter. That tells me, guilt. That tells me, something happened."
"The sParkzophrenia started when he was a teenager. When he was in college! He was on meds, but he'd still think a professor was out to get him because he got a B, or he'd fight with his roommates because he nEver showered.",Where were you?
"Med school. He, called me, Every day. Talked for hours. I didn't have hours.",Interesting. Later for that. Go on.
"I was tired of being the guy that Everybody counted on, so one night, Danny called ï¿½ One night, Danny called, crying, upset about something. I had to study for an exam. So I ï¿½ I hung up! Took my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.",I wonder how that turned out?
"My mother called me the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind. Which I knew meant that he would nEver be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.","So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down. And because we're wired to find meaning in semi-random Events, you decided nEver to be that careless again."
You don't think that's a little facile?,"Actually, I don't. I think you did it consciously. You dEveloped your people-pleasing talents the way an Olympic athlete dEvelops his muscles. Talk about an overreaction to a single Event."
It was a pretty big Event.,"Hanging up the phone? That's what you're blaming all this on. That's the behavior you've been trying to correct. As though nothing else went wrong in your brother's life. Of course, he overreacted too but! His glucose was normal?"
"We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?",It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.
"Since this is a significant moment in my life and all, I!",Yeah.
I think I'll just go in then.,Explain that.
Right.,"You'd given him steroids. His glucose should have been elevated. That wannabe cyst you found in the whole body scan; without the glucose, it's an irrelevant cyst. With the glucose, it's a relevant fibroma. He has Doege-Potter syndrome."
It doesn't explain the organ failure or the brain damage.,"This whole thing is an overreaction. That one small fibroma. It's benign, but his body's acting like it's an invader. His antibodies went to war against it and got carried away, attacked his other systems. Take out the fibroma, he'll be a happy hypocrite again in no time."
I'm sure she's moved on. Kids are so resilient.,You okay?
I'll be seeing Danny again next week. I'd like you to meet him.,Sure. He sounds interesting. Go on.
"I thought seeing him again would change Everything. It would be wonderful or terrible. Instead! we're just strangers. It's kind of, anticlimactic.",Which is better than terrible.
Go on.,Does it bother you that we have no social contract?
"My whole life is one big compromise. I tiptoe around Everyone like they're made of Parkna. I spend all my time analyzing: What will the effect be if I say this? Then there's you. You're a reality junkie. If I offered you a comforting lie, you'd smack me over the head with it. Let's not change that.",Okay.
"No, see, this ï¿½ if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because! It makes me feel better!",It is kind of fun watParkng you torture yourself.
Do you think things will work out with my brother?,"No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault."
"Thanks, House.",You do actually like monster trucks?
"You have a Patient waiting, see?",I'm waiting for a follow-up.
I had colds all winter.,"I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right?"
I feel run-down like maybe something big is coming on.,"Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?"
No.,Runny nose?
"No. I know it sounds weird, I'm a nurse, but could you run maybe a CBC or thyroid up ï¿½","Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult. Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on."
She's urinating on herself.,She's having a seizure. If she hadn't peed it would!
It's green.,Interesting.
Interesting.,35-year-old Woman. Head of nursing at an old age home.
"""Neuro"" is also written in green. Does that mean she has green neurological symptoms as well?",From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indiCates irony.
Why are we taking this case?,"Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing."
"Sorry I'm late. And, yes, green pee does meet the only diagnostic requirement you care about! it's interesting. But is it worth us taking this case?","""Us"" aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting."
"Okay, I accept. She has adult-onset epilepsy, and she really likes those Saint Patrick's Day beers.",Go check out the House and the office for toxins and infections.
Her neuro exam was normal. No subsequent seizures. It's not life-threatening. It's not important.,"Luckily, neither are you."
"You got conned. Methylthioninium chloride. Notable side effect, green urine. She's a nurse. She knows the dosage. Knows how to fake a seizure. She pees pea soup and gets the warm attention of doctors all week long. She's a Munchausen and you're her mark.",So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.
No good reason it'd be sitting in her desk.,You Ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.
"Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat. We peed in private.",For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her pRoblem is phenol.
"Carbolic acid? Yeah, maybe she accidentally inhaled some at a gout treatment facility circa 1890.",It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.
She'd have to drink five bottles a day.,Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her House. Bye. And you can start her on charcoal hemoperfusion for the phenol poisoning. Seriously?
"Oh, you were lying about the throat spray. That does make more sense. So why are you wasting Taub's time?",Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory. Zip.
Hi. Tests back?,Head CT was negative.
What about a thyroid uptake or abdominal ultrasound?,Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?
You want me to have another seizure?,We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem.
Okay.,Dammit.
"Please forgive me, I'm so sorry.",What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.
I'm not a Munchausen. I'm gonna die unless you help me.,You'll have to come up with something more original.
A cat predicted my death.,"Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed."
"A few years back, I was one of them. Good luck, Neil.","If you're going to kill me and rape me, please do it in that order."
"This is the cat, Debbie. Have you heard of her?","Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name!"
"She was in the news. We found her as a kitten. She lives in the nursing home. She only sleeps next to people when they're about to die. Ten Patients in the last year. And then yesterday she did it to me while I was sitting on my couch. Please, the whole staff, the doctors Even, we all know this is real.",Can you come back later? I have some business I'm conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.
"Just watch this video. It'll prove I'm not lying. Dr. House, I am begging you. Chest.",Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.
House.,She's faking. The cat told me.
"Debbie the cat spends most of her time just prowling the halls, the queen of her own private world.","Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me."
You want to treat her? She's a nut job.,Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us huMan?
The doctors we spoke to also agree!,Nut jobs get sick too.
So you think this cat story is nonsense. And you admit she faked her earlier symptoms. But you still think she's actually sick now?,"Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice."
Confirm she's faking or I'm gonna have to kick her out.,There's that voice again.
I'll give you 24 hours.,Consecutive?
What are you doing?,"No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die. Bronchospasm, go."
"No cough, no fEver, and Blofeld didn't smoke a cigar.","He might have. Dude had a lair. Means he was rich. Rich people enjoy a good stogie, sometimes send them as gifts. Hey, Taub! Did that sound like I was awkwardly trying to segue into making a point?"
"Lungs were clean on the CT. Dogs can be trained to predict diabetic comas, epileptic seizures; they can smell cancer. It is possible there's something in this cat.",It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything. Might have caused the deaths.,We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.
"Yeah, it could be cat scratch fEver or visceral larva migrans. Maybe he didn't kill Everyone at the nursing home, but it may be killing Morgan.",The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.
Those cigars were for me.,"Hey, that reminds me, why is some fancy CEO sending you a box of Cuban cigars? Is it related to your money worries?"
What money worries?,"Extrapolating from the fact that he's been skipping his morning muffin, I'd say that he lost almost all his money on the market last year."
I'm on a diet.,I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolio you forget to log off. But it's mostly the muffins. Scope her for worms in the lungs.
There are no worms in the lungs.,What else could cause bronchospasm?
Why are you pushing a crash cart?,"Because Patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways."
You actually think the cat is going to predict someone's death?,"No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved!"
"You didn't keep this Patient despite the cat, you kept this Patient because of the cat. You're scared there's something to it.","If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would. Cat version will have to do. Are you scared?"
"Cats' brains are always in alpha mode. The few scientific tests that have seemed to confirm psyParkc phenomena, that's where it takes place.",Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.
Don't you want to check their charts?,Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to Even subconsciously
He has a sEvere cat allergy.,That nEver happened.
Look at Debbie.,"Good news, Mister! Limpert, when you don't die tonight you will finally have done something good for the world as opposed to your life as a! fireMan. Foreman's airborne allergen theory makes the most sense. Do a methacholine challenge on Catgirl to check it out."
"I told you to get rid of ""death cat.""",Do you see a cat?
I see a litter box.,"This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy. Can't make it to the men's room on time."
You pee on the mice too?,"Well, now you see the mice actually prove that I don't have a cat."
Are these! are these the genetically modified lab mice from oncology?,Genetically modified for tastiness.
Get rid of the cat and get rid of your Patient.,My team's doing a methacholine challenge.
"Your team just completed a methacholine challenge, which came up negative.",Who told you about the test? Taub?
I'll nEver say. But yes.,"Her airways clamped down. I heard it. We kick her onto the street, it could happen again. I wish there was a lawsuit cat. It could warn you."
"I'm sorry, but if you won't escort her out, I'll have to get security to do it.",You're joining me for a good-bye smoke.
I don't smoke.,"Fine. If you don't want the sEventh graders to think you're cool. I went through your purse. Horoscopes. Good luck charms. You went to a good college, good nursing school. So you weren't always a superstitious idiot."
I'm not a super!,"How 'bout four years, that sound right? That's when you switched from a family insurance plan to the one you're on now."
I was married. I got divorced.,"Two years before that, you got Parkcken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid. Or I should say when you had a kid because no kid has come to visit you. Which all makes me think something bad happened."
"It was my stepson, Timothy.",What happened?
He was in school. He was having his morning snack. And he choked. And the teacher saw it and they did Everything that they were supposed to. He shouldn't have died.,You want to make it make sense.
What's wrong with that?,"It's meaningless, is what's wrong. What's wrong is that it doesn't do a thing to bring your kid back, or put you and your ex together again. Rash on your neck. PRobably not enough for Cuddy."
I can't breathe.,"Hey, doc. Breath sound soft to you, doc? Hooray! You're officially sick."
"Hey, doc. Breath sound soft to you, doc? Hooray! You're officially sick.","Churg-Strauss fits best. Here's the plan! Taub, change the litter box."
This is pathetic. You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?,"Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box."
"Now that you've delivered that important lesson, I'm gonna go test the Patient.","What, you think your bag's gonna die now?"
Now you're punishing me because you think I'm superstitious? What do you care?,"It's not so much about me caring per se. It's more about me wondering why you're such a credulous idiot. Thirteen, start the Patient on steroids for the Churg-Strauss. Unless we have something we need to argue about."
"It's brown. I didn't do anything, honest.",I'm just a girl who can't say no.
It is possible she's still faking.,"She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's ""Unchausen""."
What?,Nothing.
We've ruled out Every possible cause for brown urine. No blood in the urine. Liver and kidneys fine.,Brown could be fecal. A fistula!
How do we know the urine is still brown?,Had to be. Once you've gone brown!
"If we've ruled out Everything that can make the urine brown, what if it just looked brown? If the green dye nEver left her system, what plus green makes brown?",Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.
We scoped her when we checked for the fistula. There's no tumor.,"Oh, no."
I wasn't scared by the umbrella either.,"What? Not Everything's about you, Kutner."
I realize it's stupid. I just! I don't know Everything. I don't want to invite!,"Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed. But ""you're stupid"" works just as well."
Why is there a ladder here?,"Oops. Forgot that one. Scopes don't work as well as pillcams. Give her one. Find the tumor. Come with me, tiny Taub."
Sorry I was late again. I've got a long commute from the poor House.,"Knew it when I hired you. You'd Eventually miss the money, being the big shot like your new CEO friend, if that night club stamp on your hand is any indication."
"Don't worry, I'm not quitting.",I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.
Bad example. I did tell her.,"From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late Every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed."
"From guilt, not from courage. And bravely running to Cuddy behind my back. Arriving heroically late Every day. Cowards make lousy employees. Maybe you're a coward, maybe you're quitting. Either way, I'm screwed.","You will note how ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!""ï¿½ has snuggled up by Coma Guy over there. And more importantly, she did yesterday as well. And he's still breathing. We done?"
Thank you for showing me this. But maybe she's just confused in this new environment.,"In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return. His followers gave away all their possessions and showed up in a field. Guess who didn't show. So the preacher said that he miscalculated, and they went right back the next month but with more followers. Every time he was irrefutably proved wrong, it redoubled Everyone's belief."
You're trying to prove to her she's not dying?,That would be dumb as she might be dying.
This Woman lost her kid. Why are you attacking beliefs that give her a little bit of comfort?,I don't care if her superstitions make her feel better. I just want her to think more clearly.
Oh. Maybe that could make her as happy as you are. Where are we going?,"Experimenting. Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It's just not cute anymore!"
You already experimented on the coma guy. Haven't you proved your point?,Not to the Patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.
Why are you so obsessed with this? Can't you just call her an idiot and leave Everyone alone?,"Hey, look, kids, therapy cat."
"You're a liar. Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.",Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.
"No, okay. Uh, kids, playtime's over. You know what, this is a good thing. Because either you're starting to doubt yourself, which is healthy, or ï¿½",I don't beliEve in the legend of goodbye kitty.
"Or, you're starting to give a crap what other people think. Which is just another way of saying you give a crap about other people.","I'd love to hear more of your theory, but I don't give a crap. Also, the pillcam's back."
"I'd love to hear more of your theory, but I don't give a crap. Also, the pillcam's back.",Polypoid. Raised edges.
How Many times are we gonna watch this? There's no tumor.,"Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die."
Maybe it has something to do with that little red dot dancing around down there.,"Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die."
Maybe we're not wasting time. We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.,Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.
"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here. Here, kitty.",What?
It's not cancer. We found spider veins on her back. They weren't there when she came in.,"Spider veins means Cushing's. Could cause an abdominal disturbance, brown urine!"
But the bronchospasm?,Cushing's myopathy. It's uncommon but! Wait a second. You didn't wake me up to tell me a symptom that's not killing her. What else is going on?
I think she's dying.,I just told you it's Cushing's. We treat!
I don't mean because of the spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.,If that's my high school gym teacher!
"It's your coma Patient. He was stable for a year and a half, and he just died. The cat was right, House.","Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss."
"Say ""puss"" one more time. It's the sixth ""puss"" that really does it.","You're right. Sulking will solve Everything. That cat sat on my lap, and that cat knows something."
Yesterday it was all a coincidence.,Yesterday it was until I unintentionally proved it wasn't.
Cat's nose is powerful. It could smell liver or kidney failure.,"Exactly, except if you'd glanced at the nursing home files I had faxed over this morning, you'd know that most of the Patients' livers and kidneys were fine; what else?"
MRI's aren't telling us if the Cushing's in her adrenals or her brain.,So check her ACTH.
ACTH is 11.7. It's too close to tell. We can't treat the wrong organ 'cause that won't solve anything. She could have a cortisol storm. Could kill her.,"Well, maybe as the senior fellow you could have made sure that my doors were closed, so that I could be concentrating on the cat instead of looking for the cat."
"Sounds like he said ""do you like cranberry juice?"" Crap.",Cheaper than fake blood. And more cran-tastic. Don't Ever leave my door open like that again.
You're playing pranks and this Woman could be dying.,"So have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain. If he finds something, it's there. If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals."
What exactly are you hoping to find inside your dead coma guy?,Catnip. Chew toy. I don't know. That's why I'm looking!
"Your Patient had cardiac arrest during the venous sampling. We got her back, but her heart's still tenuous.",That tell us anything?
"She's weak, possibly dying.",So nothing. What about the ACTH?
Slightly elevated.,That confirms the Cushing's is in the brain! go.
Are you sure that it's Cushing's? You'd expect central body obesity. She's in good shape.,"If it had a normal presentation, there wouldn't be a cat involved."
So it's the brain. That means the next question is whether to remove the pituitary right now!,That's not a question for me. That's a question for the Patient. You'll present both sides and let her decide.
I've got to stop telling you my theories. You always just try to prove me wrong.,You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass getting bigger at the full moon? I confirmed that one. Photo's on my blog.
"Normally, you'd be up in the Patient room hectoring her on what to do. Instead you're up to your elbows in some irrelevant dead guy who may or may not be connected to a magic cat because you want to prove to me that you don't care.",Case is over. I'm exploring a scientific mystery.
I'll schedule an operating room.,Early.
I'm not staying long. I'm quitting.,You got a new job?
No.,"Well then, you're not quitting. See you back here tomorrow."
You're not accepting my resignation?,"Easier this way. It avoids the whole thing where you panic, run back and grovel, and I punish you and then take you back."
Bye.,Bring donuts. Everyone loves those bear claws.
Bring donuts. Everyone loves those bear claws.,"Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss. Puss?"
No.,"I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths. It was just trying to keep warm."
"Yes, dead people are renowned for their warm glow.","They are if they're fEverish, like three of the Patients were. Or if they're wasting away, like the other eight."
Wasting doesn't!,"Yeah, it does. If it means someone sticks a heating blanket on you."
"Congrats. Because of your crazy obsession with this cat, you've solved a completely trivial mystery.","Completely trivial. My God. It's clearly only partially trivial. Debbie climbed on Morgan too, which means she was overheated. So what causes flushing and mimics Every Cushing's symptom except central body obesity?"
Cancer. A corticotropin-producing carcinoid tumor of the intestine. But your pillcam didn't find anything.,Means it must be somewhere the pillcam couldn't go.
"The appendix. Congratulations, you pRobably saved her life. You definitely saved her needless surgery.","Yes, I did. What's the O.R. extension number? Just curious."
Thank you.,I wouldn't come here for thanks. That would be ungracious. It's more about gloating. You were about to cut out a piece of your brain just to Chase some crazy superstition.
But I didn't.,"You ""didn't"" didn't do anything. I stopped it."
And what made you do that?,Science. Logic. Reason. Pick any three.
A cat chooses that exact moment to sit on your computer. Maybe that's science and logic and reason or maybe it's something else.,You're an idiot.
I looked up the preacher from New York State. His followers nEver faded out. They became the SEventh Day Adventists. A major religion. That Man changed the course of history.,Because his followers were as deluded as he was.
Maybe he just gave them something to live for.,Feel better.
Feel better.,Kutner! Cat pee on my chair?
Blood on my face?,Fake blood! You pay for the dry-cleaning.
"Yeah, a cat!",See you tomorrow.
"Who. My heart? Oh, God! They don't know I'm in here.","Hey, genius. I think it violates certain ethical laws to rip the organs out of a guy who's still alive. Possibly certain law laws too."
"Could you, um, get back in your bed, please, Mr. House?",It's actually Doctor House.
This guy's a doctor?,There's also Navy Seal House. But you're going to have to save up for that one.
"Really? Well, that's interesting, but! you're here because you crashed your motorcycle, not because I need a consult. So, get back in bed.","Scraped my elbow. I just need a truckload of Vicodin. Whereas, this guy!"
So drop it.,See that?
"No EKG response to painful stimuli, hot or cold. What you're seeing is random, barely discernable.",I discerned it.
"No, no, no, it's not! It's me.",Then why is his eye following you?
"No, no, I'm not dead. I need help. I'm here!",I also know about locked-in syndrome! That things are either involuntary! or voluntary. Blink if you can hear me.
I hear you.,"Oh, this is going to be fun."
I hope so.,The square root of nine? He got that faster than you. Brain is fully functional.
"No, I can't be stuck like this.",Unless! the crash didn't cause the brain damage. Maybe the brain damage caused the crash.
Yeah. I couldn't stop. Why couldn't I stop?,Look at his palms. No scrapes. He didn't Even try to protect himself. Suggests slowed reflexes! or no reflexes.
"Yeah, and you're the guy who wants to cut out my organs, and he's the guy who doesn't.","Get me the scans. Stroke, cancer, Even a simple infection. Anything that insults the central pons could do this."
I don't know how God is going to get us through this. But he will.,Stop it. I'm blushing.
What are you doing?,Just looking for some reading material for the crapper. These CTs ï¿½
You okay?,NEver better.
Here's your burger.,"If you can't bring Mohammed to Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed. That's my diagnostics posse. Hot, dark and darker."
Who cares?,Buying a Gibson '57 Goldtop. It's the guitar Duane AllMan used to play.
"Next to the trauma, the most likely causes of a sudden onset of locked-in syndrome are basilar artery stroke and brain hemorrhage.",CT was clean.
Certain circulatory diseases.,"Guy's an active bike rider, his heart's fine."
It was a melted PowerBar.,"She's the smart one. I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota. If we find it, treat it, you could be fine."
"I nEver thought I'd be praying for a brain tumor, but please, dear God.","If you're praying in there, stop it right now."
We'll get his doctor to order an MRI.,"His doctor's busy teaParkng him how to blink out ""kill me"" in Morse code. Luckily, I found some forms under the mattress."
I hope they! work! wow. You're in my relaxing scenario?,I guess you like me.
Either that or you got sent here.,What? By God?
I'm not sure if I beliEve in God.,You spend an awful lot of time in church for someone who doesn't.
I don't not beliEve either.,It's either one or the other.
"I go to church mainly to keep my wife happy, but! I don't know, I've nEver actually thought that God could reach out and affect my life. But getting a brilliant doctor in the bed next to me?",God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.
I think Molly was right. I think you were sent here to make me get better.,I think so.
What time is it?,Hope you don't mind. My new roommate snores. And my new room doesn't have you. Your MRI showed a lesion in the central pons.
What is that? What does that mean?,See it there?
No.,"Mm, that's what they said. But it's there. Which means no way head trauma did this. It's cancer, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome. Unfortunately, your current doctor thinks its diffuse nature means an infection. Now the bad news is, the antivirals he's got you on might kill you."
I'm not gonna die.,"But the good news is if they just almost kill you, then Dr. Idiot will realize that his name is not a coincidence and he'll let me do whatEver I want."
Thank you.,"See, the irony here is! you're kind of fascinating. So Many questions. But if you could answer any of them, then you wouldn't be fascinating."
"I get it. You're a little nuts, aren't you?","Your wife is the one getting you through this. Your wife and me. Although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding. I think."
"If he had a wife, he'd know why it matters.",You're a good guy. Easy to talk to.
"Wait, something's happening. What's happening to me?",Need some help in here! Your Patient is seizing.
Why would he have a seizure?,Because he has cancer!
Why are you still arguing with this guy? You thought I was dead.,Welcome back. And nicely played. You almost died. Exactly as we planned.
You knew this was going to happen?,"It usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer. Right, doctor? My turn?"
Yes!,"A small tumor in his brain stem, causing paraneoplastic syndrome. He needs plasmapheresis."
Please shut up.,I don't. Which means I can treat him.
Absolutely.,Would you send up a couple of bellboys?
I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay?,Fresh infusion of macho. You like?
"What were you doing up there, anyway?","Antiquing. I found you a late Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up."
Sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.,PRobably because there was no message. I've decided to accept your resignation.
"Uh, I thought we were past this. I decided to stay.","No, you didn't. You had it decided for you. So now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else. Which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas. Unless I'm wrong. Save the cheerleader. Save your world. I got it from here."
"Hey, just curious! what're you driving up to Middletown for?",What do you care?
Because I'm your friend.,I was buying a guitar.
"Yeah, I heard that. It used to belong to a guitarist who died in a motorcycle accident. It just reeks of you screwing with people. Your crash was ten miles from the Orange County Progressive Pain Clinic.","You live ten miles from Mary's Dress Shop. And yet, that's not Even on my list of reasons that I think you're secretly a transvestite."
He's on drugs?,I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife!
What?,!who lives in Thompson Ridge. I let her know about the extra money you're making on the lecture circuit. So she'll be sure to adjust your alimony.
You wouldn't do that.,Yeah. I wouldn't do that.
Do you drink?,He's a roofer. Alcohol hardly proves your theory.
!MPPP.,"Either we play 20,000 questions with Every street drug, or instead of talking to him, we talk to the lesion."
We're going to biopsy the brain stem?,"For the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea. It's sort of where I was heading."
How come I'm not better? God's not supposed to work in trial and error.,"God's mistakes are well-documented. If he'd done Everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods."
Those were because of huMan mistakes.,You think your doctor has an apartment on Mount Olympus?
"God put me with you for a reason. I'm gonna be all right still, right?",I don't know.
Why aren't his eyes moving?,"Two options: My neurologist screwed up, or else something the hospital Lawyer's going to have to come up with when you sue us."
"But he's still in there, right? I mean, he just can't communiCate?","It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone."
"It's possible. Also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.",He had one way to communiCate and now that's gone. Well played.
"He runs a business, meets a lot of people he could've picked up rotavirus.",Did he report having bloody diarrhea?
"The wife's not sure, says he doesn't complain.",Did you ask him?
"We've prioritized. He can only blink, a real history would've taken weeks.","If he had Epstein-Barr, he'd have belly pains. If he had picornavirus, he'd have headaches. Five other yes/no questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give. And what treatment would kill him. Unless he's already dead."
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife. She was at a sweat lodge in New Mexico last week. What were you really doing in New York?,You know how you hate it when I meddle in your lies? I mean your life.
Why are you being so evasive? Unless you have something to evade.,"Interesting. This has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain. I was heading to the Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill."
One of your hookers arrange a conjugal visit?,It's where Foreman's brother is being held.
"I am scared. Molly, I love you so much.",Have you had any bloody diarrhea in the last two weeks?
Rotavirus out.,Any recent joint pain?
He was in St. Louis.,Good. Could be Missouri malaria. Let's start treatment.
He was! he was there. The maParkne must not be working.,"Hmmm. Either that or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes. For example, I just lied to him about Missouri malaria."
I should've told you. Why didn't I just tell you? Down.,"When you weren't in St. Louis for two days, I assume you were getting some strange for two days."
So does she. You have to tell her I wasn't.,Amazing. A Man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.
I'm not lying.,"If you were getting some really strange strange, you could've contracted neurosyphilis. Infection went to your brain, froze you right up. Good news is it's treatable. You'll be up and moving in time to sign the divorce papers."
I'm liking this one more and more. Don't fire him.,Were you out of the state?
I nEver left.,Were you within 20 miles of your House?
Yes.,Were you within five miles?
Yes.,Within two miles?
Yes.,Did you stay at a hotel?
No.,You had to sleep somewhere. Your car?
No.,A friend's House?
Yes. Yes.,"That narrows it down, depending on how popular you are. Tell the wife to stop crying, get in here. He says that when he was supposed to be in St. Louis, he was staying at a friend's House."
Yes.,Let's assume that you beliEve him for the moment. Name your friends within two miles.
No.,Guess someone who doesn't have a wife.
Yes.,Got an address?
I want to keep my job.,Great. All you gotta do is come up with a good idea.
"How about we hook the guy's brain to a computer, so he can communiCate?",That's a great idea. For the guy who invented the computer that can read minds. Your idea was to use his idea.
"You didn't come up with it. No one else came up with it. If I didn't re-establish communication, we nEver would have found ï¿½",What's interesting is why you're here now. Not when I gave you the ultimatum. Was it something the Patient said?
I realized that what we do here! terrifies me. And! overcoming that is the only way I can matter.,Kutner found the battery factory. Kutner came up with the cadmium. Maybe you don't matter.
"When's the last time you changed that dressing? Judging by the smell of it, I'd say nEver.","He's locked-in, his kidneys blew a fuse, and now his eye is oozing pus."
"I assume you went over all of that with your team. I also assume they didn't have any brilliant ideas, or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself. This is going to hurt.",Ow! The way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella ï¿½
Road Debris has come to the surface. I'm going to have to scrub it out.,But the initial acyclovir would've treated that. Which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease. Like Behcet's.
"Here! this is going to hurt Even more. Take two now, two later.","Oops. Ho! Of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown."
Do an LP.,"You've been in the ER too long. When the Patient had head trauma, white blood cells only indiCate that he had head trauma."
"Or you could use the LP for something useful. If you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, Behcet's.",Why did I fire you again?
"You weren't visiting Foreman's brother, either.","Busy. Kutner's doing an LP, so I have to focus."
"I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records. You've nEver had any contact with anyone at Fishkill. So, I ask again! What were you doing up in Middletown?",You know what's more interesting than what I was doing? The reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.
"Stop deflecting, House.","Says the deflector. The reason I was up there is the reason you're scared I was up there. I was checking out your dirty, little secret. How long have you been sleeping with her?"
How! how did you know?,Your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing. And the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.
We've only been out a few times.,She's a caregiver. Like all of your other failed exes. And someone who takes care of your brother. Who was the last person who took care of your brother?
You think this is Oedipal?,"Actually, I was thinking masturbatory, but I guess your mom took care of him first. So, the safe course is to gouge your eyes out."
There is no God. You don't know what's wrong with me.,It doesn't seem that way.
So am I dead?,Not yet. But you're about to be.
"No. No. Let me go. He can't fix me. I've been here for three days, Everything hurts.","The arrest means the demyelination hit the area in his brainstem that controls heart rhythm. We need answers fast, 'cause this is going to happen again."
"It's okay, just! just!",Not without the results of the LP.
"So we put in a temporary pacer, it's not gonna ï¿½","Shut up, shut up. He's trying to talk. Is something bothering you?"
"Maybe he's not saying ""no,"" maybe he's saying ""down."" Are you saying that the pain is lower? How low, your leg? Your foot?","Left foot? Check his! let me see now! yeah, his right foot."
"No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.",Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation? Is it itParkng?
Then there should be no pain. Is it a tingling sensation? Is it itParkng?,Itchy foot means liver failure.
The liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.,"I didn't say ""failing,"" I said ""failure."" Just like you. Liver's like a cruise ship taking on water. As it starts to sink, it sends out an S.O.S. Only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes. The more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is. And once the ship has sunk, there's no more S.O.S. You think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea."
"So dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.",Now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.
"Liver, plus eye, plus kidney! most likely sclerosing cholangitis.","Oh, God, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending. Do a biopsy to confirm."
I did it.,Rat pee. Very nice idea. Who came up with it?
I did.,Good. You okay with him claiming the credit?
It was his idea. He saw the rash ï¿½,"If he did, he'd have hung a ""mission accomplished"" banner in my outer office."
Don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him ï¿½,The fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie. That's all I needed to know. Rat pee. That's a very nice idea.
House. You left this in my office.,"No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket ï¿½"
"Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it. Because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it. You would've thrown her right in my face.",You underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.
And then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me. So I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking. You're seeing a psyParkatrist.,You had no right to invade my privacy.
Is! is that!?,Yeah. It's irony.
Hey. God sent you.,"Suddenly, you're not so fascinating."
You're spying on your team.,"Prioritize, Wilson. Is that what you really want to torture me about right now?"
I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing. Not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.,Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my Parkldhood wasn't perfect.
So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to beliEve that maybe something else has changed. Maybe you think you can change. Credit Cuddy with that.,"Not much credit to take, because I'm not going back."
"Oh, House, please! I assume you went because you're tired of screwing up Every chance you get at happiness.",Delete contact.
Do not let the fact that I found out about it ï¿½,Don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work.
"54-year-old Woman with acute respiratory failure. No anaphylaxis, lung issues or tracheal lesions. Tox screen was clean for coke and amphetamines.","I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that cause the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis. Why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?"
No apnea because no sleeping pRoblems when she's sleeping. She spent the last six months caring for her husband who's dying of heart failure.,"Reason 31 ï¿½ whatEver whacked the husband's heart is also whacking her airway and! Oh, good. I thought maybe Kutner was home nursing the rib you broke when you elbowed your way in for credit on the last Patient."
I contributed. And the Patient's illness wasn't caused by her husband unless lung cancer's contagious.,Interesting. Not about the Patient. That was kinda dull. I thought maybe you were lying to cover for Kutner which sounds noble. Except you're doing it out of guilt instead of love.
Could have picked up melioidosis from one of the islands.,Would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.
"No tumors, no drugs, no bacteria. Leaves viral ï¿½ varicella zoster.",Start her on IV fluids and acyclovir.
Can't. She's deManding to be released so she can get home to her husband.,"How sweet. They can die together instead of separately, 40 years apart."
The mind can heal the body. Seeing his wife in distress might have actually slowed down his death.,Or he could have just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles market. Send her home.
The pageant starts in an hour. You have to do something. There's something wrong inside her head. It's like she has no idea what's going on around her.,"I thought she was just flirting with me. I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you! $3.75. I'm not just gonna give you my coffee. Think of it as Costa Rican sober juice."
She's drunk?,That little minty scent hiding beneath the rose petal perfume and the cherry blossom moisturizer and the morning dew hair spray. You sneak into mommy's bathroom and gulp some of her mouthwash?
Gotta be perfect.,You spit it out?
She can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.,"Win some, lose some. And strictly speaking, since he's not my Patient, win some. Look at the time. It's half past ""Taub was lying about Kutner.""ï¿½"
"He pRobably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll ï¿½","Find out what or who he's doing. Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under ""reason for termination.""ï¿½"
He's cold. Eric!,He didn't say anything? To any of you? Family pRoblems? Bad relationship? Financial pressures?
His parents were shot right in front of him.,Parents are ancient history.
Not to someone who actually cares.,He didn't slit his wrists and! peacefully drift away. He shot himself. He didn't leave a note. That means panic. Which could have been preempted if the idiots who worked alongside him for 80 hours a week had seen this coming.
You're blaming us?,Just trying to figure it out.
This isn't our fault! Something like 25% of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.,No. 25% of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.
"We still have a Patient. Actually, two. One worsening, one who should be worsening.",You can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.
It's possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.,"Well, call the tabloids. Tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function."
Maybe we should pass this file over to another doctor.,And the next one too? The one after that? How Many files till it's okay that Kutner's dead? Cardiac enzymes means she didn't have a heart attack. No vision pRoblems means no mitochondrial disease.
"I'm sorry. I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take. But just know it's available.",Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin.
If you'd rather not deal with this case!,I'm fine. Despite what Wilson will say.
He hasn't come to you?,Pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings. I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.
You didn't Even have an inkling?,I know his fantasy football team cratered. Figured he'd gotten over it.
Well! Sorry for your loss.,Thanks. But it's not my loss.
Then I'm sorry you don't think it is.,Patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.
Taub went to run the treatment. We'd like to go see Kutner's parents.,I'll join you.
Wish we did. We all ï¿½,"It was his name. He was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in, being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours."
We encouraged him to hold onto his heritage.,It's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when Everyone sees you as Kutner.
It was his idea to take our name.,Then you should have said no.
House.,"All his Anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn't. You were being emotional, not rational. You didn't understand him."
"We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.","You wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain. When he looked happy, you assumed the pain had gone. It just got buried deeper, leaving him tormented about who he was until finally he put a bullet ï¿½"
House! Go back to the hospital.,I'm sorry about your son.
"Indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis. I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal. Means he's actually improving. Body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons ï¿½ stress, fear! Why not love? But maybe he's going into some sort of remission/",You haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.
"If you had, I'm sure you would have mentioned it.",Or you're afraid there is something relevant. Which would mean you could have saved him.
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help. Sometimes you just don't want help.,Good thing you got some. Or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.
She doesn't have Wegener's. Kidney function's normal. It's not byssinosis. It's not mitral valve stenosis. Nothing fits.,"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis."
"If it doesn't fit any diagnosis, it just leaves one diagnosis.",I'm Dr. House. You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His heart is too weak. Yours is too strong. Good news is it's fixable. We induce a massive heart attack and kill off the extra muscle.
You wanna give me a heart attack?,It's only dangerous if your heart is normal size. But since all the ï¿½
Are you serious?,"No. This is actually very annoying and I'm getting really bored of lying to Patients to scare them into telling me the truth. She's faking. And yes, if she keeps faking I'm going to Eventually do something that will kill her."
How could she be! The windpipe thing?,"That was real. Treatment made her better. But good for her was bad for you which was bad for her. So she made herself bad. It's all so simple. She figured the sicker she was, the longer you'd hang on."
We haven't been this close for years. I wanted to hang on to that. Ow!,"Oh, please. People hate reruns."
It's my leg. I swear this is real!,"What, you pinky swear or you just plain swear? Because ï¿½"
How can she fake that?,She can't.
She can't.,"So, what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?"
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner. They caused Kutner's death. Why not Charlotte's?,"Mourning period's over. Foreman's sense of irony is back. I was wrong about the ethnic reason. Step one ï¿½ change your name back. Step two ï¿½ if step one fails ï¿½ move to Bangalore. Step fourteen, if step Thirteen doesn't work, kill yourself."
So what now? You gonna insult your way through his Rolodex till you find someone with an answer?,I've been polite to the friends I've called. All of whom were useless.
They weren't useless. They just didn't know anything more than we did.,"Tomato, tomah-to."
"MS. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction. I'm talking about Charlotte, the one who's still alive.","You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving."
"You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.",Did you let me hire a pervert?
Did you let me hire a pervert?,Kutner's police background check from when he started. He was charged with indecent exposure.
"Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth football game. Precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do. It's okay. You should be upset. He thought like you, pushed boundaries like you ï¿½","If he thought like me, he would know that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it."
"For the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.",It's only violating it if you find something. Good to see you.
What are we looking for?,He was hiding. Why?
Shame? Fear? Are you okay? It's okay not to be okay.,"""Colonial Warrior Blaster. Number One One.""ï¿½ He spent months tracking this down. He had passions."
He was obviously in pain. Does it really matter why?,"He hung the bad with the good. His loss beside a reminder of what he'd gained. Means he was open about the pain. Should mean that if it got worse, he had no reason to hide it."
"Here's how we're going to handle this, House. We're going to leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an OR. And pass out in our own sick. Sound like a plan?",What am I missing? You've got that look. You figured this out.
You're not here because you care about Kutner. You're here because it's a mystery. You're here for the puzzle.,What if I didn't miss anything 'cause there's nothing to miss? He didn't kill himself. He was murdered.
Autoimmne hepatitis? Did you page Foreman?,Took up Cuddy's offer of time off. Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.
"Could be Amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue ï¿½",Her muscles wouldn't have atrophied. You run the echo on the husband?
Heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.,"I prefer the less subtle answer: You were right, House. So! Less time proving why hubby isn't dead, more time proving why Kutner is. Motives for murder."
House! it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.,"They investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw. Talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy. And draft Foreman. He can make calls through his tears."
No.,"Is that ""No, I'm not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn't coming in?""ï¿½ 'Cause it's really not fair to have that much subtext in one syllable."
We all want to know why Kutner did it but we're not gonna waste time chasing ghosts.,You're not remotely curious?
Only why a Man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.,She could have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Run her AAT proteins.
IT's been trying to close out Kutner's email account. Apparently someone's still logged onto it.,It wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner. He did what they tell you not to do.
He wasn't murdered.,But his parents were. And the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.
He's coming up for parole. He's not out on parole.,Kutner testified at Every one of his hearings. The guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.
He was killed by his own gun.,"Which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense."
In the temple. Cops found residue.,Right. The murderer would nEver try to make it look like suicide. That would be unethical. You haven't asked about my Patient.
You're waiting on an AAT protein results.,Means you checked up to see that I'm still on it. You wanna transfer the case but you won't because you think it's the only thing that's holding me together. Relax. Either I'm right or I'm wrong. We'll know soon enough.
She's stable. But whatEver was left of her liver is definitely shot now. And there's no change in Eddie.,"So, thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver."
It was selfless. She loves him.,How does that disagree with what I just said?
"No diagnosis, no liver. No liver, no living.",What do you know. It is myelofibrosis. Says so right here. Who wants to tell Cuddy?
How Many times have you lied to the transplant committee?,Just twice.
How Many times has it worked?,I don't quite see how that's relevant. Cheese it. It's the coppers.
We're not just going to leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.,"Technically, he's not our Patient. So I'm really only leaving her to die."
We've already explored the usual options. Shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?,Absolutely. Don't worry. This is why God gave me two ears.
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.,"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, ""Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting ï¿½""ï¿½"
"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, ""Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting ï¿½""ï¿½",Need an incurable roMantic to talk to an incurable roMantic.
Kutner wasn't murdered.,You deduced that by removing your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?
Suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.,"Needs a liver. Has a liver. He can make a partial donation. The faster he agrees, the faster she gets to not die."
Partial won't be enough. She needs a whole liver and he'd nEver survive the procedure.,"Nice symmetry, huh?"
He dies on the table and you give her his whole liver.,"If he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language."
You can't do the transplant.,Only if he said no. But your urgent hovering means he said yes.
His fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.,Or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.
Obese Man with lung cancer ï¿½ Two easy explanations for his heart failure. Nodules can mean something else. Something curable.,Go back to the ER. My thanks to you and your cold feet.
"What's going on? I'm giving you a shot at a cool result. Better yet, a chance to prove other doctors idiotic.",Except you're wrong.
You figure that out by taking off your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?,The guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.
Kutner hid from Everyone. You didn't get a chance to save him. No one did. Run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.,"Bad news. Love can't save you. On the other hand, mold can. Your heart failure was caused by a fungal infection called cardiac blastomycosis. It started as nodules in your lungs which Every doc, except one, mistook for cancer. It's very rare, very curable. I'm starting you on itraconazole."
But how come I was getting better without the medicine?,Your emotional state bumped your Catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.
My emotional state?,"Three months of treatment, you'll be back to your buff, Parkseled self."
I don't want the treatment. Do the transplant.,But you'd be trading the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.
I was ready to die anyway.,Now you get to be nicer to your next wife.
You're basically asking us to commit murder.,I was yesterday too.
There's a difference when he has 20 years to live instead of two days.,Not really. Not legally.
"That's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?",The idiot is gonna do this with or without us. This way we can protect the organ.
We should be protecting him.,"So we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?"
She spiked a fEver. LP shows her white cells through the roof. She's infected Everywhere.,I should fire you.
Infection means we have a new clue.,And a full two or three hours to figure it out.
Sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.,She would have lung issues.
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.,No skin or GI pRoblems. What is she hiding?
You don't know that ï¿½,Either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.
"Possible exposure, people, places.",Both.
Both.,Bad lie. Did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio? The disease bearing sand flies are completely different.
She's nEver been to Rio.,Who'd you go with?
Why are you doing this?,"I don't actually need to know who it was. I just need to know that you went so we can know that you have visceral leishManiasis. But since Lancelot there was ready to die for you, he might want the answer to both."
Last year! It was nobody you know. Rio was supposed to be ours. I got tired of waiting. I'm so sorry.,"Start her on antimony and have Cuddy find her a liver. They were ready to die. But for guilt, not love."
I was wrong about you.,"No, you weren't."
You're in pain.,And you're roManticizing. Again.
You worked with him Every day for two years and you nEver saw this coming.,No one saw it coming.
"But you see Everything coming. This has nEver been about what you missed. This is about why you missed it. You're terrified that you're losing your gift, losing! who you are. And I'm terrified of what you'd do then.","Unless you feel there's more to do here to cure me, don't you have a funeral to go to?"
He's seen three different specialists.,Interesting. Almost as interesting as you trying to step into Kutner's shoes just days after he stepped out of them.
"If he was trying to fake an illness, why would he consent to be seen by the best diagnostician in the country?","Now who's trying to get her hybrid waxed? We need to do a vestibular caloric test. See if the balance pRoblem starts above or below the neck. And when I say ""we,""ï¿½ I mean ""you.""ï¿½ You're the one with the favor to repay, not them."
That's normal. Sometimes this test causes vertigo and nausea.,Cameron just brought me a case.
"Cameron is happy in the ER. There's no way she wants her nose back on your grindstone. Egg white omelet, no bacon, whole wheat toast.",I say it's not my grindstone she's after. And not her nose she wants on it. She and Chase are practically living together. What did you just order?
An omelet.,Since when do you pass on the swine? And wheat toast? Might as well eat a sheet of sandpaper.
Yes. But I don't like eating the same thing two days in a row.,Your bro's nurse not lovin' the love handles?
"I'm just not in the mood for bacon. And you're obviously trying to avoid talking about Kutner. Which is odd, because you spent a whole week obsessing about why ï¿½",He's no longer on my team. I'm sorry he's no longer on my team. Nothing else to talk about.
You're wearing the watch he gave you for Secret Santa.,"Five functions, including a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to ask me if I'm okay."
You gonna order?,Not hungry.
And you know this because ï¿½,"She changed her shoes. If he was faking, he'd have vomited on the other side of the bed."
Could also be our only warning before a massive stroke.,"Do a Holter and a carotid Doppler. See if his heart skips for more than the spotted owl. Although I didn't say ""we.""ï¿½ If I had! {Cameron leaves instead.]"
No sight of heart or arterial pRoblems but he's been hiccupping on and off for over a week.,"Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back to your shift at the ER. Except, as far as the ER is concerned, you're on vacation, right?"
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned about the Patient.,"Explains why you ditched Chase and came to differentials, not why you ran the tests."
You told me to.,"Well, I'm not your boss, as you usually take great pleasure in pointing out. Hey, you don't still have the hots for me, do you?"
I care about the Patient and I care about the people who work on your team. They've been through a lot lately. I just thought I ï¿½,Was Florence Nightingale. Yeah. You're gonna nurse us back to spiritual and mental oneness. That would make sense if we were having this conversation a week ago.
"Think what you want ï¿½ that I'm here to get a job, that I'm here to wrap you in swaddling clothes.","The pRoblem is, I think neither. Because neither makes sense. The only thing that does! doesn't."
Pathological hiccups plus inability to balance. Go.,What she said.
Brain would connect the two.,"It could, if Cameron hadn't already CT'd his head. Empty as her boyfriend's calendar."
Nothing.,Not sure yet.
It's possible it's not connected to a protest. MS wouldn't show on the CT and his name's Swenson. Scandinavians have an increased susceptibility to MS.,Better theory than he's faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.
I guess we'll just continue to twiddle our thumbs.,"God, I hope that's a euphemism."
How am I supposed to do a lumbar puncture on a Patient with intractable hiccups?,I'm trying to figure out what that could be a euphemism for. You'll find a way.
Dr. House?,"Sorry, I'm just the Zone delivery guy."
"I'm, uh, Doug Swenson's wife.",His history said the environmental kamikaze was single.
"He, um, he pRobably didn't want me to worry. He told me he was in jail with some of the other protesters.",Yeah. No worries there.
He's in jail a lot. Not so often in the hospital. I searched his e-mail and I found the referral to you yesterday.,You must really love your husband and travel by rickshaw. It only took you 18 hours to get here. Who eats kale? It's so bland it doesn't Even taste like kale.
"Uh, I had to find somebody to take care of our four-year-old son. Doug's all right, isn't he?",I have no idea. I know he's an idiot. And now I've learned that he's a liar. So we're making a ï¿½ Who told you I was in here?
The doctor in the office next to yours said that you might be here.,I got it figured out.
That mean we don't need to do the LP.,I was talking to her. You're not Even supposed to be here.
You want us to stop or not?,"What? Oh, I don't care what you do with him. You're not doing a favor for a doctor in Philly. You're doing a favor for an oncologist in North Jersey."
I'm spying on you for Wilson?,"Spying, preemptive grief counseling."
Wilson sees you ten times more than I do. He's a better liar and he wouldn't have to cancel a vacation to do it.,Good points. Also doesn't explain the diet.
What does any of this have to do with my husband?,Nothing. Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag. Or did you keep your maiden name?
He's married?,Yep. Got a kid too. Double threat. Eco-freak and deadbeat dad.
It's torticollis. Reaction to the chlorpromazine.,It's not just a spasm. It's swollen. Crunchy.
"Most likely, it was there all along. We just didn't notice it till the other symptoms made it worse.","So, what causes loss of balance, pathological hiccups, and a hole in his Gloria Steinem?"
He was protesting a lumber mill last fall. Sarcoid's been linked to pine forests.,No. His A.C.E. lEvels were normal.
"Progressive systemic sclerosis. Guy practically lives in industrial waste sites. If a solvent got absorbed through his lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm!",Start him on IV methyl-prednisolone for systemic sclerosis. Do a full work-up to confirm.
By myself?,Without yourself. Grab a bat. Grab some pine. Time to bring in the first string.
Why?,You obviously want to be here. I can't figure out why. I wanna see where you go when you can't be here.
"Come on in, House. Because who else is it going to be at 10:30 at night? And, no thanks, I already ate.",Didn't ask you to dinner.
"But you were going to. And, when I explained that I'd eaten hours ago, you were going to move on to your real entrï¿½e, rifling through my kitchen.",Hmmm. Inviting me to search your kitchen. Means that you know that I'd find nothing. Or that you know I'd find something so you're hoping that I'm going to assume the former and I won't bother to look.
"Or it means it's late, I'm tired, I know you're here to advance some paranoid theory based on a single egg white omelet, and I'd like to get it over with so we can both go to sleep.",Your single omelet theory conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today. Vegetable and grain gag-athon.
The Warren Commission found no evidence of a second lunch. Possibly because it was stolen from the doctor's lounge.,You're not getting any fatter. Your medical records were clean.
You checked my ï¿½ ?,"You're alone tonight, so it's Kutner."
How could Kutner have any conceivable ï¿½,"Your Patients live, your Patients die. You float above it all like a medical colossus. But a fellow doctor dies!"
"That's brilliant. Kutner was a wake-up call that if I didn't eat healthier, I might kill myself.",Mortality is mortality.
And! Ice cream is ice cream. Full fat content. Quadruple fat content.,Stuff you haven't eaten just proves you haven't eaten it.
What are you doing to him?,I assume they were checking for vascular pulsations. Either it's negative or he's a big wuss.
It's not a tumor or an aneurism.,Metabolic bone disease?
"But the bone covering might not be! If it's osteomyelitis, an infection eating away at his periosteum ï¿½",That explains the pain. Odds are it's a subclinical infection that we made worse with the steroids we gave him. Start him on IV antibiotics. X-ray his legs to confirm osteomyelitis.
Cameron's already done a full set of lower-body x-rays.,The infection obviously flared. Do 'em again.
"Brittle bones wouldn't cause hiccups. Plus, we'd have seen abnormal coloring in the sclerae.",Which leaves cancer.
Since when does bone cancer cause hiccups?,Which means it's not bone cancer.
"House is right. It'd be hard to find a guy outside Chernobyl who'd been exposed to more carcinogens. Pesticide plants, nuclear waste sites.",Tell Chase to repair the break. You two prep him for chemo.
You want to blast him with chemo for a cancer we don't Even know he has?,Nope. I wanna blast him for with chemo for a cancer that explains the symptoms.
Huh.,"Still enjoying your day off, I see."
Why are you prepping him for chemo?,The more interesting question is why do you care?
You're not Even sure that it's ï¿½,"What I mean is, why do you care from here? You can monitor the Patient from home. What's the difference between here and home?"
You're not at my home. This has nothing to do with ï¿½,"Any other differences? Hmm! there's less medical equipment, more training bras, and more Vegemite sandwiches. Actually, technically, right now, Chase is here. But that's because I called him, and you didn't know that. And it's irrelevant to my point. Which is! You and Chase are over."
You are wrong.,You decided that his single drawer of clothes is one drawer too Many. But you don't have the guts to tell him. So! You're emotionally walking away instead of actually walking away. Which is stupid 'cause only one of those is good for your heart.
He's gonna ask me to marry him. I was looking for some thick socks. Found the ring.,And you want to say no. So I circle right back to his single drawer of clothes ï¿½
"I don't want to say anything. I don't want him to ask. Not now. Kutner! We're all a little freaked out. We go home, we just wanna hug someone. We just wanna know Everything's gonna be okay. I don't want him to propose just 'cause he's scared.",Oh.
Her breasts are really tender.,You guys have a hot tub?
No.,She must go to the gym a lot.
Not in years.,Then maybe when you travel on business you zip on down to that complimentary hotel spa.
No.,"Sorry, did you just say yes?"
He doesn't. What's wrong with her?,Sorry. I'm sure she's got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.
What's going on with Cameron?,She doesn't want back on my team and she doesn't want to jump me.
Okay.,"Wha, wha, wha, what? You ask a question. I rule out two possibilities and you're satisfied? That means you don't want an answer. You just wanted to know there wasn't a particular answer. Either you were worried that she wanted back on my team, or you were worried that she wanted back on me."
"This isn't a medical crisis, is it?","Could be. A lot of STDs hang in the balance. I give up. Vinegar compresses four times a day. Any chance I could just leave it at that? No. Pseudomonas folliculitis. It's a skin infection from crowded and contaminated hot tubs, which you obviously use, but not with your husband. Tried to help a sister out."
He's bleeding out.,Means it's gotta be cancer.
"It's gotta be, except it's not. The biopsy was negative.",Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.
All signs point to cancer but you can't blast a cancer you can't find.,Sure you can. Prep him for total body irradiation.
You do realize that's insane.,Not unless you think the cancer's clEverly hiding outside his body.
"And if he doesn't have cancer, we could cause one or destroy his immune system altogether. The guy could die from an infected toenail.","You'd rather do nothing, just let him die on his own?"
That's like pouring gasoline on a fire. At least total body irradiation's an actual treatment.,His idea is better. Pour away.
His idea is better. Pour away.,I lost my mojo.
Have you retraced your steps? Does your cleaning lady check your pockets before ï¿½,I was clueless about Kutner. I was wrong about Cameron. Taub just came up with an idea that I should have seen long before he did.
No one saw anything coming with Kutner. You hardly Ever see Cameron anymore. And you hired Taub to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have come up with.,And I have no idea why you're eating carrots.
Good.,"I'm losing my mind. All you got to say is ""good""ï¿½?"
Nothing on the echo. We drew a troponin lEvel. No signs of myocardial ischemia. All the tests were normal.,"Loss of balance. Pathological hiccups. Air leak between the lungs. Broken femur. Now tachycardia. Go! Come on, give me something. Give me a bad idea. Maybe I can turn it into a good one. Fine. Open him up and put in a defibrillator."
"That's perManent and risky. We don't Even know what, if anything, is wrong with his heart.","Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests."
"Redo all the tests. In the meantime, open him up, put in a defibrillator so he can live long enough for you to finish the tests.","Balance, organs, nerves, lungs, bones, heart."
Things you use to make bratwurst.,There's no sign of infection. It's not a metabolic or autoimmune disease. It's definitely not cancer. I think.
Definitely not cancer.,Aren't you going to pick?
I'm thinking. Is there a ticking clock?,You already put your money in. You nEver do that until you decide.
That's very observant of you. Too bad you distracted me. Now I'm! thinking I might change my mind.,There's nothing healthy in that maParkne.
"No, there's not.",Gummi bears. You hate gummi bears.
People can change.,"No. And more importantly, I hate them."
"Oh, fine. Then I won't offer you any.","You Manipulative bitch. You're not suddenly eating healthy because you want to. You're eating healthy because you know I don't want to. I've been mooParkng food for ten years. Now, either it suddenly started bothering you this week or you're ï¿½"
"Screwing with you. It needed to be done. After Amber died, I withdrew, tried to change Everything, hoping I'd sort it out. Find some deeper truth. It was a mistake. I should have gone back to normal, to here and now, because that's all we can Every really count on. Things need to get back to normal in your life. And! what could be more normal than me screwing with you and you figuring it out?",You Manipulative bitch.
"It means, Even if we figure this out, you'll have to stop protesting anywhere not near a hospital.",Hi! Got a few questions.
"Uh, we're about to start doing ï¿½","A hopefully pointless medical procedure. Your life and my mojo hang in the balance. Pesticides are evil, which means that commercial flowers are doused in evil. But plant life is nature's answer to evil. So you have a garden."
"No, we live in an apartment.","A window box, then."
No.,Potted plants?
Nothing. The commercial growers ï¿½,"Yeah, yeah. They're evil. Yeah, got it."
"House, I really don't think we have time for this.",Your marriage sucks.
Thank you.,All marriages suck. Your marriage sucks.
I love her.,He loves a tree in Oregon more than he loves you. But he can't have sex with it. Unless it's that slutty oak outside Portland.
You wanna get to your point?,"She's had enough. She's gonna leave. Or maybe she's jut not putting out. WhatEver. You gotta make it right, right away. You gotta compromise that precious flower principle."
Once. Three weeks ago. Our anniversary. I missed the dinner to be at that rally. You planned it for months. You were mad. Really mad. I bought you flowers. I brought them home. You were gone. So was your suitcase. I tossed them and bought you the earrings.,"Roses? Yes. You have sporotrichosis. It's an infection from the thorn of the rose which, by any other name, is still a cheap marital aid."
The flowers are what gave me ï¿½,Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve knocks out your balance. Another on your phrenic nerve gives you serial hiccups. We then spread it to your bones and heart with steroids and insulin-like growth factor.
Please tell us that this is good news.,It's good news for him. It's good news for future generations. It's crappy news for you. He's gonna be fine. And he'll nEver doubt himself again.
There you go.,Damn. I was hoping I would interrupt something. Your favor's repaid. Patient's cured. He's already packing for another Earth Day extravaganza next week.
He almost died. He can't take a few days at home with his family?,People only change after trauma if they wanted to change before the trauma. Or if they've watched too Many afterschool specials.
You talking about Chase?,I'm talking about you. You lost husband number one. No surprise that the death of a colleague would make you question another long-term lease.
I told you I nEver wanted to dump Chase.,"Absolutely. You want him to dump you. It's totally different. Much less guilt. Either way, you're out of reasons to avoid him. Kutner was a pretty dumb one to begin with."
House. House. I know you're not asleep.,That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren't just a product of my exhausted brain.
Aren't you curious about why I'm here?,Curious why no French maid's outfit. No spanky pants.
"I'm a hallucination, not a fantasy.",It's insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can causeï¿½
That might explain why you're hallucinating. Doesn't explain why you're hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.,PRobably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.
Or maybe your guilt over Kutner's suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.,"Who cares why you're here. A decent night's sleep, you won't be."
Need some coffee?,Addictive substances are no substitute for nature's healing balm. Make this fast. I need to sleep.
Deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.,"Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear."
Damn imaginary pen.,Mom's signature's on Everything. Did Dad die?
"No, doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical records couldn't be cleaner.",So we're left with temporal lobe seizure.
Someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.,Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.
You're going to ignore your own subconscious? Gonna be the limp leading the blind.,I need a scrip for sleeping pills. My neighbor's dog's been keeping me awake and seems strangely invulnerable to poison. Why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?
Why did he close that file?,Wedding in two weeks? I'd say you were pregnant but I don't think Chase's body is mature enough to produce sperm.
Drugs with no lecture? He wants you out.,Interesting case?
Pencil cup.,Ho! No wonder his prostate's enlarged. It's full of pool cues and cigars.
Chase's best Man doesn't get here till the day of the wedding so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.,No retired ministers available to plan it?
"Chase doesn't want some big, raucous party.","So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what's right."
"No, no, no. I don't want ï¿½ I don't want you toï¿½",Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank! towards the top.
"Doctors, doctors. He can't see. One of his eyes.",The limp leading the blind.
Is that supposed to mean something?,So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.
We should do an angioï¿½,"Knock yourselves out. How did I know he was gonna go blind? Don't get cute, Gazoo. You're in my mind. You're obviously there."
C-reactive protein. I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated. I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation Even higher. Lead to optic neuritis.,"That's a lot clearer than ""the limp leading the blind.""ï¿½"
It was just a glimmer. I couldn't put it into words.,It was a long shot. I don't Even remember the c-reactive protein lEvel.
Obviously you do. You just don't know it.,How high is K2?
I don't know.,"Me neither. But I read a book about it years ago. Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending overï¿½"
"28,251 feet.",Cool. An all-access pass to my own brain.
Go play the kid some music.,Why?
"House, what are you doing?",What does it look like I'm doing? Fighting the power.
"You're an ass. He says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands. What does that mean?",It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.
Thought you were gonna get some sleep.,Case got interesting.
Case got interesting.,Like the zoo. Except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.
How did you know about the neuropathy?,Good question.
Enough with the riddles.,Tell me about it.
"Think ""wrestling record.""ï¿½","Juggling. No, pins. Three pins. Patient was pinned in his last three matches. Leading up to that he was 15 and 0. I figured his balance was off from diminished sensation."
Could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.,That we missed on the head CT?
Cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.,He just went up a weight class three months ago.
Foreman's right.,"Actually, increased ICP could make sense."
You just saidï¿½,I was processing.
It also puts a new symptom on the table.,His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his Parkldhood meningitis?
So meningitis was a coincidence?,Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.
"If you're right about NF2, his deafness may be rEversible. I'll set it up and talk to the Patient.",You two! doing anything?
"Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves. It's not cancer.",Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indiCate a tumor.
No skirts.,You're not on the guest list. Bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.
"Oh, God, not her.",She's the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.
Taub's right. It's not cancer.,"Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it's difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle."
Patient broke his nose years ago. Hospital could have done an MRI.,Okay.
The main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party. Have you seen Caligula?,My Patient's brain now! versus three years ago. See any difference? Is he telling you to avoid the party?
I took an oath to do no harm.,Sure. Don't come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.
This should be interesting.,"You are going to commit to that one special Woman forEver. Which is beautiful. But if your commitment the day after the wedding is the same as your commitment the day before, then the wedding meant nothing. So, and I see no logical way around this, if you want your marriage to matter, you have to be a wanton, trolling, muck-covered pig the day before."
The wall of the fourth ventricle changed. It isn't bowed in the older scan.,"Evidence of NF2, right?"
"You'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm. Uh, I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.",That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.
I'm not going.,Okay.
Do you know who we need? That stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party. You could do body shots right off her.,"Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson's party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers."
She loved cats.,What made you remember the stripper loved cats?
"Ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?",Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What'd you find?
He's going to go through life deaf.,He's okay with that.
He has no idea what he's missing. His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life? Are *we* okay with that?,Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.
Wasn't in the paperwork.,"Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I'll go track it down."
I'll wait.,That's a great idea. Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.
I'll wait.,I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda. An implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.
Her son didn't want the implant.,"If he still doesn't want it, after having time to adjust, I'll take it out. I'll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture."
Remove it now.,Kid's just had brain surgery. He's not stable.
"Understand, Dr. House? House. Focus. I need you to say you accept the arrangement.",No pRoblem. You're not mad.
I'm mad.,Not mad enough. You wanted your son to hear. You just didn't have the guts to make him get the implant.
Why did you do this?,Because he is ignorant and he's being raised by an idiot.
Not good enough. You always haveï¿½,My Patient is opting into a handicap! It's an insult to all the other gimps out there.
Okay. But I'm still putting Foreman in charge of the case.,That's the arrangement? Okay.
You're okay with Foreman in charge? Who you calling? Oh! Right. You don't want to look like a lunatic.,"Yeah, about that!"
You think we did the wrong thing?,I'm not sure. I'm not Even sure why we did it.
"Well, that argument you made to Cuddy sounded pretty good.","To you, maybe."
"To you, maybe.",Huh. I figured by now you'd be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.
Why did you do it?,"Why did I give a huMan being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he'll give you the same answer."
I agree. Taffy?,I agree.
Go ahead. Start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.,Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.
Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,Why aren't you in my office?
"Because I know what the word ""my""ï¿½ means.","I did something insane, and you're not all over me analyzing why."
It was nice.,I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he's been. How is that nice?
Doesn't sound like us.,I know.
And you're okay with that?,What choice do I have?
"Kid's dehydrated but stable. Thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.",Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table. Now eat up. We're gonna pick out the ice cream flavors for the bachelor party.
"Could be systemic autoimmune disease, sarcoido ï¿½ This tastes like! vodka.","Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That's the brown one."
It is vodka?,Flash frozen in a secret process. Guy figured it out in his basement. Limoncello. Genius.
"It happened at night. That was the clue. Night, recumbent body position, changes in BP","It's his heart. Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs."
"It's his heart. Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.",What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.
You're getting better at focusing. Ignoring Everything that doesn't matter. Uh-oh. He looks pissed. I think he might hit us.,Is your eyesight better than mine?
We need to talk about the bachelor party.,Excellent topic choice. Surgery's so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.
It's my fault for letting you talk me into the implant. Cameron is not going to be happy about this party.,"But you, on the other handï¿½"
Plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.,So! I need to cancel the fart band?
So! I need you to kidnap me.,"Spoken like a true Aussie. By the way, if you know where I can get me the sheet music to Waltzing Matilda! Hey. Want some ice cream? We're having a sundae bar."
That's her name.,Sundae or bar?
Karamel.,"With a ""K.""ï¿½"
You still haven't slept?,And then I have a clEver response.
His heart's not fine.,The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia's hiding.
Treadmill.,"Or, the arrhythmia is hiding. We need to stress him. Put the Patient on a treadmill."
The Patient just had brain surgery. A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.,I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.
You're not doing this. You haven't been sleepingï¿½,Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.
"And if I let you risk our Patient's life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.",How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign-off.
We could kill Foreman. Is she new?,Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?
We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.,That's a tough sell since she nEver leaves the room for more than five minutes.
We could kill her. Or! Asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.,REvealing the arrhythmia. Nice idea.
"Actually, I think we just saved it.",Look at that. Arrhythmia.
You were right about the heart. Should have listened to you.,"The correct phrasing would be, ""I should always listen to you.""ï¿½"
"Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear.",Go.
Go.,You sure I did this at Wilson's party?
Last time you used grain alcohol instead of the Sambuca.,And it worked?
This is why we're rehearsing. Ever wonder what's happening Every time our Patient gets sicker?,Not right now!
"First symptom, wrestling. Then, under the lights of the seizure labï¿½",Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feelsï¿½
"Just keep doing what you're doing. It helps. Then, under the stress of blindness! and post-op fEver. What do all the symptoms have in common?","Heat. See, if you hadn't been here that would have just popped into my head. Which actually would have been way cooler. Foreman. The kid's got Uhthoff Phenomenon. Which means it's MS. Start him on double-dose interferon."
Let's get our drink on.,"Not before I've added ""chemical burns""ï¿½ to this guy's cause of death."
Don't let House get him in too much trouble.,Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life.
A-huh.,"Now, ah, a few ground rules for the Evening. Uh, safety is job one. We've now gone for 18 days without an injury in the workplace. Uh, yes, these girls are all working their way through law school. Don't test them."
House!,I knew you couldn't stay away.
This is my apartment. You can't do this.,"Clearly, reality begs to differ."
Where's my furniture?,Out back somewhere.
"You should be out there, enjoying the lap dances of your labors.",Eh. I kinda like it in here.
"Me too. To us, figuring out MS.",And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did. What exactly did my team do?
"House, you in there?",Use the other bathroom. It's in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper's body butter or something.,Is he okay?
"One of the residents had an epi pen, so he's fine but we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.","Okay. I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I? That's why you wanted Karamel at this party."
I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.,I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.
"You're not a big fan of other people's happiness, either.",Hello. You confirm? Thanks. That kid we saved! He's dying. It's not MS. We were wrong.
Turn around. You need to go to the hospital.,I need to sleep.
I'm you. You can't just shut a door.,You tried to kill Chase. I need to push you back down. You're dangerous.
It's the hospital.,Not answering. Hello?
"I'm here with your team, trying to sober them up so they can help treat your dying Patient.",Foreman's dying Patient.
"House, are you there?",It's not eosinophilic pneumonitis. I gotta crash.
"House, don't hang up. We need your help.",I can't.
We can solve this.,Good night.
Usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate. I'll start the meds.,I need sleeping pills. I was gonna hit up Wilson but he's not answering his phone.
"He must have left it in his pants. Which he wasn't wearing when the police found him trying to walk home! oddly, from his own apartment.",Pills.
"Your Patient's doing fine, thanks to your team.","It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?"
Sarcoidosis.,Good.
"House, please talk to me.",I haven't slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.
"Are you going to ignore me all day, again? I help you.",You tried to kill Chase.
"Doing what you wanted. That's all, boss. I exist.","No, you don't. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away."
"Put the phone on the receiver, send the hookers home and get dressed. We've got a case.",I'm taking a personal day.
Twenty-one year old star of the New York Ballet collapsed on stage.,"I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I'm taking a personal day."
How long do you figure until I just! disappear?,Hold on.
House?,STD?
We just said the tests were negative. You think we should!,No.
She's a dancer. What about dehydration?,What about a pulmonary contusion?
What about dehydration?,B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range!
"Hey. I'm just the irrational part of your brain but elevated means high, right? Dehydration could hide an infection.",Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.
The door was closed for a reason.,"Well, now it's open for a reason. We need to talk."
He just told me I have kidney cancer.,Then you'll obviously need a moment to process.
House!,I'm hallucinating.
I'm! I'll be right back.,"I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check Everything I do."
You can't treat Patients.,It's gotta be sleep apnea. I get a good night's sleep and I still feel exhausted. Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.
Do you have any other neurological symptoms?,I don't think so.
Aphasia?,No.
Memory loss?,Nope.
Irritability?,Yeah! That one!
You shouldn't be practicing. At least!,Enough! Don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.
Who were you talking to?,Someone who's not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.
You know he's just going to keep asking.,Kutner.
Good choice. He feels bad.,You gonna help me or not?
I know you're wrong about sleep apnea which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea. You're scared. Tell him you're scared.,Can't sleep with you here.
Did it work?,Do you see someone standing beside me?
No.,"Then, no."
Patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.,So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.
We can't do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.,Trans-tracheal aspiration.
It's a great idea!,"Regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?"
Somewhere between regular and you.,So what's the pRoblem?
Everything okay?,"No. Our Patient can't breathe. Either do the test or come up with a better one. So, we're down to infection, trauma, MS, sParkzophrenia, pills."
SParkzophrenia usually Manifests younger.,That's why it's further down the list. We can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.
"An infection can be treated. Cured. Means you still got a job. Means you still got a life. Doesn't make it a better idea, just a nicer one. This the rational you talking?",Can't do this on my own.
The ANA was negative.,Focus on the lungs.
You want us to ignore the fact that she's lost 80% of her skin?,"We know it's not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy."
We can't just ignore the skin. It's obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.,I don't think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.
By doing what?,I prescribed antibiotics.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis. That's a one in a million reaction.,"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm."
"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",Where the hell were you?
I do have a practice.,Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Are you sure?,About to be.
I'm sorry.,I feel guilty.
"Any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.",I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn't make any sense. Unless there's something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.
Guilt as a symptom?,"It's consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative! I have to apologize. If I feel better then you're right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot."
"It's consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative! I have to apologize. If I feel better then you're right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.",I'm Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?
She's half dead and she's wondering if she'll Ever plie again? Healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.,I'm sorry. I treated you for an infection before confirming that you had one. That's why you lost your skin. I know you're in pain. I know that I caused it. I'm sorry.
Thank you?,Nothing.
Maybe you didn't mean it.,I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?
Couldn't. The artificial skin was too thin. She'd bleed out. Why were you talking to the Patient?,"I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins."
Did you just check with Wilson again?,No. I felt nothing. It's MS.
Apologies aren't supposed to make you feel better. They're supposed to make the other person feel better.,In order to make you feel better.
Why is Wilson here?,You were looking for cancer. I thought it would be helpful for
We didn't find cancer.,Yes. Which you reported to me five seconds ago. Thought I'd let him finish his hors d'oeuvres before getting the bouncer to take care of him.
Tried it. Didn't work. Is Cuddy making him oversee?,No!
Then you're making him oversee your choices. You don't trust yourself. Why?,Wilson. Get out.
Are you sure?,Do I need your approval to throw you out? You happy now?
"It's not MS. SEvere mental illness and Vicodin are all that's left. Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine. Vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.",Are you saying we should kill her?
No.,If we stopped her heart we could get our pictures and then restart it.
What if we can't restart it?,Then she stays dead.
And we only have three minutes until there's brain damage. Sure about this?,Yeah.
Yeah.,We're gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it. I think it was her idea. Pneumonia was her idea and almost killed my Patient.
Ooops.,Kutner was secretly a Woman. That's why he killed himself. It's Amber.
Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?,Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.
It answers questions.,Who cares? I've got competing ideas. They can't both be right.
Everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.,"So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?"
It's on the upper end of you radical. Do you have any alternative?,Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.
Then you're as safe as you can be.,Great. You get the LP results back?
"Yeah. It's a big shock. You don't have MS. But while I had your blood sample, I checked your Vicodin lEvels. Way too high.",I need the pills.
Not an argument. He knows that's not an argument.,It could still be sParkzophrenia.
"House, if you're on anti-psych meds, you're not going to be able to practice.",I know.
You'd prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?,I'd prefer something that could actually work.
"I know that you're afraid of the pain, but electoshock?","Don't give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone."
"Heart attack, stroke, seizure, death or worse.",Worse? Double-death?
Hopefully.,I have an idea.
Stop having ideas.,Insulin shock.
"Yes. That's marginally less dangerous than ECT. Puts you in a coma, could cause!",Could work.
"If you had psychosis, which you don't.","I've had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose."
"Yeah, except the ""I see dead people""ï¿½ thing.",I've been popping pills for years. I've only been seeing things for days. Something changed.
Vicodin addiction is still more likely.,"So, we're no longer dealing in absolutes."
"House, I'll be up in five minutes. Then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.","Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful."
Why?,Because I'm about to put myself into insulin shock.
That's a shadow. Two centimeters!,You're only scared because you know this is going to work.
We're over three minutes.,Yes.
You could have died.,It worked. Where are my pants?
Are you sure?,"She's been Everywhere I've been for days. She's not here, ergo!"
This was not the next rational step.,Now who's being biased? You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted! Forgot how to do my zipper.
Any other neurological deficit?,"You don't seem to annoy me as usual. I'm not sure that's a deficit. And, I'm all better."
Is she really gone?,"Absolutely. I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things. I check out, don't I? Damn."
She'd already been technically dead for three minutes. I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.,Any brain damage?
No. And all tests indiCate that!,Obviously had more time.
Best of luck.,I assume we can't kill her again and take more pictures.
Uhhh. You'll wanna check with Wilson?,Good one.
"Could be an abscess infection. Explains why it's invisible in the blood. It's doing its damage behind closed doors, sealed off.","See, the pRoblem with speculation is you make a speck out of you and some guy named ""Lation""ï¿½ which really doesn't affect me at all."
We have to guess. It's all we've got. We can't do a biopsy. The last time we went into her heart she had a major cardiac Event.,Which just leaves!
What are you looking for?,I don't know yet.
"The picture doesn't change. She lies there in pain. He sits there, worried.",Nothing changes. I just had an epiphany. All by myself. Popped into my head out of nothing.
Care to share?,He's too devoted.
Too devoted? You think he feels guilty?,"Right. I'm being cynical. People can care because they care, not because they cheated. Theoretically true. But gonorrhea fits better."
No. No STDs. We tested her.,Tested her blood.
That is the test.,"That's not where her pRoblem is. Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart. Got walled off in an abscess, it'd be invisible."
And it would look like a shadow.,"No need to test her again when we can check Prince Charming. Once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart."
"Here are your onion rings, extra well done.","Thank you, Molly. And another beer when you get the chance. I'm celebrating."
Alone?,"Thank goodness. Don't tell me, I was right."
Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.,And Everyone's a winner.
"He's not too happy about it. He insists he's nEver cheated, must have gotten it from her.",Don't think so.
Timing would fit. He's got no symptoms and she's dying.,Lying would fit too.
He's not hanging out in her room anymore. What does it matter? You were right. We're prepping her for surgery.,"I saw guilt in him. If he's not actually guilty, then I wasn't right. I was lucky."
"House, you made a brilliant deduction about her heart.",And if I was just lucky!
"Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think. Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink. The years go by as quickly as a wink. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think.",Wilson. Come get me.
I know a nice facility outside Philly. I went to undergrad with one of the directors.,Thanks.
Thanks.,How Many shirts do I need?
Like living with Mom again. Delightful.,It's pRobably Foreman.
He's off the case.,Patient okay?
He's lying.,Why don't I feel scared?
I'd say you're unaware of what you're feeling at this moment.,"I feel like crap. My life if falling apart, but I don't feel scared. Not of the rehab, anyway."
We've always been able to find a way to cheat.,It won't work.
"House, it's your only option.",What do I do if my only option won't work?
You don't give up.,"Hmm. It's either that or electroshock Every six hours. Good night, Wilson."
It's late and I'm tired. Can we get to the talking part of this conversation?,I quit.
"Great. My nanny is off the clock at 7:30 so your week off, bigger desk, tighter nurses' uniforms or whatEver other stupid thing you're about to deMand is going to have to wait until!",You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.
Don't do this.,I'm hallucinating.
From the Vicodin?,Ruled out Everything else.
"We can, uh, admit you through the ER under a pseudonym. No one has to!","I'll cheat, scam, find some way to keep using."
These people know what they're doing.,These people don't know me. You do.
She's not your keeper. She has no responsibility for you.,I need you.
Lie down. I'll get you some tea.,Yeah. That'll be better.
"I already did this room and the bathroom and your bedroom. Where should I look, in the kitchen?",Coffee cup. On the top shelf.
Nicely played. She'll think you've come clean and given her Everything.,There's more.
"House, you should tell me where it is now because you won't have the will to tell me in two hours.",My shoes in the closet.
"Technically, if she dies it's because House has some personal crap to work through and we weren't smart enough to get the answer without him.",False alarm.
Drink this.,That's your advice? Drink this?
It's ginger. It'll ease the nausea.,You know what would calm the nausea? Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma.
"Now, don't pretend you didn't see it. I saw it, which means you saw it. Send her away.",Too bitter. I already have enough bitter.
No!,No! No!
It might be working.,Can you stop? The breathing.
Air goes in. Air goes out.,Then use your nose.
You're supposed to feel like crap. You're doing great.,And after?
You come back to work.,And what if I can't?
Opioid dependency can make you think you have more pain than you really have. You're going to be okay.,You're telling me what I want to hear. With no evidence.
I'm telling you what I beliEve to be true.,With no evidence.
You're hardly the most unbiased observer.,Neither are you. I'm your hospital's biggest asset.
Is that why you think I'm here?,That's why you're here. That's why you're lying to me about!
I haven't lied to you in 20 years.,Sure you have. Which means that you just said that because you want to tell me what you lied to me about twenty years ago.
You're an ass.,Am I wrong?
I wasn't in your endocrinology class.,You sat next to me. I cheated off you in the midterm.
I audited your endocrinology class.,Why would you!?
"Because I thought you were an interesting lunatic, Even then. I'm not here protecting hospital property.",We're alone.
We've been alone all night.,"No, I mean Amber. She's gone."
I'll see you in later? I have some papers to push for you.,Thank you.
"You want to kiss me, don't you?",I always want to kiss you.
Yeah. I think House'll be interested.,"Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ding, ding ding hmm hmm hmm. Just warning you ï¿½ I'm in a good mood. And largely pain free. So I have no idea how things are going ï¿½"
Alien hand syndrome.,Set off by a stroke? Or is there a pony in the backyard?
Split brain. Right hemisphere controls the left and ï¿½,Is making life miserable. Non-logical thinkers often do.
You're dissing the right hemisphere?,"Most people who have this operation don't Even notice they're missing anything. Left brain has language, arithmetic, rationality. Right brain is a mute loser."
Right brain is more aesthetically oriented. Has greater facial recognition. I couldn't have been a plastic surgeon without it.,Yes. And where would junior high be without our ability to Judge people on aesthetics?
"Right brain's also more aware of the present moment, our place in the universe.",It's a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throws buns at people.
"His present symptoms could mean autoimmune disease, nasolacrimal tumor, an infection or just a cold.","Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand new toy. You wanna play?"
We need to talk.,Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else. Begin eliminating. Search the home.
Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else. Begin eliminating. Search the home.,"The, uh! Isn't that like locking the barn door after the horse has put his face between your breasts for an hour and a half?"
I'm your boss. You're an employee.,"Well, I'm not normally into role-playing, but if you wanna!"
"People who get close to you get hurt. That's a fact. You're also a valued doctor in this hospital. That's another fact. From now on, we're gonna focus on the second fact.",So this isn't you freaking out over last night.
This isn't an emotional decision. I'm just giving you the rules. You can either accept them or leave.,I slept with Cuddy. After she helped me detox from Vicodin. I've been clean for almost 24 hours now. Okay. Thought I'd mention it.
Wow. Wow. One for each.,That's what she said. A ha ha ha.
How's the pain?,She's pRobably got some bruising!
"Yeah. I get it. You're a stud. This is serious, House.","I feel better than I did four hours ago. Four hours from now, I'll feel better than this."
The other wow. You were sober. She was sober?,Clean and sober and hot.
Wow. This is fantastic. How are you gonna screw it up?,"SEveral good options. Unfortunately I don't think she's gonna give me the pleasure. She left before I woke up, and five minutes ago she told me that I'm just an employee."
Ha.,Yes.
"Well, either she's actually in love with you and scared, or she realized last night was a gigantic mistake. You were needy and vulnerable. She was maternal.",You think she jumped me out of pity?
"No, I'm saying whatEver's going on you! need to talk to her.",Absolutely.
Did you know that male fruit flies have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid that inhibit the sperm of other males.,Wilson says we need to talk.
We talked.,I agree. This has clearly gotten past the talking stage.
"No, good skin turgor. Not orthostatic.","Could be our tax dollars at work, constantly building new roadways and bridges. A meningioma. Slow growing. Could extend along the subosteal layer of the cranial cavity and be hidden by the bone."
"If you're right, the two halves have begun sending messages again, but it's too early in the process for him to pick up on it. But, we can test for it.",Proof.
"You didn't talk to her, did you?","If I talked, she'd have lied. I'd have lied. And though two negatives make a positive, I thought thermal-imaging photos seemed simpler. Note how Many more heated areas appear after less than a minute with me."
So it's either love or possibly rage.,Don't talk to her.
I have no plans to talk to her.,"Manipulation is in your genetic code. You think I'm making a mistake, you move in to correct it."
You are making a mistake.,She lied to me. Either last night or today. I need to find out which and why.
No communication.,So far.
A few more minutes.,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the left hemisphere! The side that's obsessed with finding answers. The one that needs things to make sense. The interpreter. That's where we tell the story of who we are and why we do things."
"That's also the side that was wrong. Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical. Doesn't choose which details to look at. Makes connections you could nEver see. You owe your insight to the ""mute loser.""ï¿½",I'll send it tickets to a Phillies game.
Confabulation means no communication. Means your theory's wrong.,But he is cold. Why are you scratParkng?
It itches.,Ammonia breath. Your liver is failing.
There's nothing to talk about.,I want permission to do a liver biopsy. We're looking for sarcoidosis.
Fine.,"What do you mean, fine?"
"What do you mean, what do I mean? Do you mean that because a liver biopsy is not a test that, by any stretch of the imagination, can be considered risky, so asking my permission is essentially wasting my time, and you're wondering what my reaction to that will be?",Yes.
Are you trying to make me angry?,Yes.
Do your biopsy. And also do your clinic hours.,I'm blowing off my clinic hours.
"I think you're using your relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs. You should be in more pain so soon into detoxing, but your body's full of roMantic endorphins. And on top of that, you create this distraction of looking for proof.",Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?
Cuddy is not a Vicodin substitute.,Quite the opposite.
You have to wait for her to be ready.,Great advice. You pretend that I'm gonna do that.
You've made two major changes in your life. Not a time anyone's judgment is at its best.,Didn't you use to argue that my judgment would be better off drugs? Admit it. You're curious why I want to make her angry.
"I'm sure it's convoluted, wrong and stupid.",You're dying to know what I found in her coffee cup.
No.,Oxytocin.
Oxytocin. The chemical involved in emotional bonding.,"Her lips say ""no,""ï¿½ her hormones say ""Oh, my God, yes. More!""ï¿½"
"No. For you to know her lEvels were elevated, you'd need a baseline to compare them with.",I paid the guy in the gym to retriEve one of her water bottles from the trash.
Love inspires us to greatness.,"So, I need to make her lose her temper. Which breaks her delusion. Which demonstrates to me and to her that there's something underneath this facade."
And then what happens? She admits Everything and falls into your arms?,That's outcome one. Outcome two is she kills me. I think it's 50/50 right now.
Great.,I thought you'd say that.
You're committing yourself to something. To someone. I mean it's Parkldish in a way but ultimately great. Assuming! Are you absolutely sure you want this to succeed?,Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?
"Eugene Schwartz. Eugene Schwartz. Dr. Cuddy asked me to come up here from the clinic. She says you're seeing Patients in your office. It's still free, though, isn't it?",She sent him. That's gotta mean something.
"I squawk. Like a parrot. Cawwww. No. That's not it. It started a few months ago. I was doing some woodworking in my garage. I was trying to make a chair. Was it the chair? Anyway, all of a sudden, from nowhere, this strange noise comes bursting out of my mouth. Caw, caw. Tough to fake that.",Nice pants.
Points to a clotting issue. Clots would explain all his symptoms. Why aren't we in the office?,"I'm tired of clinic duty. There's only one thing that could cause squawking, right?"
"Yeah. We gave him heparin and did an echo of his heart to see if it was throwing clots, but ï¿½",More air guitar?
"The heart's fine. We wanted to test for Factor V Leiden, Protein C, Protein S but the hand got tired of cooperating. We finally knocked him out.","And all the tests came up negative anyway, or you would have opened by telling me your brilliant diagnosis."
"He apologized for being sweaty, said it had always been an issue but what if it's a symptom? There are cancers that can cause night sweats and can lead to clots ï¿½ lymphoma!",Or pancreatic cancer. Go scan his pancreas. And try Led Zeppelin.
Got a minute?,There's something wrong with this cup.
"I need someone to bounce ideas off of. Someone to be my whiteboard. That's how you taught me to work. I have three choices. First, I can accept it's over, pretend we don't work in the same hospital, have selective visual impairment when we pass each other in the hall. Second, I can accept it's over and leave ï¿½",Or you could try making him angry. Standard choice number three.
"Third, I can talk to him. But it's not like I have any new fact that I can present and Chase has this roMantic view of love that reality can't compete with.",I know how you could succeed.
How?,"Just say the magic words: ""I will destroy my husband's sperm.""ï¿½ Oh, you mean succeed without doing that. PRobably not."
"Patient's girlfriend left him, now he wants to leave us.","If your condo rules don't let you buy insurance, would you go homeless?"
His room is this way.,"What, do you think I can fix this? We need to offer this guy something he can only get if he stays in the hospital ï¿½ relationship counseling."
I don't know if his girlfriend's ï¿½,I mean his two hemispheres. That's the breakfast of relationships ï¿½ the most important one of the day. We need your special skills.
Duct of Wirsung's slightly enlarged but within normal parameters.,Say something.
It's mute. It can't communiCate with you. Maybe you should try communicating with it.,"""Talk to her.""ï¿½ The well isn't deep, is it?"
I'm an oncologist.,Your right brain likes what he's saying. Hasn't moved the entire scan.
"Hasn't gotten us anything, though. Scan's clean. It's not pancreatic cancer.",Clotting could be a pRoblem well before a solid tumor forms. It can still be pancreatic.
"Yes, but if you want a diagnosis backed by actual evidence, we should pRobably look at other cancers.",House.
I just squawked.,What?
"Eugene Schwartz, your Patient from yesterday. I just squawked. I was buying some flowers for Mona. It happened when I was paying the clerk.",I assume Dr. Cuddy gave you this number.
Yes! She told me to call you any time I squawked.,"I'm sorry but I'm about to lose you because I'm about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hanging up the phone. I might be getting some more phone calls, so let's make it fast."
Lymphoma ï¿½,"That's right, pancreatic. I know it's pancreatic. I know there's evidence. I know I've seen it. I just can't ï¿½"
"Right brain, left brain issues?","If the cancer's too small to find, let's make it easier. Let's open him up and paint it. There's a new procedure using scorpion toxin and infrared paint. Paint only works on the cancer cells. Makes 'em easier to spot."
Just agitating the pancreas can cause clotting. And you want to do it to a guy whose pRoblem is clotting?,"If I'm right about pancreatic cancer, the only chance he's got is finding and removing those cancer cells now."
You nEver answered my question.,Relax. Our friendship is not doomed.
Thank God. But my question was do you really want Cuddy or is this just another challenge?,"You're worried that once I'm in a relationship, you and me'll be over."
Have a nice day.,She look angry?
If you're standing there when she looks up here ï¿½,"Oh, no."
Give him a dopamine drip.,You weren't looking up at the right time.
Get to your point. We're a little busy here.,The clots aren't from cancer. They're coming from his heart.
We echoed the heart. No clots.,Not while we were looking. Didn't I open with that? The clots were caused by an arrhythmia.
No arrhythmia.,"Not while we were looking! Intermittent arrhythmia. This guy pulls our equipment off at the slightest provocation. We'd have to be watParkng at the exact moment it happened. Which I'm guessing from the way you two are scrambling around like idiots, is right now. Yes. I'm saying do a transesophageal echo."
We have to get his BP stable.,Absolutely. Right after the echo.
Systolic's 70.,The heart looked healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia wouldn't cause clots in a healthy ventricle. So start with the left atrial appendage.
Wow.,Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy's BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.
Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy's BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.,So what damages a healthy 20-year-old heart enough to make it send out clots like it's bombing Dresden?
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction could interfere with heart rhythm.,Run a dexamethasone suppression test.
We'll just leave the! three of you alone.,Why is there no lipstick on this cup? Cuddy was wearing lipstick when she drank from it. It was on my face. Why isn't it on the cup?
Why is it always reasonable in Houseland to take an emotional pRoblem and sidestep it by turning it into a mechanical pRoblem?,"Because in Houseland, and the rest of the universe, by the way, when a question presents itself, it calls for an answer."
"If the left brain is the interpreter of reality and the one that tells us the story of who we are, then what is your story? Do you wanna be the Man with the answers, or do you wanna be the Man with Cuddy?",What do I do?
You make her angry.,You really think that was the best time to mock me?
"I'm as surprised as you, but I think I'm serious. Communication can't start unless you both ï¿½",I've been trying to make her angry for ï¿½
"I do have trouble giving things up. For example, I nEver canceled any of our wedding plans.","Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Cuddy."
"This is beyond ass-hood! You have the luxury of not caring about your image. I do not! I can permit a lot of crap, but an employee shouting about his sexual exploits with me ï¿½ no! That is zero tolerance! So congratulations, House. I am angry.",I was wondering if we should move in together.
I wouldn't worry about it. I think she likes you.,"If I'm fired, I think that pRobably means I don't have to see Patients."
I'm here as a squeaky wheel. I know how you doctors are. You're busy. You get distracted. My lab results could be sitting in your in-box.,I don't need your labs. You have acid reflux.
Well how could you!,"Acid splashes on the vocal chords, they tense, make that squawking sound. It's completely harmless. I'm gonna give you a prescription and you are gonna go away."
You are a great doctor.,Why'd you move your belt?
I always move my belt. Makes me sore.,You didn't tell me that.
"At 86, what isn't sore? Soreness is less important than squawking. It's the squawking that was bothering my wife.",That's not a potbelly. It's a tumor. That's why pancreatic cancer was on my mind. My brain was trying to tell me!
This isn't sounding good. Pancreatic cancer?,It can cause acid reflux. We should scope you.
"So it's not good. Even for cancer, it's not good.",No it's not.
"The deodorant has a high proportion of propylene glycol. Same stuff made a kid in Singapore dEvelop a heart condition and, get this, seizures. Our Patient may nEver have needed split-brain surgery.",I'm sure he will half-appreciate the irony. Take this Man to radiology. Pancreatic scan. And stay with him.
"WhatEver it is, just say it quickly.",Do you have more than one lipstick in the same shade? Maybe one that has a sealing agent and one that doesn't?
How could that possibly be relevant to anything?,You really don't think you're just! overreacting to the other night?
"Fine. I am overreacting. You've said plenty of lousy things to me before. But reaParkng the final straw has been a good thing because it made me realize we not only don't have a personal relationship, we nEver could.",Wha! You! You're! You've been overreacting to something I said?
You insulted me. I walked out. It's nothing that hasn't happened a hundred times before.,I quit.
Great. My nanny is off the clock at 7:30 so your week off ï¿½,You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.
Screw you.,"No, no. That ï¿½ that's not what happened. I told you that I needed you. You ï¿½ You helped me."
Too bad it isn't true.,No. I'm not okay.

So hire a team.,What for? I don't have a case.
Have you Even interviewed anybody?,You test drive a car before you buy it. You have sex before you get married. I can't hire a team based on a ten-minute interview. What if I don't like having sex with them?
You've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing. Concert is over.,In what twisted universe does mastering Eddie Van Halen's two-handed arpeggio technique count as absolutely nothing?

I'll check the bedroom.,Some interesting mold on the windowsill here! It's gonna take me a while.
I'll cover the bathroom.,She had a secret diary.
Is there any other kind?,What're you doing?
There's a sale on Liquid Tide.,"If you're broke, I can lend you a tiny bit of the money I owe you."
"No, no, I wouldn't put you in that position. What does the diary say?","It's basically a list of her sexual encounters. Boys, girls, vibrating appliances."
"If it was, you'd be quoting, not summarizing.","This is a parade of sad banalities. ""I can hardly get out of bed. Feeling blue."" Then, three months ago, turns into a parade of happy banalities. ""Starting to turn the corner. Job's looking up."""
We can stop swabbing. Her clichï¿½s are getting healthier.,Or she's less depressed. Aren't there pills that do that?

"If I was going to fire you, I wouldn't be giving you the lecture. I know you're not going to let anything like this Ever happen again. I'll see you tomorrow.",And I'm sorry to say... I told you so.
It's House.,"Gooood morning, Angels."
"Gooood morning, Angels.","As you will see from the file, we have quite the interesting case. Not often do you get a Patient who sees dead people."
"Uhh, what file?",What the hell? I gave it to Bosley a half hour ago.
It was not a half hour. It was ten minutes. And he made copies of the ER records first.,"Less lip, more whip. I only agreed to take this case because you said that this Mocha Frappalicious would have whip on it."
Fine. I'll refer the case to Foreman.,Can't. Mercy fired him.
Can't. Mercy fired him.,Gimme.
He got fired?,Disobeyed a superior Officer under fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.
How do you know about it? You keeping tabs on him?,Girls talk.
Girls talk.,When Bosley drags his ancient ass in there...
You mean it appeared normal to the doc in the ER.,"Way to get right back on that horse, ""Thirteen""."
"Way to get right back on that horse, ""Thirteen"".","Nice try, Cutthroat Bitch. That was the worst ""Thirteen"" imitation I've Ever heard."
"You said one of us wasn't a doctor, and you called him a fraud.","He's not a doctor. Continue, Boz."
Why isn't he fired?,"Oh, you're breaking up. I'm going into a tunnel."
"Oh, you're breaking up. I'm going into a tunnel.",Dark religious nut.
What did you call me?,I'm sorry. What do you people want to be called this week?
Cole.,I'm nEver gonna remember that. Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home.
I'm nEver gonna remember that. Take Bosley and the other visible minority to the funeral home.,"The rest of you young white people, the world is your oyster. Get an MRI with contrast, EEG, LP, and blood panel. And, Angels, be careful."
Just because he's religious doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.,You wanna bet?
"No, I want you to stop being such a jerk to him.",One hundred dollars.
One hundred dollars.,Smart call. Guy's a wuss. He's gonna be the next one on the train.
"Define ""kick your ass.""",Any physical confrontation...
Or verbal?,Define verbal.
Anything over...sEventy decibels. And you can't start suddenly being nice to him.,You realize what you're encouraging here.
Ethanol can have psychoactive effects...,Bosley! Tell whoEver's talking he's an idiot.
Bosley! Tell whoEver's talking he's an idiot.,"Bosley. Either tell him he's an idiot, or tell me why I'm wrong."
You're an idiot.,You actually think that I'd take a Patient who had a seizure in a funeral home if the ER hadn't already ruled out embalming fluid?
I thought we weren't supposed to trust...,"Idiot! From the old French, ""idiote"", meaning effeminate, mentally deficient moor."
"I found something in the mortuary's files from '05. A forty-eight-year-old male's cause of death was listed as pneumonia, but the symptoms in the autopsy report didn't fit. Uh, confusion, memory loss, depression.",Mad cow. Very cool.
"No, she's a vegetarian and only ate organic vegetables at that.",Tell him he's an idiot again.
The disease can be spread by brain tissue.,Which is very cool. Run with it.
"So because the answer might be ""cool"", you want us to do a brain biopsy on a twenty-four-year-old Woman?","No, because the answer is something cool, I want you to do a brain biopsy on a forty-eight-year-old dead guy."
I am not digging up a body without a court order.,Don't think of it as digging up a body. Think of it as keeping another one from being buried.
I can't do it.,We gonna have another one of those ecumenical discussions where I tell you that your beliefs are ridiculous and you totally cave?
I just gotta be home at six.,"The Sabbath. The Lord works for six days, then tells the Union he needs a rest. You know, if I was all-powerful, I'd take at least two days."
"The Sabbath. The Lord works for six days, then tells the Union he needs a rest. You know, if I was all-powerful, I'd take at least two days.","Well, then it must be the kid."
"Well, then it must be the kid.",You have oatmeal on your pants.
Do you have a camera in here?,No. I was guessing. He had oatmeal on his pants yesterday and the day before. Have one of your wives look after the spawn.
I have no idea.,"Interesting. You claim a lapse of judgment, or you gonna admit that a lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?"
He's gone.,Fair enough. Family comes first.
The doctor's lounge is covered in mud.,"Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch had a disagreement, and the cafeteria was out of jell-o."
"There were pickaxes. Either you had them dig up a body, or you're building a railroad.",A little tiny piece of his brain. Seemed a waste. He wasn't using it anymore.
"That's your defense? ""We just dismembered him""?",They're looking for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
You get the results yet?,Does my breath smell bated to you?
Yes. Let me know when you hear anything. And get that mess in the shower area cleaned up.,I know just the guy.
How Many of them agreed to dig up a grave?,Six.
Six.,"But don't worry, the one who didn't didn't stand on principle. He just had a diaper to change. I really think there are no bad choices in this group."
"But don't worry, the one who didn't didn't stand on principle. He just had a diaper to change. I really think there are no bad choices in this group.",You guys don't wipe your feet when you come in the House?
You guys don't wipe your feet when you come in the House?,Doctor's lounge. Let's go.
Why me?,"Well, I can't ask the black guy or one of the Parkcks to do it. That would be insensitive."
And you can't ask Bosley because that'd look like you only hired the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.,"You keep stalling, you're still gonna clean up, but I won't let you have the mop."
Sample came back negative for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.,"Well, that discussion didn't last long."
I just don't know what else there is. We had an idea. It was wrong.,"Well, we can go home. I mean, we have no idea what's wrong with her. Which means it could be completely benign. Or, on the off chance that it's _killing_ her, we could take it again from the top."
What are you talking about? She's right there.,"You sampled Every bodily fluid, peeked in her brain, violated a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body..."
"You sampled Every bodily fluid, peeked in her brain, violated a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body...",... but missed the fact she was still seeing things that weren't there.
... but missed the fact she was still seeing things that weren't there.,Be nice if one of you Angels-slash-morons had a clue why.
We did a full history. She nEver mentioned seeing or hearing anything unusual.,"Oh, well, as long as she nEver said anything. How were you to know? Same thing with the spinal fluid? She tell you that was fine?"
The labs were all clear.,"Then either we're about to meet the Alpha and Omega, or you missed something."
Seeing her dead mother's a hallucination. Not knowing she's dead is a delusion.,"You keep this up, you're gonna have to start wearing sexier clothes."
"In Ukraine, twenty years ago. Good luck trying to get those records.",We start new records. Test for Every hereditary disease that fits the symptoms.
"There are at least forty different mitochondrial disorders, another couple hundred...","Start with Amyloidosis, keep going until you reach... zAmyloidosis."
"And you tell him that, then run back to your office while I get to deal with him. I left for a reason. That reason hasn't changed.",So... what's the news?
Everything's negative so far.,"Yes. Why wait to finish before reporting to me? I have things to do, you know."
She's seeing someone else.,"That's not news. That's ""olds""."
"That's not news. That's ""olds"".",Dammit. Why did God design the huMan body this way?
A guy in a wheelchair.,In a hospital. It's enough to give you the heebie-jeebies.
He had a dog. She's seeing Stark. Our last Patient.,"Well, if it's Stark, he wouldn't be haunting a Patient, he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him."
"Well, if it's Stark, he wouldn't be haunting a Patient, he'd be haunting the doctor who killed him.",PRobably? You think there's a possibility that the alternative is true?
PRobably? You think there's a possibility that the alternative is true?,Then go away.
We're wasting time. We ran thirty two gels. We could run a hundred more. Without knowing how her mother died...,"You're gonna have to run a hundred more. And by you, of course, I'm only referring to the people who care enough about huMan life to put in a full day. You wanna carpool?"
H-how do you expect me to respond to this stuff?,Exactly like you just did. I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out. Black Mormon means masoParkst. Means kinky.
Exactly like you just did. I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out. Black Mormon means masoParkst. Means kinky.,I'm thinking that someone got hurt making the bastard. Am I right?
You leave my son out of this.,I wasn't referring to your kid's hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.
"I don't mean ask the Patient, I mean ask her mother.",Cool.
Cool.,Come on.
Now what?,I'm Dr. House. 'S your mom around?
Why should I tell you? You're just going to tell me I'm lying or crazy.,Not gonna do that. I really need to know what she has to say.
What do you want?,"When you were young, was she...?"
"Actually, looks like you.","Yeah, that's Grandpa House. Tell him to call back on a land line. Terrible reception in here. How much pain was your mom in?"
Can I... help you?,My Patient's talking to my Grandpa Walt.
You have a Grandpa Walt?,Nope. Which is what made me suspect that maybe she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.
What is this sudden obsession with the afterlife?,Only obsession is with the idiots in the right-here-and-now life who think there's an afterlife.
And you want me to...?,Nothing. Just need a place to hang low for awhile. I'm pretending to be spooked.
Because...?,"Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead Patient thinks that I beliEve her, maybe she'll let me chat with her mother's ghost."
The one you don't beliEve exists.,"Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination, which is the result of a delusion which most likely is the result of a hereditary disease that her mother died from when the Patient was four."
And you think you can tap into her subconscious memory by tapping into her hallucination.,"Hmm-mm. She might not know what caused her mother's death, but she will know how she acted before she died."
"You're quite impressed with yourself right now, aren't you?","Who wouldn't be? Well, that should be long enough. Back in a flash."
Take your time.,Is my grandfather still here?
He just went to get some warm milk.,"But your mom's still here, right?"
"Yes, of course.","I know she's fine now, but when you were four or five, she got sick."
No.,You sure? She wasn't in any pain?
She was just tired. And sometimes she would stay in bed all day.,Did she Ever fall down?
Sometimes. Not that often.,How often?
They took her away.,"Yeah, to the place where the doctor made her better. But before that, what about her arms and legs? Did she Ever walk funny? Like sort of bent over?"
I thought that was from growing up on the farm.,"What about her hands? She Ever have any difficulty sewing, buttoning a shirt?"
She used to get the shivers like she was cold.,Start her on l-dopa and bromocriptine. It's just Parkinson's.
Lesions aren't explained by Parkinson's.,Any theories?
Any theories?,A ghost got your tongue?
"So are the banks and the power grid. But if I don't pay my bills, my lights go out.","Vasculitis restricts blood flow to nerves, messes with electrical function."
"If you're wrong about porphyria, the treatment could box her kidneys. Vasculitis is treated with corticosteriods. Relatively harmless.",Start her on the steroids.
House...,And test for both so he'll stop whining.
And test for both so he'll stop whining.,"Big Love, have I humiliated you in the last half hour?"
No.,Check your email.
How's it going?,Great. The only way he could turn any more cheeks is by pulling down his pants.
He's not a wuss. It takes a lot more strength...,"Hey, we didn't bet on how strong he was."
So you're gonna collect a hundred dollars and fire him because he has principles?,What's your agenda here? Obviously don't care about the hundred.
"He's a decent, smart...",You don't care about the team.
Does it annoy Wilson when you ask questions and ignore the answers?,"Very much. You only care about who I hire and who I fire, 'cause you miss going through my mail. You can't stop controlling me."
No one controls you.,Want your job back?
No.,Too bad. You can't have it.
Too bad. You can't have it.,She'll take care of this.
She'll take care of this.,You can take it out of the $100 you're gonna owe me.
Not a metaphor. Look up.,You guys gonna shoot the breeze or you gonna do something about all that bleeding?
"PBG tests are only conclusive if done during an attack, which you would know if you were a real doctor.",That is just great.
Which one of us is?,"Both of you. Together. Fighting. Passionate to prove the other one wrong. Couldn't care less about the Patient, but it all works out the same."
"I hate ""Thirteen"".",Not as productively. Continue.
Vascular isn't just vasculitis. Something's gotta be cutting off the blood supply to her liver and spleen.,Do a visceral angiogram.
"This is a joke, right? He can't be right Every single time. You're feeding him your ideas just to embarrass us.","If I wanted to embarrass you, I'd... have you mop up the doctor's lounge."
"No, give it to me! I want it! Give it to me!",What'd the angio say?
We couldn't finish. She started groping me.,You couldn't let her get to second base just to get the test done?
"She was convulsing, delirious, and hyper-salivating. We had to knock her out with lorazepam.","Well, it's definitely not vascular."
What do you want us to do?,"Question is, what would Joseph Smith do?"
This isn't the time for...,Casting out the demons?
"The Patient's not possessed, she's dying. You can mock me tomorrow.",You beliEve that the Book has all the answers.
"To morality, not science!",But the book is inconsistent with science. You know how Many epileptics were tortured because they were possessed? How Many teenage witches were stoned to death 'cause they took mushrooms?
Just shut up already! We got a Patient dying!,Either got to prescribe an exorcism or admit to me that Smith was a horny fraud.
I know what she has.,You couldn't have spoken up ten seconds ago? You coulda saved me a hundred bucks.
... completely unprocessed and untreated like what's in that organic rye bread she's been eating. Should I be going home?,Is it six o'clock?
Cravings based on actual needs. It's a fairly common evolutionary dEvelopment.,You okay with an answer based on evolution?
Yeah.,Hypocrite.
Mama.,"As you know, there are sEven of you and... only six roses."
But I'm sure they're part of the rose family.,"Actually, I'm surprised there are sEven of you. You punch your boss and stick around?"
Gimme the flower and shut up.,"Don't overdo it. Now I would love to keep all of you. But not enough to do anything about it. So according to my arbitrary schedule, one of you has to go."
"No, I nEver...",I'm sure she did it. That's why she's getting the flower. It was beautiful.
I'm sure she did it. That's why she's getting the flower. It was beautiful.,She just overreached. She got into your head.
She just overreached. She got into your head.,"She owned you. Planting the idea was good. Letting it fester was good. Leaving the collar was stupid. Well known fact, ghosts don't leave things lying around."
"She owned you. Planting the idea was good. Letting it fester was good. Leaving the collar was stupid. Well known fact, ghosts don't leave things lying around.","Oh, my goodness. I'd totally forgotten about you two. Well played."
"Oh, my goodness. I'd totally forgotten about you two. Well played.","Sorry, Henry."
"Sorry, Henry.",We had some giggles.
That's why I gotta go. Don't need someone to tell you what you're already thinking.,"Funny, I was gonna say that."
"Funny, I was gonna say that.",If you want to hang out...
"Yeah, I know. Um, call Wilson.","Rest of you, eight o'clock tomorrow."
Cash will be fine.,I bet you say that to all the guys.
I bet you say that to all the guys.,Take your blood money.
Take your blood money.,Who are you gonna protect next?
Are you happy? Let's go!,"Today, we are hunting for the cat burglar of diseases. Causes a healthy Man's lungs to fail, leaves no fingerprints."
Respiratory distress could be asthma.,No hyperinflation on the X-ray.
Food allergy. Could have eaten shellfish or peanuts.,No hives. No erythema on the skin.
No hives. No erythema on the skin.,Embolisms don't magically dissolve. What are you doing here?
"Laryngospasm. Frosty fall air hits his vocal chords, they spasm shut... Choke him out.","Good idea. You've been tremendously helpful, you can leave."
I just hired him.,Well I fired him. To infinity.
You didn't tell him I was coming back?,"She did, I said no."
"It's still Dr. House's department. He decides who stays, who goes...",Foreman goes!
But Dr. Foreman will be my eyes and ears. You do nothing without his knowledge.,"Oh, uh, just in case I need them, where exactly will Dr. Foreman be keeping my balls? If you want to keep your jobs, that nEver happened. The only way to get the cat burglar is to catch him in the act. Give the Patient a methacholine challenge, see if it sets off laryngospasm."
You want us to stop his breathing?,"Well, only until you can figure out why. After that it'd be irresponsible. You and I should talk."
"I'm sorry, she didn't have to do that publicly.","Yes she did! She had to establish her dominance in front of them, limit my power."
There's nothing we can do.,"Well, that's not the nEver-say-nEver Dr. Foreman I know. There's lots we can do."
"Not really, Cuddy won't...",I can make you miserable.
That's true.,"Until you quit, again. So why don't we just skip the middleMan?"
I'm not quitting.,"My god, not Everything's about you, and your little job, and your little world. This is about restoring order in the universe."
I'm not quitting.,You're going to be miserable.
Doesn't cover all three. What else?,"Carry on, he's the boss."
Have to be in the brain stem and it still doesn't explain the lungs.,"Weird, though... That he's the boss. Didn't he quit recently? Was it a money issue?"
"Lungs, stomach, numbness?","No that wasn't it, it was something else... Was it bling account? Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?"
We have to unify these symptoms.,Oh! I remember. You don't want to turn into me. Right? You didn't want to become evil.
Can we stick to the medicine here?,"Absolutely. I'm just flattered. In a few short weeks, seems like I've just turned towards the light. I mean... either that or you've sold your soul."
Multiple marantic emboli could...,"Get a raise? 'Cause then you're a whore. Or didn't you? 'Cause then you're a stupid whore. Patient just crashed. Can they go, boss?"
You're right.,But?
No but. You're right about all of it.,"Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion."
"Okay, while you're killing him... I'll get the intubation kit.",I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position. There's no point in me humiliating you.
Thanks.,"So I'm going to humiliate Cuddy, until she fires you."
Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's. You notice the EMT run sheet? Paramedic who brought him in is also named Martin Harris.,"Well. If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel, I'd say you might be on to something."
"Look. Room 406, abdominal pain. Room 403, left-sided numbness. 402, syncope. He's copying his neighbours' symptoms.",No.
"Yeah, coincidence is much more likely than you being a stubborn jerk.","Munchausen's Patients create symptoms, not names."
See? Nothing's wrong with him.,"He's in a lab coat. Munchausen's pretend to be Patients, not doctors. He's got mirror syndrome."
Giovannini's?,"Do you know another mirror syndrome? Brain's got no idea who he is, where he is or what he is. But it fills the holes with whatEver dirt's lying around. He reads a name tag, he's got a name. Sees a doctor, he's got a job. Sees symptoms, he's got a pRoblem."
My explanation's simpler.,"Well if it's simple, then we discharge the nut bar. But if it's compliCated, then the nut bar has got brain damage."
So we let him jerk them around for a few days until we're sure?,"No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way."
"No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way.",Mind if we play through?
"Sure, what could possibly go wrong?","What's going on here, Martin?"
"House, who is this guy?","Excellent question. Who are you, Martin? He just likes to watch, do stuff."
"Number ten scalpel for initial incision. Glad you're here, House.",Of course you are. It's lecture time.
"Yeah, it is. Stop worrying about the power play.","Was that it? I think you can go a lot deeper here. I mean, WHY am I so obsessed by all of this?"
"You're threatened by Foreman and feel the need to impress Cuddy. The only thing that's relevant is Foreman is a good doctor. He can help you, lighten the load.",Good idea. I'll have him sort my mail.
Who is this guy?!,I think we just found out.
Hah.,Told you I didn't need you.
Owww!,"Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die. Can't fake that!"
"Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die. Can't fake that!","Mirror syndrome Patients have no agenda, no axe to grind. They can read you because they have to. Moods, attitudes, Everything. They're like mind readers. Except they can read your mind."
Where are we going?,"Unfortunately, we have to cure him. His hand wasn't black when he came in, the operating room was sterile, the only thing different was the temperature. Cold agglutinins means..."
"No fEver, so it's got to be a tiny infection, hard to find.","You'd better find it fast. This guy feels another cool breeze, his blood turns to slop and he drops. I need three ways to pinpoint infection."
Blood cultures.,Blood's clumpy. Nothing you can do with it.
Unless we soak him in warm water before we draw it.,"Good, what else?"
"Ultrasound his abdomen, look for an abscess.","Good. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I have a regrettable announcement. Kitchen has just learned that our annual shipment of mayonnaise was improperly stored, so anybody who ate... well, the food, should head across the lobby to the clinic right away. Ask for Dr. Cuddy."
"You're not punishing Cuddy, you're punishing Every doctor in the building.","It's her building, her doctors. Still need one more."
The mayo is fine. You can stay where you are. I'm a doctor.,Mail order. I've seen the diplomas. Two N's in university. Big Love was right. History's the key.
"No ID, no wallet. No missing persons report filed for a hundred miles.","The key is the key. He had car keys in his pocket when he was admitted. Keep him in the isolation room, so he doesn't pick up extreme bitch syndrome from one of the nurses. Run the ultrasound and the blood cultures."
The cultures were my idea.,"No one's keeping score... You're losing. Search the street where he was mugged, find the car and the registration."
There could be thousands of cars. Why do I get this assignment?,"Because if you deal with the Patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once."
"Because if you deal with the Patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once.",Ooh. We have a love connection.
Lesion on the liver. Cystic or solid?,Solid.
"Well, you certainly did the right thing by coming to me.","Yes, I needed a smug oncologist..."
An authoritative oncologist.,I hate you. Tell me why.
"I've been scanning literature, very interesting study in Sweden. Apparently, Giovannini's Patients mimic whoEver they think's in charge.",Any country with that low an age of consent and that high a rate of suicide isn't thinking straight.
I am in charge of our relationship.,It was a surgery. You were the surgeon. In that setting...
You would pick up my laundry if I asked you to.,"Go ahead, ask."
"Oh, I wouldn't do that to you.",I want all my personal private doctors back right now. Except for Foreman.
"Your team, Foreman included, is dealing with the great mayonnaise panic of 2007. Frankly, I'm worried it might spread to other continents.",Lesion on the liver. Possibility... Why are you doing a pelvic for food poisoning?
She said her hoo hoo burned.,"Lesion on the liver, ideas?"
"Unless it's a vascular heMangioma. Aspirate that, he'll bleed out, we'll kill him.",If he bleeds out we'll know what he had.
Had?,Two diagnoses out of three he lives. We do nothing three out of three he dies. Go stick his liver.
Where's Foreman? We should...,You need him to draft your letter of resignation?
You risking our Patient's life to get back at Cuddy?,"What? No, that would be Parkldish. This is what I'm doing to get back at Cuddy. Who here doesn't have any health insurance? Michael Moore was right. MRI's, pet scans, neuro-psych tests, private rooms for all these Patients. Fight the power!"
"I think the black pus is fungal. If I'm right, that's where the cold agglutinins are coming from, that's what's driving his memory loss. Amber's putting him on amphotericin, it will cure him.",This makes no sense.
"I'm doing blood tests to be sure, but the sooner we get him on...",I'm not talking about the infection. I'm talking about you letting Tonya Harding administer the treatment.
I'm out of the game.,Why?
"A couple of weeks ago you named me grumpy, said I didn't want to be here, I wanted to be back in the Third world.",And you realised I'm right just now?
I got a confirmation.,The Patient's nuts.
The Patient's... unbiased. The Patient has no axe to grind.,The Patient is nuts.
"I miss my old life helping people who barely have clean water, let alone the kind of medicines we waste by the SUV load.","You're nuts. You're going to be miserable, at home, at work, somewhere. The goal in life is not to eliminate misery, it's to keep misery to the minimum."
"Oh, that's inspiring.",You said you came back to get married. What does your fiancï¿½e do?
She's a court reporter.,"Uh-huh, well I'm sure Thailand will have courts any day now. Someone's going to be miserable sometime. Accept it. It's how I stay so happy."
Why do you care if I stay?,You're good. Don't screw it up just because you're miserable.
"Heating blanket wasn't keeping him warm enough. Ordered a whirlpool, got his blood flowing. So far, it's keeping his rash at bay.",Rash worse equals cold agglutinins worse. Means what was in his liver wasn't fungus.
"That it wasn't Even pus, it was just coagulated blood caused by the cold agglutinins.",Which you mistook for a cool fungus that you saw after the tsunami.
Same consistency...,"You saw what you wanted to see, not what was there. Wait a second. Didn't you quit?"
"I spoke to my fiancï¿½e, I'm staying.",Of course you are. Because you're the exact right amount of miserable.
"We could repeat all the cultures, maybe we just missed it.",Or... we can get an accurate history.
Or... we can get an accurate history.,"Well, that'll be a good solace to the widow X."
"Well, that'll be a good solace to the widow X.","That's why I sent two of you. One of you breaks in, the other posts bail."
"That's why I sent two of you. One of you breaks in, the other posts bail.","Not a pRoblem. You know how to kill dogs, right?"
"So, back to repeating all the cultures.",Or... we get an accurate history.
Didn't we just rule out that possibility?,"You guys Ever heard any of my metaphors yet? Come on. Sit on grandpa's lap as I tell you how infections are criminals, the immune system's the police... Seriously, grumpy, get up here. It'll make us both happy. Anyway, cops don't just let crooks run free. They keep fingerprints, mug shots. The immune system does the same thing, only it calls them antibodies. We find out what diseases he's had in his life, good chance that'll tell us where he's been in his life. Alice. Your turn through the looking glass. Draw blood and CSF."
Where were you?,What do you have?
High titers to histoplasmosis.,PRobably lived in the Ohio river valley.
Also weakly positive on coccidiomycosis.,Weak means older. Means he moved to Ohio from the San Joaquin valley.
He's also positive for Chagas disease.,Central America.
Or he kissed his maid from El Salvador. Or he sat next to someone from Belize on a flight to Weehawken or he ate lettuce from Honduras...,"Yes! You're right, buzz kill. This tells us next to nothing. But since that's on the something side of nothing, thought we'd go with it."
His rash is back. Hot tub isn't hot enough to keep his body warm.,So we take his body out of the picture. Let's hit it from the inside. Lipopolysaccharide.
"LPS won't just give him a fEver. He could hit 110, fry his brain.",Or make him just toasty enough to keep his blood flowing free. Like my bowels. You smell that? Not going to get sweeter.
You nailed Brennan for seeing what he wanted to see. You're no different.,But you are. You used to like this stuff. You left here because you didn't like what you were turning into. You like who you are now? You like being Cuddy's errand boy? That was just a courtesy flush. I'm not actually done.
You want to induce a fEver?,"Unless you're willing to don a white T-shirt and hop into the hot tub with him, I need another way to keep him warm, or he dies."
You could maim him.,I could cure him.
I'm not letting you do it.,Are you going to fire me?
No.,"Wait a second. What the hell was that? You were won over by my soaring rhetoric? I basically just threatened to hold my breath... You nEver intended to stop me. You just pretended to stop me, so you could pretend to fail to stop me, so you could stroke my ego. Uh-Uh. War doesn't end till Foreman's gone."
Foreman's not going anywhere.,And... I know when my Vicodin isn't Vicodin. Do you know when your birth control pills aren't birth control pills?
Cardiac arrest. We were able to shock him back to a normal sinus rhythm and Kutner nearly into a coma.,So now you've electrocuted yourself and set a Patient on fire. I like the dedication.
It wasn't a compliment.,"Yeah, it was. The insult comes now. You're insane! You either have an aversion to towels, or you want pain. I think both. I'm thinking it goes back to high school gym..."
Anybody think we should discuss which infection is causing the cold agglutinins before they stop his heart again?,"Sure, why not?"
Nothing on the blood cultures.,Do them again. Quadruple run time.
"Yeah, yeah... We biopsy his toe instead!","No! That's a terrible idea. Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on, I'll join you."
"No! That's a terrible idea. Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on, I'll join you.",I got you a job. Mount Zion hospital in Boston.
They have a great diagnostics department.,Gilchrist said he'd take you anyway.
That was... Very nice of you.,"Oh, god. Does Everything have to be about you? It's simple math. I'm not going to back down. You're not going to back down. Cuddy's not going to back down. No one's going to be happy here. And Cuddy's going to end up pregnant."
What?,Doesn't matter.
Are you saying? What does you having sex with...,Starts Monday. I could help you pack.
I don't want the job.,What? Why not? You're miserable.
Apparently not.,"Well, you're gonna be. Are you smiling?"
No.,Do your own stupid biopsy.
Here's Everything he had in his trunk and in his glove box.,No need for the heart biopsy. I now know exactly who he is and what he has. You saved his life.
Really?,"No, you idiot. It's vapour rub and lunch receipts."
"We have his name. We can find his doctor, get his medical records.","It's 8:00 at night. The biopsy will be faster. Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point. Thirteen. Is your name Thirteen? Why did you volunteer to go street walking?"
"It's 8:00 at night. The biopsy will be faster. Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point. Thirteen. Is your name Thirteen? Why did you volunteer to go street walking?",A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there. Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here. Didn't want to look in the mirror?
A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there. Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here. Didn't want to look in the mirror?,Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you to iron her shirts. We'll take over. Go ahead. Talk to him.
Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you to iron her shirts. We'll take over. Go ahead. Talk to him.,Come on. Make him feel comfortable.
My god. You are incredibly hot.,"I'm not here, deal with her."
Are you an idiot? Do you not think she's hot?,I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.
I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.,Increase the drip. If... you think that's the right thing to do.
This is so frustrating.,"Hey. Get in there, see how he's doing."
You were just in there.,"Well, apparently, it's impossible to see anything else while I'm in there. I'm a blinding white hot light of power."
"No. No, it's not.","No, I'm not interested in how he's doing. I'm interested in how she's doing. So get in there and tell me how he's doing."
You think he'll mimic her if I'm in there with her?,"You're a powerful, dominating Man, but who knows?"
So I'm going to get fired before her.,"Yes, you're going to get fired right now unless you get in there..."
"Yes, you're going to get fired right now unless you get in there...",And how is he?
And how is he?,I know. But how is he? Bitter? Sexually frustrated?
He needs the meds and the tub. Just to keep him stable.,Fine. Soak him again.
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.,"No, you love hot tubs. Find the rest of the gang, tell them to meet me at the lecture hall."
Hate hot tubs.,What did you say?
I hate...,He likes. Who else was in there?
No-one.,You didn't think to mention that?
"The guy likes warm, swirling water. I didn't know that was diagnostic.","It's not. What it is, is the water hit him and he had a thought. Not about you, but about him. We need to splash him some more."
Do I know you?,You look familiar.
You too.,"My name's Robert Elliot. I'm from Hamilton, Ohio."
Me too. What do you do?,Stuff.
Me too.,What brings you to New Jersey? Is it work or vacation?
Uh... Work.,What type of work?
I'm tired.,I eat out a lot. In a lot of restaurants. Knotty Pine. RitParkes.
I know those places.,"They're good, huh?"
They're convenient.,For what?
They're on the road.,You on the road a lot?
No more than you I suppose.,You Ever use this stuff? I use it all the time.
I use it all the time.,"Yeah. I just said that. You know, the cool thing about this stuff is... You can do a lot with it. Soften your skin, treat scrapes. Naughty stuff. Why did you do that?"
Because... It doesn't smell like dung.,You're saying you like the smell?
Not really. Just doesn't smell like dung.,Something else does smell like dung?
Yeah. Dung.,"You guys ready? Now is the time you stare at me, in slack-jawed amazement. He sells farm equipment. See? Pig lagoons, pig farms. And, as Every Parkld knows, where you have pigs, you have pig poo. But as very few Parkldren know, where you have pig poo, you have eperythrozoon infection."
"You guys ready? Now is the time you stare at me, in slack-jawed amazement. He sells farm equipment. See? Pig lagoons, pig farms. And, as Every Parkld knows, where you have pigs, you have pig poo.

"Hi, I'm the Dean of Medicine.","Hi, I'm the guy who saved your life."
I can fire him. I can fire him now. I can fire him tomorrow. I don't Even need a reason.,"She doesn't fire me, she nEver will fire me, she needs me."
"He's a good doctor. That's all. I respect his expertise, and I...",She's hot for me. Always...
That still could have been either of us.,You lose.
Damn.,"You all suck. The two of you, took 14 hours to find a car. You, forgot to mention that the guy with no memory, had memories. You keep on thinking, that insane guys have hidden wisdom. You're going to wind up shooting people on the subway. Something."
"So, which one of us sucks the most?",It's a tie.
Between?,All of you.
We're all fired?,None of you are fired.
That was nice of you.,Sure.
Why didn't you fire anyone?,They're good doctors.
"Right, why didn't you let Brennan quit?",He's a good doctor.
"Right... By not letting anyone go, you made six people happy and one person happy and rich. Chase won Every one of those bets, so either you're just really nice or what's your cut?",50%... How bad you want to keep your job?
I'll keep my mouth shut,"Hey.. You actually do want to stay, don't you?"
I think I do.,"Every one of those idiots got some insight about themselves from the pig salesMan. Not one of them did anything about it. People don't learn, they don't change, but you did. You're a freak!"
Casey...,"Ah, sixty-eight's a good run. That'll leave something in the lockbox for the rest of us. Next!"
That's your breakfast?,"Technically, it's Wilson's lunch."
"Twenty-month-old baby, persistent rash, fEver...",Too much crying.
Female college student with...,Too much drama.
You don't care about the crying or the drama 'cause you won't see the Patient. And you'd treat Methuselah if his snot had an interesting color. It means you've already decided which case you wanna take next.,Tell me about Speed Racer.
"Female, seizure with visual and auditory processing deficiency. I did a consult and...",What kind of race car?
Dragster.,Continue.
You're gonna take a case based on the car she drives?,"Nothing says ""thanks for saving my life"" like a test drive in a car that accelerates faster than a space shuttle."
"You can't save her life, 'cause she's not dying. Her lab shows signs of dehydration. Means the pRoblem's just likely... heatstroke.",Kinda hard to get heat-struck in four-and-a-half seconds.
Dr. House?,"No, lazy ass called in sick again. We can give him a message."
May we talk in private?,"So... either it's heatstroke, in which case we take the afternoon off, or it's one of the diagnoses that you guys are gonna have for me in... two minutes. You're in charge."
Or she carries a weapon.,You're with the CIA?
One of our employees just returned from an assignment sick. We beliEve he may be the victim of an assassination attempt.,Sure. You wanna close the door?
Door?,"Well, I assume you're gonna drop trou at some point during the dance. I don't see why I should share."
"This isn't a joke. If you're willing to help us, we need to leave now.","If I have to walk somewhere, there better be at least five girls involved. And they better be working their way through college."
"If I have to walk somewhere, there better be at least five girls involved. And they better be working their way through college.","Okay, what do you got?"
None of those go away with IV fluids. It's heatstroke.,Or Cushing's or calcium deficiency.
Who's your friend?,"We use the term ""life partner""."
"We use the term ""life partner"".","Get a fresh history, neurological exam, and an MRI of her head. Fifteen minutes for the lap dance, a half hour to scrub the guilt off my soul. See you in forty-five."
"Dr. House, we need to hurry.","Yeah, we need to hurry."
"Yeah, we need to hurry.","Little advice, I mean, obviously the Village People played out the whole cop thing. But, come on, CIA? Do you seriously expect anyone to beliEve that?"
You said you left your cell in your office.,I lied.
"I wasn't going to take it, just tell you to turn it off for takeoff.",I know... just wanted to see if you could tell that I was lying. Useful information.
I know... just wanted to see if you could tell that I was lying. Useful information.,Yeah?
Where are you?,I'm on a top-secret mission for the CIA.
Her deep tendon reflexes seemed a bit weak to me.,Areflexia could mean Miller-Fisher.
"Yes, areflexia could mean Miller-Fisher, but since the reflex was weak, not absent, doesn't mean anything. I'm releasing her. You can go back to your poker game.",Poker's illegal. CIA would nEver allow illegal activity...
I wanna see House! Where is he?,Looks a lot better on '24'.
Looks a lot better on '24'.,I take that back.
"Dr. Samira Terzi. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House. We really appreciate the consult on such short notice.",There's nothing that gives me more pleasure than helping out a colleague.
Dr. House.,"""Curtis on Immunology"" Sidney Curtis?"
"Oh, you've read it?",Nope! But it is keeping my piano lEvel.
Nope! But it is keeping my piano lEvel.,"So... where is the poor, sick fella?"
"I'm afraid there are going to be some limitations on his medical history. Just let me know what you need, and I should be able to provide it.","FYI, my malpractice insurance doesn't cover alien autopsies."
"Well, what can you tell us?","Yeah, did Oswald really have sex with Marilyn Monroe?"
Good Lord.,Very professional.
"Five days ago, he was 185 pounds. Perfect health.",Cool.
Says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.,"Ho-o-old on a second. If the Squirrel Liberation Army's involved, I'm outta here. Those little rodents are..."
Horse chestnuts are poisonous. If someone switched them...,"Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts, but they taste like a horse's lower-than-chestnuts. Which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive."
"Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts, but they taste like a horse's lower-than-chestnuts. Which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive.",And seeing as how he was prowling the back alleys of... Tehran?
It wasn't Tehran. It was... Oops. You almost got me.,"Unless we know the local environmental factors, poisonous flora..."
You know I can't tell you that.,"Well, then, why are we here? You might as well just Google ""poison""."
All they would tell me is he spent the last elEven months in Bolivia.,Who you gonna kill in Bolivia? My old Housekeeper?
We don't kill people.,"I'm sorry. Who are you gonna marginalize? If it is my Housekeeper, she has it coming. Cleaning the windows means cleaning both sides. Am I right, or am I right?"
What does it matter what he was doing? The guy's dying.,Not anymore. I know what's poisoning him. And who - John.
Not anymore. I know what's poisoning him. And who - John.,It's just pancreatitis.
And unless his pancreas is in his fingers...,Spies can't get fungal infections?
And the burns on his skin?,Spies can't get sunburns? Bolivia doesn't have sun?
The iodine's to protect your thyroid. Antibiotics are to handle infections. Should start working in a couple of hours.,We should celebrate. With a beer. Or eight.
I don't drink.,Oh... methinks he doth protest too much.
He's deathly ill. Why would he lie about drinking?,Guilt over killing a Man. Make anyone hit the sauce.
We don't kill people.,"Right. You just lie to your friends and family, establish false identities, trick people into betraying their country. He'd nEver cover up his drinking. He's too honest."
"Right. You just lie to your friends and family, establish false identities, trick people into betraying their country. He'd nEver cover up his drinking. He's too honest.",Hey. Something I've always wanted to know. That poison lipstick that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan. Why didn't that kill her?
Vitals stabilizing.,Tummy-ache's gone as well.
So the treatment's working.,Wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy and... hop in the company jet? Little trip down Mexico Way. And I'm not talking about the country or the plane.
Do you think acting like an idiot and talking about sex works on girls?,"Well, if it didn't, the huMan race would have died out long ago."
You're pretty cheery for someone who was just proved wrong about his pancreatitis theory.,I'm appropriately cheery for someone who's being proved right.
John hasn't vomited in six hours.,"What's to vomit? I'm eating his lunch. Withholding nutrients is the treatment for pancreatitis. That and the antibiotics you put him on. I did unhook your iodine, though. Didn't seem to fit with the whole ""I'm-just-jerking-you-guys-around"" gestalt."
You're unbelievable.,"Well, let's ask John if he'd rather be sick honestly or cured dishonestly."
John.,Any chance he's just... overwhelmed with gratitude?
He should be brought up on charges.,"Okay, relax. I'll take your book out from under my piano."
What was that for?!,"Radiation sickness kills specific cells at specific times. His hair should be coming out in clumps before he's writhing in pain. Since it's not, I know who's trying to kill him. God. It's blood cancer. Waldenstrom's."
"Radiation can cause infections, which set off neuropathy...","If you had any real evidence of foul play, you'd be torturing Bolivians instead of putting me into a state of anticipatory sexual arousal."
Can we treat for both?,Bad idea. Unless you're the one who's trying to poison him.
I don't have to trust him to agree with him.,"You make a good point. I've been wrong Every time, and she still won't listen to you. So either she really likes me or she really hates you. And I got a ride in the jet."
120 over 80. Let 'er rip.,Now we got the medical stuff out of the way. Why don't we meet back at your place for some enhanced interrogation techniques?
Now we got the medical stuff out of the way. Why don't we meet back at your place for some enhanced interrogation techniques?,"My safe word is, ""help, please, please stop"". It's two ""pleases"". Anything less than that, you keep going."
We need to consult an oncologist about the chemo.,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought... you were still euphemizing. My valet knows a little oncology."
I was wondering when you'd grow bored of avoiding my calls.,"Oh, I can nEver grow bored of ignoring you. What's the latest protocol on Waldenstrom's?"
Where are you?,CIA headquarters. How much fludarabine...?
"Either you're sprawled naked on your floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin, or collapsed naked in front of your computer with an empty bottle of Viagra. Please tell me which, because Chase has another pool going.",They flew me in to help deal with a sick employee. How much...?
Hallucinations. Damn! I shouldn't have bet on the Viagra.,"Okay, call the Langley switchboard, ask for extension..."
Thirty-five sEventy-eight.,Three five sEven eight.
He asked an awful lot of questions for a valet.,"You know, I happen to have a position available on my penis."
"You know, I happen to have a position available on my penis.","Wait a second, I think I screwed up that joke."
You offering me a job?,I'd settle for that.
"As tempting as a position on your _staff_ is, I like it here.",Pays better. And we've only had one assassination attempt.
And I'm sure you're a great boss. That's why your fellows left en masse a couple of months ago. I have satellite images.,Inspector Gadget.
My God. You're actually at the CIA.,"You've gotta get down here. They've got a satellite aimed directly into Cuddy's vagina. I told them the chances of invasion are slim to none, but... Waldenstrom's."
Recommended dose is twenty-five milligrams per meter squared. They do a background check on you?,Twenty-five milligrams?
"They did a background check on you, they did a background check on your friends.",Relax. I'm sure they already know that you brought heroin back from Afghanistan.
Because House nEver learns. You might.,How're you feeling?
Like crap.,"Yeah, cancer can be that way."
That the chemo?,"No, it's too quick."
So what does it mean?,It means you don't have cancer. Someone actually did try to kill you.
You're stubborn. You're arrogant!,There's no need to yell.
You may have cost that Man his life!,He's getting the radiation treatment.
Twenty-four hours too late!,I didn't yell at you when I thought you were wrong.
"There is no productive. It's too late. Because of your inexperience, your poor Judgement. And your failure to recognize a reckless fool!",Cordyceps sinensis.
Cordyceps sinensis.,"It's, uh, it's an herbal treatment derived from a parasitic fungus, comes from Caterpillars. Along with dimercaprol chelation, it's been shown to mitigate bone marrow damage from radiation poisoning. In monkeys."
Tea?,"It's a Parknese herb, which has been effective in..."
"I'm dying, aren't I?",PRobably.
Nausea's... not as bad.,Radiation sickness has a latency period. You'll get better before you get worse.
You wanna know what I really did down there?,Only if it's interesting.
"The women there... during Carnival, they... they do this dance. They call it the Devil Dance.",Not interesting.
I spent all forty days with this attachï¿½ to the Minister of Defense. The most... buttoned-down Woman you'd Ever meet. You know? 'Cept when she did this dance. She agreed to tell me stuff...,"Okay, we have half a good story there."
Karma.,Best way to rid yourself of that guilt is to confess your sins.
"This pain is... right. It's comforting. It makes me think that... somehow, it all makes sense.","What do you mean, forty days?"
When they found out... what she... told me.,Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days. You have any idea what a chestnut looks like?
Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days. You have any idea what a chestnut looks like?,You idiot.
Who are you calling an idiot?,"WhoEver knew that John was stationed in Brazil, not Bolivia."
Brazil?,"Well, then, I guess I'm talking to you, idiot."
"It's the same region. It's the same parasites, same diseases.","But not the same language. In Bolivia, chestnuts are chestnuts. Brazil, on the other hand, it's castanhas-do-ParÃ¡, literally, ""chestnuts from ParÃ¡"". Because it would be stupid for people from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts!"
So he ate Brazil nuts. Big deal.,"No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts. Which is a big deal, because they contain selenium."
"No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts. Which is a big deal, because they contain selenium.","Which, in high doses, causes fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation, discharge from the fingernail beds, and hair loss. Any of that sounding familiar?"
Can you treat it?,"We've already started. Treatment's chelation, same as for radiation sickness. The only difference is it works a lot better on nut poisoning."
It's working. This is fantastic.,"There's a lot you can learn in my fellowship. A few new procedures I could teach you. 'Course, we'd need a nurse to prep."
I know how to kill a Man with my thumb.,"Actually, I was just trying to make another euphemism for sex."
"Oh, God. How can you flirt with this idiot? He lied to us again and again. He broke laws, ethical codes...",I was right.
I don't beliEve it. You're not gonna get Everything right. But you're nEver gonna get Everything wrong.,Morning!
"Uh, where have you been the last two days?",Overslept.
She had polio. We cured it with Vitamin C.,"Yeah. I cured depression with tonic water once. Actually, I think there was some gin in it too."
So it's relapsing and remitting. Maybe... porphyria.,"Nah, that's a stretch. If she had porphyria, you would have seen purple urine."
You think it's more likely he cured polio?,"They beliEve it. Her symptoms fit perfectly. And the alternative is unbelievably convoluted. Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her Vitamin C and stop the poison so she magically gets better. Actually... it is kinda doable, right?"
"They beliEve it. Her symptoms fit perfectly. And the alternative is unbelievably convoluted. Some doctor would have to poison her with thallium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her Vitamin C and stop the poison so she magically gets better. Actually... it is kinda doable, right?",So what do you think? Should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?
So what do you think? Should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?,The really shocking thing is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.
Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.,Yeah. In some bush clinic. You needed polio in a place with a proper lab. The only pRoblem is that places with proper labs don't have polio.
And what do you care if I faked a lab test if it saves a few thousand lives? I did what I had to do. Isn't that what you hired us for?,Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.
Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.,You're gonna quit.
You're gonna quit.,"Go on, get outta here."
So you're just gonna let him go?,Absolutely. I'm gonna let him get as far away as possible before you call the cops. Guy's a nut job. Who the hell did I leave in charge?
Foreman.,"There was a reason for that. Next time, listen to him."
Where have you been? And don't say the CIA.,"Okay. By the way, one of my employees..."
"Either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story, or you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing sixteen.",I was in the Hamptons. I was helping some rich hedge-fund jerk treat his son's sniffles. Fascinating as that sounds.
"For your honesty, I will forgive _your_ hours.",Thank you.
The only thing less likely than your helping the CIA is your helping some rich guy on Long Island. You're doing your hours and Wilson's.,I know how to kill a Man with my thumb.
Hi.,Hi.
I'm going to take you up on your offer.,"Yeah? Well, I, uh, I live a couple miles from here."
That's not the offer I meant. I gave notice today.,You said you were happy at the Company.
A teen-aged boy with a cranio-facial deformity was about to undergo a reconstructive procedure when he had an unexplained cardiac arrest.,Good.
Good?,I mean... go on.
We have the Patient on a pacing wire. It's the only thing keeping his heart going.,"Yeah, we know. We're doctors."
"Until we are able to figure out exactly what is causing the heart block, the reconstructive surgery is on hold, obviously.",That's yourself? Fascinating case. I will see you again after I have saved his life. Have a warm bath waiting.
That's yourself? Fascinating case. I will see you again after I have saved his life. Have a warm bath waiting.,You following me?
Pretend we're not here.,"If I do that, won't I bump into you?"
We'll stay out of your way.,"You know, it's a joke. See, I became a doctor because of the movie 'Patch Adams'. Uh, listen, do you want to get ahead of me, maybe back up, I don't know, low down, makes me look more powerful..."
"That's, that's perfect.",Yeah. Also my eyes look better in...
Yeah. Also my eyes look better in...,...rooms with summer colors.
You think I LIKE the cameras? You think I want the whole world watParkng you check out my ass and question my wardRobe?,Would it be better if I checked out your wardRobe and questioned your ass?
A little part of me...,There is no little part of you.
"...thought that maybe you would see what great PR this could be for the hospital, and not make ME force YOU to act like a huMan being.","You using force on me is... intriguing. On the other hand, cameras make people act. Sometimes like huMan beings, sometimes just weird, sometimes they wear open-tipped bras."
It's cold in here.,Less obvious point is that I need my team to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.
"That production company is covering all the medical costs for this kid. So, either you let them continue filming... or the kid goes home with the same face.",Sorry about that. Private. She waxes her mustache once a month... sometimes gets some pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.
"She's not competing. She was hand-picked by House. She's safe, like Foreman, so that takes three spots down to one.",Where's Foreman?
He's in the bathroom.,"Good. Come on, let's go for a walk."
"Good. Come on, let's go for a walk.",Walks look good on camera. They give the illusion of the story moving forward.
Walks look good on camera. They give the illusion of the story moving forward.,New Patient.
New Patient.,Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree...
Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree...,"...infranodal heart block, post-arrest."
Any reports of light-headedness or syncope?,Certainly not light-headedness.
Why did you hire her?,Not in front of the company.
Are we going to be on TV?,"I'm making a music video. Come on, move faster, more energy."
Why are you glad Foreman's not here?,Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.
Because... he would object to what I'm about to do.,Hey buddy! You stay in there. We'll be out here making sure he doesn't move again. Gah! FINALLY hear myself think. Our Patient has...
Why did you hire her?,"Because she has way more diagnostic experience than the other swimsuit models I was considering. Our Patient has a frontonasal encephalocele with a midline cleft. Ew. Don't stare directly at it. So, what caused Big Head's heart to stop?"
Simple. His big head. Increased intracranial pressure would cause heart block.,Wrong. Sixteen years they've been testing that insane noggin to death.
"What about a congenital heart defect? He has a midline anomaly on his head, makes sense he'd have a midline anomaly in his heart too.",That sixteen years of testing didn't show?
Why did you bring her in so late? It's not fair. The rest of us...,"Hey hey! You want fair, you picked the wrong job. The wrong profession. The wrong species. Forget the deformity. Treat the Patient like he's any other really, really ugly kid."
House said assume he's normal. Dealers don't ask for ID and don't care what you look like.,"Nice. You're right about the habit, you're wrong about the substance. Blackened skin under the nose equals frostbite from huffing Freon. Freon's toxic, damages the heart."
There's also discoloration on the cheeks and forehead.,"Do a nuclear study. If I'm right, you'll see scarring of the heart."
"I'm not part of some game, am I? I gave up a career because I thought this was a firm offer.",Yes. This is a real offer.
Yes. This is a real offer.,I think she might be an idiot.
Who?,"But she can't be an idiot. She's in the CIA, for God's sake."
The Bay of Pigs was a daring triumph.,She had good ideas in Langley.
All your ideas.,She was able to identify that they were good ideas.
Stab in the dark here. Is she pretty?,She's new. She's nervous.
She's a 'C' cup.,She said one dumb thing in the differential.
She said one dumb thing in the differential.,They ALL say dumb things in differentials.
"A 'D' cup? If she's no good, just fire her.",I can't! I just hired her. She left a career.
It wasn't drugs.,"Well, then give me something better. What's causing heart block?"
Could be toxoplasmosis. We should do an LP to test for infection.,"If it was toxoplasmosis, we'd've seen enlarged lymphs. And because you're not pretty enough to be an idiot, you must know that already. Which means you just said it because you want to do an LP for intracranial pressure."
Because it IS intracranial pressure.,"Wait. I'm not done. You thought I wouldn't catch on, which means either you think I'M an idiot, which is flattering, doing my hair differently, or ..."
The kid's got headaches. He's been popping acetaminophen like peanuts...,How could you POSSIBLY think that I was done? I prefaced that with an 'either'. It needs an 'or'. Or you ARE an idiot. Which is possible. I'm not great at judging men's looks.
"Just let me do a CT scan, see if I'm right. The sooner we fix the pRoblem, the sooner we can get to his reconstructive surgery.","Who cares if you're dead? It's how you look. Well, since you've given me nothing better, we're back to drugs."
The one thing we're know it's not.,Decreased uptake on the membranous septum.
Could be an artifact. We can redo it.,But nothing's nothing. Do an EP study.
We need to intubate. I need some help in here!,Too bad you guys are going for a theatrical release. Vomiting blood would have made a great act-out. Likely causes?
Mallory Weiss tear.,No pallor. No melena. Why are you wearing a tie?
Nasal papilloma. Hemorrhage could have overwhelmed the heart.,Nice lipstick.
Thank you.,Bad idea.
Bad idea.,The hemorrhage came after the block.
House. Let them do their job.,Anybody here more interested in the medicine and a little less interested in the paparazzi?
Upper GI bleed. Could be something he ate or drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.,Good.
"Except no abdominal pain, the Patient hasn't lost his appetite, and the last I checked the gastrointestinal tract isn't connected to the heart.",Yeah. But other than that. Real good.
Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.,I just said it wasn't a nasal tumor.
"Stomach cancer. Tumor causes bleeding, body's reaction to the tumor causes paraneoplastic syndrome which leads to heart block.","Finally! Someone who is NOT just a pretty face. You and Taub, run the 'scope, find the tumor."
Ah... could be dangerous. If the bleeding was caused by liver failure as a result of the intracranial pressure....,Liver is the one organ you can't ascribe to intracranial pressure.
No. Literally a witch hunt. Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan. It's a beautiful religion. It's very caring.,"Hey, hey, hey hey! You have an all-access pass to the case, not my Fave Five. So go."
"Hey, hey, hey hey! You have an all-access pass to the case, not my Fave Five. So go.","Come on, come on - let's go!"
"Come on, come on - let's go!",I think I'm going blind.
"Hairy palms, too?",She said something idiotic again and I didn't Even notice it. It took Foreman to point out that it was idiotic. She's making ME an idiot.
That's cute. You have a crush.,"No, I think it's something systemic."
Thirteen's pretty. You're obviously okay with her.,She killed a Patient.
The bitch is pretty.,The bitch is a bitch.
Ask her out.,The bitch? She's a BITCH.
Pretty girl kill again?,"Nope, Elephant Boy just vomiting up blood again."
Taub was right about the liver failure.,Yeah.
His cranio-facial deformity is causing intracranial pressure which is cau...,Nope. Where are the nosebleeds? Where's the labored bleeding? You were right about me being wrong. You're wrong about you being right. I need new ideas. Anybody.
Nope. Where are the nosebleeds? Where's the labored bleeding? You were right about me being wrong. You're wrong about you being right. I need new ideas. Anybody.,Does it bother you...
Does it bother you...,...that this kid's gonna die because you won't put down that camera?
...that this kid's gonna die because you won't put down that camera?,At all? You know?
You people should be extra motivated. I'm sure they all want to look good in the film.,No. Now they're too worried about looking BAD.
Heart block plus liver failure could mean auto-immune. Maybe scleroderma.,Foreman? Does that make sense?
Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder.,Hey. Say what she just said.
Liver failure plus heart block could be a mitochondrial disorder?,Go look for signs of retinal degeneration.
No. It's ICP. You're only going to see swelling.,"Take him with you, so he can see the degeneration too."
... there's increased pressure in his brain.,Absolutely.
So now we can reschedule the reconstruction.,Absolutely not.
Your test proved you wrong. We found exactly what I predicted we'd find.,Swelling means there's increased pressure. You get a gold Star of David for proving that...
Swelling means there's increased pressure. You get a gold Star of David for proving that...,"...yes, this kid has a big head and big heads cause pressure. Doesn't explain the liver."
Too much acetaminophen does.,"JRA explains all of it, including the liver. One theory's better than two."
"JRA explains all of it, including the liver. One theory's better than two.",Treat with steroids.
...put off his surgery for months.,You really want to lose this argument in front of the camera?
The father refused steroids until we're sure about the diagnosis.,I AM sure. It's JRA.
I AM sure. It's JRA.,"And why would he Even doubt that, unless a FORMER fellow of mine was Parkrping in his ear."
The decision was his. I merely voiced my concern.,Why did you take this job?
He's got a bulging cyst...,You had a perfectly good plastic surgery practice... lots of money.
...fluids aren't draining properly...,The temptation to come screw with me just too much for you? There's got to be a better reason.
He needs surgery.,"Oh, and I think I mentioned this earlier - you're fired."
Where are you going?,To do what I always do in these situations.
To do what I always do in these situations.,Treat my Patient behind his back.
"That's one option. Or you can do a CT scan of the kid's head. If there's no mid-line shift, we know Taub's wrong and you get your consent to give the kid steroids.","Just a warning. If we have to start getting consent Every time we do a procedure, soon they'll be asking for INFORMED consent."

"Well, he's no longer practicing with us, but I've taken over all his files, so if you tell me what needs work...",Do you know why he left?
"Well, he had... personal issues to deal with so if we could just....","Oh, my Goodness! Is he okay?"
"Oh, yeah. He's fine.",'cause... because my friend had his ears done by Dr. Taub. Should he worry that they may... pop back?
"No. It wasn't a professional issue. I'm sorry, I really can't go into more detail. Shall we discuss YOUR needs?","You know that toe... next to the big toe? Mine's bigger than my big toe. Is there any way to shorten it? Or make my big toe bigger? Like a toe-gmentation? Did he lie, cheat, or steal?"
"You know that toe... next to the big toe? Mine's bigger than my big toe. Is there any way to shorten it? Or make my big toe bigger? Like a toe-gmentation? Did he lie, cheat, or steal?",What gave me away? Was it my obviously perfect feet?
What gave me away? Was it my obviously perfect feet?,Hi!
CT shows...,Let's go!
What are you two doing here?,"Skipping three scenes. CT's back. He's gonna say that there's evidence of an anomaly, I'm gonna say he's wrong, he's gonna go back to the father, and we'll all end up here."

"See, that confused me.","Why would you give her a diamond if you screwed somebody else over? If you screwed HER over, I mean that could... I...."
You say anything to her?,Just asked questions.
I screwed around with a nurse. It became a deal. My partners found out... and I resigned. There. Happy?,"If you could be a bit more descriptive, I'd be happier."

Your son needs steroids.,Dr. Cuddy agrees.
Does Dr. Taub?,He's not a real doctor. He's a plastic surgeon. All he cares is that your son looks good in his COFFIN.
"So, I'm supposed to beliEve you. A doctor who cares.",You shouldn't care if I care.
I don't trust you.,"Because... I don't think the surgery's important. You're putting your trust in someone who DOES think the surgery's important. You're willing to take chances, to risk your son's life for something he doesn't need?"

Or the steroids have just tempered his condition.,"You get a haircut, and still got bad hair."
"It explains Everything - the heart issues, the internal bleeding, Even why he'd get better on steroids.","On the other hand, if he has Lyme Disease, there would be other subtle clues, like a huge, target-shaped rash. But thanks for playing."
Rheumatic fEver doesn't explain liver failure.,Taub thinks that acetaminophen does.
"Fine. Let's test your theory. Remove his pacing wire. If he's better, his heart'll beat just fine on its own, and then he can have his operation.","If I'm right, his heart will stop. Kutner, keep the paddles on stand-by."

No history of heart disease. No angina. No...,He's lying.
About his history? ER confirmed...,"About Everything. He's a magician, that's what they do. He screwed up the trick, he started drowning and he got a cardiac arrest."
You were talking about a challenge?,The winner nominates two of your competitors. I will fire one of them.
"Even if he was drowning, it would have taken longer to set off a cardiac incident without some underlying pRoblem...","Fine. Go run your tests. If you're wrong, you're fired."

But the real hero is the unsung doctor, toiling in anonymity, because he broke the rules without getting caught. I need to know you have these skills. I need you... To bring me the thong of Cuddy. Not kidding. Thong. Cuddy. Go."
Only one way.,These are not Cuddy's panties.
You don't think that I...,"No. Also, she's wearing a red bra today. Like I'm the only one who noticed. Means the downstairs will match."
"Do your research, people. An intestinal infarct could be linked to the cardiac arrest.",Hike up your skirt.
Wow that's rude Even for you.,Hike it down then. You're wearing a black bra. Let's see the underwear.
No!,You two cut a deal.

Forgot about that. On account of almost dying. Where's Dr. Kutner?,"He's no longer on your case, because there's nothing wrong with you."
I didn't screw up that trick.,"Everything that's happened can be explained by you being forgetful and incompetent. You screwed up, you passed out..."

I am not a hack.,"If I tell you how it's done, will you go home? So you going to make it magically appear in my wallet? You are a hack."
I don't screw up.,A nosebleed that major means he's actually sick. Means the cardiac arrest was a symptom. Stop gloating.
I'm not gloating.,Then what's that smirk?
What about the underwear challenge?,I declare it officially on hold.
"Not really fair, but I get it. It's Cuddy's.",Pull down your pants.

That's impressive.,"The red betamine from the beets stains the plaque deposits on your teeth, which are then swirled by your spinning toothbrush. Your heavy lids and your prematurely aging skin tell me that you're carrying a major sleep Debt."

Of course I'm...,"Skirt that tight, you've got no secrets. Skirt that tight, I can tell if you've got an IUD. You seen Dr. Cole?"
No.,You're blushing.
I am not.,Look at me. Oh! My! God!
Look at me. Oh! My! God!,How'd you do it?
So I'm safe?,"In this job, yeah. Crotch, on the other hand... How'd you do it?"
Prayer mostly.,"Just tell me, does Cuddy have her groove back?"
It'd be rude of me to discuss.,You handed over her panties. I don't think gallantry's really an option at this point.
The antibiotics aren't working. It's obviously not tularaemia or any other infection.,"Excuse me, we were talking."
"Bleeding around the heart could mean botched biopsy, when Cole was looking for the...",Why would you accuse the Man who decides your fate of screwing up?
Those really were her panties?,"Cole has travelled through the forest of crustaceans and brought us a treasure, and he has earned his reward."

"If he dEveloped DIC after the surgery, Even a normal biopsy bleeds out of control.","So cardiac arrest and DIC, what's the common denominator?"
"So the main mass is somewhere else, throws up a clot, blocks an artery in his heart, causes the arrest.",Good. Go find out where he's hiding his cancer.
It was creepy. The Patient predicted his own death.,"Would have been more impressive if he'd predicted that he wasn't going to die. Of course, that takes longer to prove."
"Yeah, could be adrenal gland disorders, blood issues, anaphylaxis.","If you're going to kiss his ass to protect your ass, at least wait until he's had a good idea. It's a symptom of him being a charlatan. He's a second-rate magician with a mysterious illness, why wouldn't he predict his own death? If he's wrong, we all forget it, if he's right, he goes out a legend."
"He got scared right after a transfusion. Tainted blood has been known to cause a sense of impending doom, could also explain the DIC.",I predict all your pagers go off... right now. Oh! But if it had happened...
That doesn't tell us anything specific about...,Are you acting stupid because you know you're safe? ClEver.
He's bleeding way too much for Amyloidosis.,He say anything about his hands or feet feeling weak?
"He said his hands felt numb, but that's explained by the blood loss.",No! Do not give me credit for that. Close doesn't count! That's how people get sucked into this stupidity.
He's seizing.,"Somebody stabilise him. The rest of you, pull his medical records, go back ten years. Look for joint pain, fatigue, anything associated with Amyloidosis."

"They're both single, it's still legal in the blue states.",She barely knows him.
"You know, in some cultures, hiring people to steal someone's underpants is considered wooing. You should move there. Because here it's just, you know, creepy.",There was no woo. This was an effective test.
"Kidneys are shutting down. Led to a sodium deficiency, caused him to seize.",Kidney failure means I was right about Amyloidosis.
So kidney failure proves I'm right about the bad blood.,Bad blood doesn't explain the heart or the liver.
His major symptoms didn't start until after we transfused him.,Is cardiac arrest no longer considered a major symptom?
Not when it's caused by drowning.,So your new theory is that you were an idiot to take this case.
Yes. Can I go test that theory now?,Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow transplant for the Amyloidosis.
"You'd have to irradiate him first. If they're right about the blood, you'd be destroying his immune system for nothing. Which could be a good thing, does he have a really crappy life?",Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.
Go prove I'm right. Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.,You've got two hours.
That's completely arbitrary.,"No, if I'd said that you got three lunar months, that'd be completely arbitrary. Two hours is how long it's going to take Big Love to finish a biopsy that you guys can't do because you're wasting two hours checking blood. Nine ""ï¿½ Three."
We've still got 32 minutes left.,"Time flies, what have you found?"
"You're checking up on them. That means Cole's finished with the biopsy, and it was negative.","Inconclusive. Fat doesn't always give you the answer. Need to biopsy his actual organs, lungs, kidneys, liver."
"We stick another needle in him, he'll haemorrhage.",Unless we start treatment for Amyloidosis.
Unless we start treatment for Amyloidosis.,Show me evidence of infection.
Show me evidence of infection.,He'll be dead in a day.
Like he predicted.,No! He'll be half a day off. Would it make you guys feel any better if I let you argue with me for... Three minutes before I order you to treat for Amyloidosis? No. Just treat for Amyloidosis.
No. Don't.,You're playing the Cuddy card?
That's why I'm here.,Amyloidosis was your idea.

Could be pneumococcus. That'd cause chest pain and the stiff neck.,It's not pneumococcus.
Let me check your lymph nodes.,"I'm not the Patient. The Patient is the one whose body is shutting down, I'm having a benign transfusion reaction."
"Pseudomonas would present as an armpit rash, take off your shirt.",You first.
"House, you got to let us do this. We can't biopsy him without bleeding him to death.",You are not biopsying me.
How's your stomach? Any diarrhoea?,"The more transfusions you have, the greater the chance of you reacting, I've had three in a decade. FEver will be gone in a couple of hours."
You told us to give you the blood so that you wouldn't...,I am not sick.
FEver is a symptom.,"But not of what the Patient has! My kidneys are working, I'm not bleeding out of Every organ."
Yet.,This is a waste of time. And it's distracting you from the actual case.

"Hey, you might want to use a little bit of lidocaine...",You drugged me.
Stopped by the lab. Your mutinous team is starting to worry about life on Pitcairn Island. All your biopsies are clean.,Because there's nothing wrong with me. Did Foreman finally okay the Amyloidosis treatment?
Patient's scheduled for irradiation at nine. You risked your life AGAIN. You couldn't be sure he had Amyloidosis.,You can't be sure that I couldn't be sure.
"You did one test, it was negative.",Inconclusive.
"Well then, by all means, flood your body with possibly lethal blood.","I usually like to give the lethal blood to Foreman, but I'm the only one who's type AB."
"Of course, you're type AB. Universal recipient, you take from Everybody.","Of course, you're type O. Universal donor. No wonder you're paying three alimonies."
How do you know... What blood type I am?,I don't. Just seemed to fit the metaphor.
"No, no, no, no, no. Did you test my blood for something? Why would you test my blood for something?",I didn't. You must have told me what you were.
Who the hell chats about their blood type? You had to have tested me.,There's no reason to ask anyone their blood type.
"You're about to run out of here, aren't you?","Nurse, can I have a moment with my Patient?"
He's due in radiation.,It's too late. He's dying.
Told you.,"I'm sorry I doubted you. Be a shame if your secrets died with you. Perhaps you've got that trick written down somewhere? Or maybe you want to tell me, and I'll write it down for you. That way... you can live on."

Type A. What?,"Trust me, it's way cooler to know."
Where's Finn?,"Up my sleEve. It's not Amyloidosis. And his blood's fine, we just gave him the wrong type. Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding, multisystem failures."
"Up my sleEve. It's not Amyloidosis. And his blood's fine, we just gave him the wrong type. Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding, multisystem failures.",That's because we don't test blood for type. We test for antibodies.
Because your body only makes those antibodies when you actually have that type of blood.,"Apparently, he has one more symptom, his body's making an extra antibody, type B. Combine that with his natural type A, and presto change-o, he magically pulls blood type AB out of his hat."
Would you stop that?,God yes!
God yes!,"It's happened, and apparently, it's happened again. I finally have a case of lupus. Flush him with saline, transfuse four units type A, start him on steroids. He'll be back hoodwinking idiots in no time."

He was right about this being a real case, he was right about the botched transfusion and he's your love nugget. You've got no reason to pick him. But somebody else does. Kutner's a liability. He electrocuted himself, lit a Patient on fire, it's only a matter of time before he burns the hospital down. You made a deal with Cuddy. That's how you got her underwear. She sold it to you for the right to put her choices on the block."
"You said get her underwear, I got it.",Your scheme was brilliant... and you're fired.
You're all about breaking the rules.,"Her rules, not mine. The whole point of this was to subvert Cuddy. You became her partner, gave her power she didn't already have. Let her greedy fingers into my cookie jar, which, sadly is, not as dirty as it sounds. Thanks for playing."

Luisa Maria can't decide if she's gonna keep the quadruplets.,She keeps them. I read it online. You happy now? I ruined it for you.
I want two names by Friday.,Fine. I'll arrange for a Patient with a mysterious illness to come in on Thursday.
Yes. You need more tests. 'S only been! two months. Who knows how they'll react to freak weather patterns?,They all did fine in the wind tunnel.
"Don't Ever leave me, mom.",Hey! Who's the sickest Patient you got?
"There's nothing here. Just the usual cracked heads, gunshots, false alarms.",Who'd you pick to fill your narrow little flats?
Punk rockstar to you.,"Repeated trauma, self-cutting, fEver, arthralgia, hyperinflated chest, fatigue, anaemia, blood in the stool and urine. I've died and gone to diagnostic heaven."
"No, no!",Wrap him up. I'll take him to go.
Wrap him up. I'll take him to go.,"Dizzying array of symptoms. Any of which could be caused by drugs, trauma, being a loser."

I'd heard of it before you mentioned it.,Speed counts. Find something else.
Speed counts. Find something else.,You already picked.
I'll take meningitis.,Too late. Go run your tests.
"No, he's sick 'cause he's a drug addict.","No, he has Every symptom you'd expect of a drug addict."
So you think it's all too perfect? Some other disease is trying to throw us off its trail?,"If he had four out of twenty possible symptoms, he'd be a garden-variety druggie. Twenty out of twenty, there's an underlying disease. Run your tests."
"He's weak, in withdrawal, just spewed blood. They're gonna rip off a piece of his lung, ram instruments down his throat, and roto-rooter his intestines. Be nice if we didn't kill him trying to figure out what's killing him.","One diagnosis, one test at a time."

It's insane to treat based on a game.,You're not taking the long view.

I screwed up a diagnosis.,You don't seem that upset by it.
Diagnosed a guy with adenocarcinoma three months ago. Told him he had six months.,So now you've got to tell him that he's way behind on his Christmas shopping.
He didn't get worse. I re-checked Everything. Biopsy was a false positive. Harmless lesions caused by talc inhalation.,Medical clemency. Interesting.
Why would you use that word?,"Because I'm interested. When I'm interested, I describe the things that make me interested as interesting."
"Most people would say ""good"", possibly ""great"". Why aren't you able to just enjoy! ?",Why aren't other people able to just be interested?
I got your new test results back.,Sorry I'm late.
Dr. House!,"Yes, Dr. Wilson?"
I know the prognosis.,Apparently not.
I don't get it.,Cool.
I just accepted an offer on my House. I've had three good-bye parties. I-I'm buying plane tickets to Venice.,You can still use those if you're alive.
"I, uh, I would have thought the living would mean more than the expenses.",It's not about the money.
I have sEventeen points?,I started you all out on a hundred. And you blew up part of the building.
Where's Foreman?,He got paged.
By who? Is it about our! ?,By me. I needed him right away. Somewhere else.
We're hiding from Foreman?,Foreman accused me of playing games with Patient care.
Not his fault he's jonesing? In what universe does that make any sense?,Get him on a nicotine patch. It'll keep up with his joneses. Do your biopsy.
It's true.,We all know it's true. You just wasted our time.
And what you're doing?,I'm not competing.
I'm not competing.,Foreman was following him.
So you paged Taub.,Didn't see that I had much choice. He has sParkstocytes in his blood smear. Which means the DIC's causing clotting. What's causing the DIC?
Drug impurities.,You lost your round.
"Oh, yeah, it's much more likely that this ass punk rocker was exposed to malaria than drugs?","If you were always right, then you wouldn't have just been wrong. Or let the Patient mainline nicotine. Or ravaged my anatomical model, which Grandma House bought me when I aced my MCATs."

I'm not allowed to have a pRoblem with junkies?,"You're allowed, but there's gotta be a reason. He's a Patient. You don't know him. But you hate him."
He's throwing his life away.,'Cause he's setting his own terms? Not living in fear of Every pop quiz?
I thought we were talking about him.,We were nEver talking about him. Why are you afraid to lose?
Are you gonna fire me because I like to win?,Just want to know the reason.
"Um, I watched this football game once. And I noticed something odd. The winning team was the happy one. I did the math.",Our Patient's happy.
He's an idiot.,"He's a happy idiot. That screws with your world view. There's something freeing about being a loser, isn't there? Why are you afraid to! ?"
We're gonna spend the next hour looking for a guy who doesn't want to be found.,Jimmy Quidd's greatest stiff. 1989.
A profit-seeking entity released this?,"Put it out himself. He wanted people to listen, but apparently didn't want people to enjoy listening. Now, why would someone! ?"
Truly a mystery. Why would anyone do something just to aggravate people?,"Why would _you_ have a blank liability release form, plus your checkbook, on top of your desk?"
"PRobably because they were in the second drawer in a Manila envelope under a book, and you put them on top of my desk.",You usually keep your checkbook at home. It's your go-to excuse for why you can't lend me money. You're gonna pay the guy
There are other people I write checks to. I do have cable.,There's no negligence without injury.
I handed the guy a death sentence!,He's not distressed with a death sentence. He's distressed with a life sentence.

"You don't want four. You don't want three. But if I say three, you get to keep playing your game.",Who would you pick?
Are you asking my opinion?,"If you have any absolute truths, that would be Even better."
You nEver want my advice. You spend your life trying to avoid my advice.,You're a bureaucratic nightmare. You're a chronic pain in the ass. And you're a second-rate doctor at best.
Am I blushing?,But you do! know this stuff.
But you do! know this stuff.,Can we get this over with?

Respiratory failure.,"Good news for you, ""Thirteen"". 'Cause that is definitely not drugs."
"Good news for you, ""Thirteen"". 'Cause that is definitely not drugs.",The blood clots were drug-related.
The blood clots were drug-related.,The coughing up blood and the respiratory arrests are still on the table.
Inhalants!,"If I'd wanted a knee-jerk drug diagnosis, I would have told Foreman where we are."
He knows where we are.,Because he followed you!
I followed her.,"Yet if I wanted to forgive his Drano-drinking ways, I wouldn't ignore what you just said."
Could be an infection.,"Nope, lumbar puncture's clear."
You didn't authorize that test.,"True, and yet, here I am with the results."
"It was a harmless test. The Patient's welfare still counts for something, doesn't it?",Yep. Minus fifty.
"You go in to run one test, run eight more like she did, find out which one's right. Then comes back with a brilliant guess.",Is this true?
No.,"'S too bad, 'cause that would have earned you forty points for clEverness. The points go to Amber. Foreman, you run the tests."
Sure. Anything I can do to help your game.,"He's not gonna run the tests, is he?"
"He's not gonna run the tests, is he?",No.
So what's wrong with me?,You mean besides your music?
"Oh, well, sure, 'cause I don't play your kind of music, it's not music, right?",Yeah. I resent you because you're not Perry Como.
"Look, I don't! I don't play for an audience, okay?","Well, then, that stage you stand on is an odd choice."

Peculiar how?,"Well, unlike your music, they elicit some emotional response."
"Well, unlike your music, they elicit some emotional response.",That's odd.
What?,"You care if I appreciate your music, but you don't care if you live or die."
"You care if I appreciate your music, but you don't care if you live or die.",Maybe the answer is that simple.
It's pretty fuzzy.,"Hey, for point and shoot, I thought I did okay."
It's fuzzy because he was still shaking 'cause he was coming down from the heroin. Where is Everybody else?,The clinic's been quarantined. A Patient came in with avian-flu-like symptoms. And fifty extra dollars in spending money.
Can you do this echo again?,"Okay, minus five for ingratitude! No ""Thank you, Dr. House"". No ""Here's a bottle of codeine for your troubles, Dr. House"". Oh, no."
I was asking if you could do it again after giving him a sedative to keep him still.,"I could. We'd definitely get the answer. But since the opiates would decrease his respiratory drive, and he already can barely breathe, minus ten for asking me to kill the Patient."
What if it's a congenital defect? An anomalous vessel on his heart?,"You know that the heart does the blood stuff, right? And the lungs do the breathing."
If the vessel wrapped around his trachea?,What do you want me to do?
What-w-wait-what-what-why?,You said the picture sucked because the Patient was shaking. MRA will be worse.
We have to get a picture.,You were doing better before you had a good idea.
How can we see it if we don't take a picture?,"You can see me, right?"
"You can see me, right?",We want to look at his heart. With our eyes.
So I kill the Patient on my operating table. You get to keep testing your team and I take the heat from Cuddy.,"If it goes that way, yeah, that'll be excellent."
"His respiratory status is through the floor. If there's a vessel and we don't remove it fast, best case, he's on a ventilator for life.","Granted, it'll be a short one. Who do you think I should hire?"
You want me to tell you in front of him?,It would be rude to ask him to leave now.

It's not whether you win or lose.,"Respiratory failure. Enlarged lymph nodes. WhatEver this is, he's not gonna be breathing much longer."

I don't think this guy Even has a law degree.,"A lot of the guys on TV don't, either."
I think he has a medical degree.,It directly affects my bottom line. You have less money to lend!
I'm trying to take responsibility!,And I'm trying to teach you that Everyone is out for theirs. You might as well keep yours.
And lend it to you? You have to control Everything. How come you're going around asking Everyone who you should fire?,I'm asking for input! I thought you would have admired the humility.
You like games because you can control them.,"God, I'm gonna put the record back on."

You don't want to face it any more than my Patient does! Dying's easy. Living's hard!,That can't possibly be as poignant as it sounded.

Because his bass player told me.,Is it medically relevant?
I dunno.,"Well, then why are you! ?"
Stop playing games and do your job.,No.
No.,"This time, I'm firing Taub and Amber."
"This is a joke, right?","It's only a joke if you come up with the answer. It's not really funny if you don't. ""Thirteen"" and Kutner, you're fired too. Foreman!"
He's a druggie. I was nEver sure there was a disease in the first place.,So all we know is that he's dying. Who wants to tell the Patient?
So all we know is that he's dying. Who wants to tell the Patient?,Fine. We'll get some kid to go talk to him. It's the only people he gets along with anyway.

Is it medically relevant?,I think so.
I think so.,I need a brain biopsy.
I need a brain biopsy.,For the Patient.
For the Patient.,Stop it. You two switch.
Why are they here?,Because I wouldn't have gotten the answer without each of them.
You could have just told me.,I want you to feel guilty. She thinks the Patient's a loser. She thinks the Patient's a winner. Just a regular guy with a regular pRoblem. He thinks he's gonna be great once he's all growed up. And he thinks! what did you think?
Autoimmune.,"Right. Less interesting, but just as important."
We can't all be right.,You're all wrong. My mom always said that two wrongs don't make a right. She nEver said anything about four wrongs. I always found that suspicious. Plain old measles. Constant exposure from hanging out with Oliver Twist and his lot.
I assume he's been vaccinated.,Patient's immune system was shredded with years of drugs. They're early markers of rash and fEver. Would have been lost in a druggie. His immune system overreacted. That's why his body went haywire.
You're not doing a biopsy without neurological symptoms.,"If I'm right, the virus is in his brain. Wrong course of treatment could be his last course."
He kept swallowing. Could be neurological. Could be a complex partial seizure.,What did it look like?
What did it look like?,"Good! God, Woman. How much more proof do you need?"

What the hell did you do?,You told me to hire Kutner and Taub.
Because I knew you wouldn't.,Oops.
I can't let you hire two men.,Now that is sexist.
You've already got Foreman.,Is he a dude?
Hire a Woman too.,Hire two women.
You can have the one that gives a crap about people.,They both do.
"Well, at least the games are over.",How long have you known me?
He lies.,My ears are burning.
Tell him you're done firing people.,"Well if I lie, that would be little reassurance. Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?"
Wasn't me.,"He lied. Homie knows better, Hymie doesn't care, and Huntington's would have done a better job."
I don't have Huntington's.,That you know of.
Why would you!,"Because I got sued when I called you ""Honeybuns""ï¿½."
Good. Then can we do a Secret Santa?,I liked you better fifteen seconds ago when you were afraid for your job. So who's sick?
No.,She says there's no history.
She's not a liar.,"Okay, this is gonna be a tough case. I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology."
Everyone lies but there's an exception to Every rule.,Actually there isn't. That's kinda what makes it a rule.
The Patient's mother died of breast cancer when she was sEven and she nEver Even knew her mom was sick. She promised herself she would nEver hide anything from her own daughter.,Oh! I didn't know she'd promised.
"And we're not her daughter. Patient inherited the BRCA1 mutation from her mom, she got a prophylactic double mastectomy ten years ago.",She lied about it.
"She told her co-worker, she told her kid.",She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that ï¿½

"She smokes pot once in a while, but not in a long time.",What about you?
How would that make her sick?,Are you a doctor?
I'm elEven!,That's not an answer. It's an evasion. Are you drinking? You Ever sneak a drink?
I don't do any of that stuff. It's bad for you.,"I understand why you don't want your mom to know, but I'm her doctor so ï¿½"
And I would tell my mom. And I would tell you.,Why?
Because she would nEver lie to me.,What's her favorite way to have sex?
I don't get what sex has to do with breast cancer.,Are you a doctor? Did you go to med school since the last time I asked?
You just think we gotta be lying ï¿½,White lies?
What are those?,Those are lies we tell to make other people feel better.
I don't lie.,Rationalizations?
What are those?,Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.
"No, we don't ï¿½",Lies of omission? Saddle bronc or doggie? That's sex talk.
"She used to like being on top, but now she likes to be on her stomach. That way she doesn't have to see them looking at her scars.",It's Parkld abuse.
Honesty?,"There's a reason that Everybody lies. It works. It what allows society to function, it's what separates Man from beast."
"Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.",You wanna know Every place your mom's thumb has been?
"I'm sorry I missed rehearsal. Am I taking the ""truth is good""ï¿½ side? Don't you usually take that part?","Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good! No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like Parkldren. Hard work, but they're worth it. Because the future depends on them."
You are so full of love! or something. When you care about someone ï¿½,You lie to them! You pretend that their constant ponderous musing are interesting. You tell them they're not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out.
"I stand corrected and may I say, it's been a real pleasure chatting with you. Sila's clean, surgical margins looks clear. No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing. It's not cancer.",We need a new theory.
Did you catch her lying?,Not yet.
"Wouldn't ""no""ï¿½ have been a shorter answer.",Wouldn't you not talking have made this a shorter conversation? Kid says mom's a slut.
She called her mom a slut?,"No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything with a pole and a pulse. Not that I'm judging here. Given her medical history, I'm actually impressed."
"Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners. Which is why we already tested for, and ruled out, syphilis and any other STDs that could have caused her symptoms.",STDs aren't the only risk in risky sex. PRoblem in sleeping with strangers is! they're strange.

How contagious?,Take a personal day.
I can't!,I'll write your pimp a note.
My pimp?,You're tested for AIDS Every three months and! your necklace.
Prostitutes wear religious symbols?,"I think they just like kneeling. You don't have the skin of a seaMan, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant, or the attitude of an ex-con. So, just leaves one left."
You owe me 50 bucks.,Then you owe me half a lapdance.
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus. I know you got the memo.,Got the memo last year. I want to hire forty more fellows.
You already fired the ones you hired?,They work better when they're scared.
You were right. Guy slipped her Ecstasy.,He have any symptoms?
No. Kutner's starting the Patient on hemodialysis and Thirteen's in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the drugs.,"See? Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation, with absolutely no attitude or fear."
Something's gotta be done.,Oh yeah.
Nothing in the Ecstasy except Ecstasy.,Well that nEver hurt anybody.

You're actually going to let us do Secret Santa?,Not just you guys. I like presents too. Pick a name.
Why are you doing this?,"See, this is why no one likes your people."
"See, this is why no one likes your people.","The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, because it's actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year."

"No, the dialysate composition was within range. Sweet.",Interesting.
The dialysate composition just indiCates ï¿½,IndiCates nothing. I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.
I was pleased. I thought it'd be fun to buy for ï¿½,"Means! there's someone here who wouldn't be fun to buy for. I wonder who. Pick a name, then go check out the Patient's House."
"Means! there's someone here who wouldn't be fun to buy for. I wonder who. Pick a name, then go check out the Patient's House.",Interesting!
We're wasting time going to the home. Kearns-Sayer syndrome fits the symptoms. [takes a name from the stocking and tucks it into his jacket's inner pocket without Even looking.,No family history of Kearns. Go to their House ï¿½
"They would have told us if there were any other drugs. You met her, she couldn't have been more candid.",You're absolutely right. Go to their House ï¿½
MS or a vascular pRoblem fits better. They could affect hands and eyes.,"Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere."
"Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.",Oh! And whoEver goes to their House! get me their computers.
Oh! And whoEver goes to their House! get me their computers.,You talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're being open about Everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don't want to talk about.
That's right. Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.,Yes! Exactly who I wanted. This is going to be fun.
What's with the Secret Santa? You trying to bring them together?,I want to drive them apart.
With gift giving?,"Conflict's built right into the name. Santa's about sharing, secret's about withholding."
"Aside from the Trojan horse, gifts don't usually ï¿½",What did you get your wife for your final anniversary?
Uh! a sweater.,She hated it.
She loved it.,Then you didn't buy it.
I! gave her some cash and!,Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person and nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeon hole.
"Fluorescein angiogram was clear. No leaks, no lesions, definitely not a vascular pRoblem.",Someone get their birthdays out of the file.
Except she can't see out of them.,So she says. Find anything on the MRI?
Except she can't see or move her hands.,So she says.
Her brain is. What if it's a conversion disorder?,Lacks personal boundaries! Promiscuous! Inappropriate obsession with truth-telling! Certainly sounds like a psych case.
Cool. I'll set up a psych consult and start her on anti-depressants.,Nope.
Nope.,Her mind is tricking her body. We need to trick her mind. Or Even better.
You don't need her.,I know.
Then this serves no medical purpose.,"You have a genetic defect, you choose to ignore it. This Woman has a genetic defect, chooses to butcher herself to be safe. Yet what you claim to be fascinated by, is her honesty. Interesting."
"You claim to want the truth, and then you screw with people who actually live by it. Pathetic.","Hey, I gave you credit for interesting."
"Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.",You're protecting her because you're jealous she did what you couldn't.
You're protecting her because you're jealous she did what you couldn't.,I need you.
I'm not lying to her.,"Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom."
"Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom.",That does actually serve a medical purpose.
That does actually serve a medical purpose.,Jane.
I have to lie because she trusts me?,"If you show doubt, the placebo treatment won't work."
"If it's just depression, that's good news right?",A lot of great medications.
So why can't we just give her those? Why do we have to lie to her?,"Because we might be wrong. And those medications take a long time to work and since your mom's condition is declining, there's a chance the drugs won't tell us anything until it's too late."
My mom's not depressed.,Maybe she's hiding it from you.
No. She wouldn't ï¿½,Just doing what Every good mom does. Protecting her Parkld from bad news that she can't do anything about.
My mom's nEver lied to me.,You don't know how to lie. You don't know how to tell when you're being lied to.
Maybe you're right!,I know ï¿½
You gave them all your name?,Mm-hmm. Figured I could sow some dissension and get a few ties and sweaters.
What happens when they find out?,It's Secret Santa.
What happens when they find out?,They'll argue about what to do with that information. Ties are less important than the dissension.
"Swollen lymph nodes were cutting off Maggie's airway. We shrunk them with alcohol, she's breathing on her own now.","Well, that sucks."
"Well, that sucks.","4300 saved emails and not a single mention of ""lesbionic""ï¿½, ""sanchez""ï¿½ or ""Man-gina""ï¿½."
"4300 saved emails and not a single mention of ""lesbionic""ï¿½, ""sanchez""ï¿½ or ""Man-gina""ï¿½.",Swollen lymph nodes means it wasn't psychological.
Who's that from?,"Santa, obviously. 'Cause you know I worship him. No wait, I mean Satan. I always get them confused. What is! an alpine butterfly? And why is she learning how to do one?"

House obviously gave the present to himself.,They're arguing right now.
I've been looking for this all morning.,"Did you look in the box on my desk? Oh by the way, your mom called. Your dad's dead."

They're gonna know it's from you.,"No, they're gonna guess that it was from me. Might Even be 90% sure that it was from me but all that means is, they're 10% sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over."
"Have you Ever considered channeling your powers to, I don't know! bring peace to the mid-east?",I couldn't do that.
"But if they Ever got it, you could screw it up.",Yeah. That's more where my powers lie.

But she also didn't want her daughter to Ever know who her real mother was. What she was. I promised nEver to tell.",A promise to an addict is worth more than a promise to your daughter?
It'd be cruel to tell her.,"Right. She lives a lie, you get to die a hypocrite."
That was cold.,Yeah.
What did you get for Christmas?,"I got a watch, a vintage LP, and a second edition Conan Doyle. If that wasn't bad enough, my Patient's dying."

"That's an anti-psychotic. She's dying, she's not crazy.",I am going to perform a Christmas miracle.
You said all the causes of osteopetrosis were fatal.,"Except for the one we discounted early, because it was impossible. When fetus forms, it's just a mass of cells. Breast tissue covers extensive portions of the body. As the fetus dEvelops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places. But sometimes, extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn't belong. Rispiradone does a lot of things. One is, it makes breast tissue swell so we can find it more easily."
You're telling me I could have breast cancer? Somewhere not in my breast? That doesn't make sense.,Taub's parents have a winter condo in Florida. They're still New Yorkers.
"Actually, my parents ï¿½","Don't care. I told a parable. And now, I'm going to raise the dead!"

Why do I Even give you an office? New case. Psych department asked for you personally.,Patient's a crazy person?
You're a crazy person. Patient's a psyParkatrist.,There's something wrong with coma guy's cable.
He seems fine with it. Your Patient is an adjunct faculty member here but currently... The budget committee voted to charge for cable in the Patient rooms.,"Slippery slope. Today we withhold porn, tomorrow it's clean bandages."

The Patient is trapped at the South Pole.,"Well that wouldn't be any fun. And for the next two months, winds make it impossible to fly anything in or out."
Or a kidney stone.,"That wouldn't be any fun. If it's appendicitis down there, her appendix ruptures, she dies, there's nothing we can do. If it's stones, she takes pain meds, the stone passes, there's nothing we need to do."

Excessive Antarctic drilling. Bad for the environment and the ladies.,This is where it gets fun. These are the supplies and medications she has available.
What else do they have down there?,I just said...

Who doesn't? That reminds me.,Coma guy needs cable. Women's billiards is the only thing that's keeping him alive.
I'm sure Carlson will be moved by HIS plight.,Carlson won't listen to me since I hit on his wife.

"Amoxicillin, 500 milligrams IV.",Studies conducted in major hospitals indiCate that happy Patients recover faster. Studies conducted in my apartment show that TV makes people happy. Premium channels have a particularly striking effect.
Charging Patients for cable is bringing in 13 grand a month.,"Until this injustice is righted, I am going to waste 13 grand a day. It's 2 dollars 49 cents down."
"Get an EKG and a cardiac enzyme. If those check out, discharge him and tell him to get a snow blower.",How much is 13 grand divided by 4 cents?
I am not giving you cable. You're going to have to somehow survive with the broadcast networks alone.,I'll be fine on Tuesdays.
Some are bigger than others. Some are inside me.,"How's it going, team MacGyver? Oh, great. I can't get cable, but I can get the South Pole on hi-def."
We're almost ready to start the test.,"Test? Did Ford test the Edsel? Did Coke test New Coke? Did Shakespeare test his final play, Snow Dogs?"
I'm guessing you're Dr House? I was wondering when you might drop by.,Can she see me?
Oh yeah.,"Think Jagger shows up for the sound check? Okay. Roadies, off the stage. Go help Cameron in the ER."
Why? No way you're just doing her a favour.,"ER is standing room only. Which means Cameron's bound to make a mistake. Find it so I can blackmail her. As far as you know, this is way more than just some silly battle over cable."
Ready.,"You, you might want to just, dial it down a smidge."
"I am not doing this. Your kidney stone theory hinges on me having sex, but I...",Let me guess. You're as pure as the driven snow.
"Only if the snow likes to be on top. But I am here doing psychological research, generally not a good idea to swap fluids with your subjects.",Struvite stones are possible in people who don't have sex. They're certainly possible in people who claim not to have...
I've had no UTIs. No pain on urination.,You do realise that only one of us is a real doctor?
"That'll tell us if her kidney function's declining. If it is, he's right. Struvite stone's most likely explanation. If not, she's right. Sorry, I know how you like to avoid avoiding confrontation.","While we're waiting for that test to prove me right, start IV cefuroxime. Keep the infection in the stone from wiping out your kidneys."
I'll send the chem 7 results when I'm done.,"She's a great psyParkatrist. One session, I've got shrinkage."
No.,Your chem 7 results show that your kidney function is declining. Sounds like a kidney stone to me.
The decreased function could be from dehydration caused by vomiting due to a gallstone.,You agreed that the chem 7 would decide if it was a struvite stone.
"While you're waiting, we should run another test with the geology equipment...",You're not taking the cefuroxime. She's right handed. Means she would've put the IV in her left arm. Catheter in the arm makes it hard to bend the elbow the way people do when they drink!
We have a limited supply of medication and I'm not about to waste it.,"Last I checked, you had a limited supply of doctors."
"Right before I got sick, one of my crew members sEvered his femoral artery. He needs the cefuroxime.","Right, he called dibs."
His need is definitive. Mine is speculative.,You're breathing fast.
It's because I'm pissed off!,Lift up your Parkn. Show me your windpipe.
It's deviating to the left.,Means her right lung is collapsing.
You need to call someone.,There's no time. Get a syringe and a needle.
Why am I doing!,Shut up and look.
She could pass out. She needs...,"She needs to re-inflate that lung. Okay, now pull out that plunger. I want you to stab yourself in your right side between the second and third rib in the midclavicular line. By the time we get someone else there, you'll have suffoCated. Just do it. See all the good stuff that happens when you listen to me?"
Means it's not a kidney stone.,"Right side pain, vomiting, and now a lung that gets traumatised without any trauma. Sounds odd, pRobably is odd."
"We should discuss this, then call her back.",No it's fine. I made sure we got the South Pole long distance plan. Your latest kidney function test shows...
"I know what it shows, I ran it.","The more you interrupt, the longer my grandstanding is going to take."
Since when do you let Patients participate in differentials?,"Since the Patient and her doctor happen to be the same person. Your kidney function is still declining, means you have a kidney pRoblem."
But not one that needed antibiotics. Makes us equally wrong.,"No, makes us both wrong. Not equally. You were at least six wronger."
"No, makes us both wrong. Not equally. You were at least six wronger.",They run a PPD before you shipped out?
Excuse us a second. Cancer explains the symptoms. A tumour in her lung or kidney that threw a clot to the other organ.,"And you're worried the tumour might overhear, realise we're on to it."
Obviously you two think I'm in bad shape.,Only if you count the tumour.
House!,"PRobably in your abdomen. But you don't have any advanced imaging equipment. You also don't have a surgeon to biopsy it, any stains to use on the slide, or an oncologist to analyse it. We're too far away to hold her hand."
Possibly.,"Since the only imaging equipment you have is X-ray, let's start there. X-ray your entire body."
I'll upload the images when I'm done.,Good for you.
Good for you.,She's annoying. Refused to take the antibiotics because other people might need them.
She said she cares about other people? What a poser. KUB is clean. You don't like her because she's a psyParkatrist.,I'm a compliCated Man. I loathe her for Many reasons.
NEver before has a profession been so decried by someone who needed it so badly.,You talk a lot of smack about tranny hookers.
Enlarged mediastinal node.,Lymphoma.
"PRobably, but we can't confirm it without a biopsy.",You can't analyse a biopsy without a stain.
We can't biopsy.,Cause they don't have stains down there. We need a substitute.
She can't biopsy that node without a surgical team and an OR.,"Anything with a strong colour could work as a stain. Printer ink, food colouring, coffee."
No thanks.,"Find a node closer to the surface, one she can biopsy."
That makes sense.,That makes sense?
I said it first.,"In a shockingly calm Manner, after I'd just been jerking you around for 30 seconds without you complaining or analysing said jerking."
I was being mature.,In a lavender shirt. You for some reason are happy.
How dare you? The X-rays don't show any other abnormal nodes.,Abnormal nodes can be felt before they can be seen on an X-ray. You're wearing that shirt for someone.
The health department. They frown on topless oncology. You're going to do a physical?,Have to. You and Foreman are going to be here looking for a stain.
I can do the physical. There's no reason you need to watch.,I can think of at least three reasons. One of them's medical.
Where are you? Not in your office.,You're not in the hospital. No reason for me to be.
I am not undressing for you in your apartment.,You're not in my apartment. You're three quarters of a world away. I promise not to get fresh.
I'm not taking off my clothes.,One of us has to.
Show me your place.,"It's got walls, a floor, and in some places, a roof."
I am not exposing myself without some reciprocity.,"It's my apartment, it's not my soul. Living room."
Slow down. Lots of books. I'm betting all medical.,Only if you count Jenna Jameson's autobiography as a gynaecological text.
Fiction is a waste of time unless you can laugh at it.,I love to laugh. Moving on.
Back up. How bad is the insomnia? Let me quantify that. Do you drink two or three scotches before passing out in front of the TV?,You are so far off. It's bourbon.
No photos anywhere. Family and friends aren't important?,"Well, you're sick. You have 20 people down the hall and you've had exactly one visitor."
I don't want to panic anyone.,You don't like people. You hide on that ice cube so!
"Stop projecting. You're anti-social, so you assume I'm anti-social.",How about if I just get naked and you shut up?
"If I thought I could get you naked, I would've led with that. You'd rather show me your soul than your leg.",Great. You've got me all figured out. You going to try and fix me now?
We're going to be here all night.,How long does it take you to get naked?
It's the South Pole. I wear a lot of layers. Okay. Ready.,I saw socks. That's not naked.
"Have I mentioned it's freezing here? When they discover lymph nodes in feet, I will take off my socks.","Use your right hand to palpate the nodes. Any node you can feel is one we can biopsy. Let's start with your breasts, move down to the ass, then..."
I was thinking... go from the neck and work my way down.,"Well, you could. But I'd nEver forgive myself if we found something before we got to your breasts."
I'm starting with the anterior cervical nodes.,Turn your head. LoCate the SCM muscle.
I know how to find my lymph nodes.,They teach you that before or after the class on fondling your inner Parkld?
"No swelling, no tenderness, and I can hear that, House.",Just thought it might help you relax. Anything in the axillary nodes?
All clear. Both sides.,"Slide your hand to your sternum, pRobe for nodes. Moving slowly downward."
"Down to what, House?","Sorry, can't hear you on account of your heavy breathing."
"I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.",Hold it. Your fingers didn't go quite as deep. Feel that node again.
It!it's swollen.,Looks like you're doing a biopsy.
"Okay, take a deep breath... and insert the needle into the node.","Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with."
You used her name.,"Just trying to move things along, Bob."
You need to pull back on the syringe. You need to pull harder.,You okay?
Are you okay?,It's a valid medical question.
"I have nEver heard you ask a Patient that question. You've nEver asked me that question, and you've seen me fall down a flight of stairs drunk. You've slept with her.","She's 9,000 miles away. And while a certain part of me unfurled!"
"No, you! Somehow you've been intimate with her. Why are you following me?",Thought you were following me.
"No, you are definitely following me.",Where are you going?
Out to lunch.,You nEver go out to lunch. Means there's a reason you're going out to lunch. I assume that reason is a huMan being.
Or a sandwich.,Sandwiches can come here.
So can huMan beings.,"Yet she's not, which I find interesting."
I'm leaving now.,Small world.
Are you going to follow me into my car?,It's got two doors.
"Call off your dogs, House. Your little helpers are interrogating my Patients, swiping my charts, intercepting prescriptions.",Why would you think that I'm!
Because I'm not a moron. You had to be pulling the strings here. You think that because they make me miserable I'm going to give you cable?,Let's assume that's true. And it certainly sounds like it might be. What are you going to do?
Nothing. I resigned from the budget committee. I only joined the committee to help the hospital. You made me a liability. I now have zero influence over the hospital's cable policy.,Well done.
It didn't work. There's nothing more that we can do.,Put these up.
Free Rottweiler puppies. Please call after 11:00 pm and before 5:00 am. Is this Cameron's home number?,"I love a new puppy. My last one was delicious, very tender."
There's no point in torturing her.,"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one."
"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.","Harm suggests perManent damage. Get her to screw up, then fix it. Oh, and this time, don't tell her what you're going to do before you do it."
"No, I hope it's something, It's maybe Oh, no! I'm screwed.",Bad news is you're 0 for 2 in the kidney department.
Is there good news? You're back at home.,Of course. There's cable. And the freedom to work pant-free.
That is good news.,Wilson found signs of inflammation in your biopsy. That plus the two failing kidneys points to autoimmune disease. PRobably SLE or vasculitis. Treatment for both is prednisone. Start with 100 milligrams...
"Autoimmune is just your latest theory. Like cancer before that, and a kidney stone before.","Take the prednisone, you'll get better, that'll be your confirmation."
"You practice medicine like it's a fire sale. You've wasted antibiotics, X-rays.",That was not a waste. We ruled out!
"We have a crew member here who has asthma. If he has an episode after I've used up the prednisone, he'll die.","There a good chance he's going to die anyway, since there won't be a doctor there to help him."
We should send her outside.,"Right, just tell her to head north until she runs into a hospital."
Is that my wallet?,"Yeah, you can have it back. I've already been through it. I like your ice on a sprain metaphor. Makes it seem like we're not killing her."
She'd only need to be outside five minutes.,Without her mittens. Mom told me that was a bad idea. Especially that winter it was 70 below and I had dual kidney failure.
"You didn't touch the cash, but you took the receipts?","$190 restaurant tab. That's dessert, pRobably booze. Means you lingered. Means it's at least the third date. Means!"
Where are you going?,To talk to the people I pay to come up with medical ideas.
"There are no ideas. The test for autoimmune is ANA. Unless penguins poop immuno-analysers, she's not!","Before A.N.A. testing, people had autoimmune diseases. How did they know?"
C3.,Before that.
You don't need them.,"When you shake the test tube, the paperclip will damage some of your blood cells. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system will gorge itself on the damaged cells. They'll get big and fat so you can see them under a microscope. How you doing?"
No change. So how long should I give the cells to fatten up before I check them?,Couple hours. Or you could stop being a hypocrite and take the prednisone now.
Not bending to your will makes me a hypocrite?,"If your psych Patients deManded lab results, you'd nEver make a diagnosis."
"So I'm wrong. You sleep like a baby, your life is unfolding as you dreamed.",Everyone is miserable. You don't change that because people don't change.
You want to beliEve that because then you're freed from any responsibility for your misery.,Oh shut up. I get enough of this from Wilson.
"And yet you keep hanging out with him. And from what I hear, you have spent more time with me than with any other Patient.",Sorry about that. Call me when you get the results.
How's your Patient?,She has an autoimmune disease. Tell the psych department she's in denial.
"Taub caught the error in time. If she'd just admitted the mistake, maybe I could've just suspended her. But... she's packing up, if you want to say good-bye.",We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes.
That's it?,Well there's nothing to be done. She screwed up. She's got no one to blame but herself.
I got to go talk to Cameron.,"Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up and if she did, she wouldn't come to me. And if she did, she wouldn't open with, ""how's your Patient."" And if she did..."
Why would she lie?,"Timeless question. In this case, she conspired with your coworkers to teach me that some things are more important than cable. And I'm gonna have to teach them that they're wrong. Come on, South Pole really should be calling."
LE Prep test was negative. It's not autoimmune.,You're basing that on a test done with a paperclip. Just take the prednisone.
Either find another diagnosis or find another test.,There is one way. You can take this experimental drug called... pred-ni-sone! Your Kidneys start working...
There is another test.,"I, I think Foreman may have just broken up there. What he actually said was there is no other test."
"If I go outside, we'll have our answer? And you knew about this?","I rejected it because if you're frozen solid, it's hard to get the needles into your arms."
At least five minutes.,Eight minutes outside would kill a healthy person. And healthy people don't suck on oxygen masks. Healthy people can pee.
"I'll go get Sean, have him come with me.",Just take the prednisone!
Are you all right?,Oh I'm sure she's just fine. Cate? Do you know if there's anyone down there who has a cell phone.
"Took the station mechanic 20 minutes to respond. She'd already slipped into a coma. Started her on prednisone, but no improvement.","Means it's not autoimmune. Good thing she's in a coma, or we'd have to listen to her gloat."
And where are we going?,To find the useful members of my team.
You're letting them off the hook?,"Happy? Because of you, I'm not going to be able to watch law and order in Korean."
Why am I here?,Because I want to ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is or you'd have told me her name.
She doesn't have a name. It's some sort of birth defect.,"There's only about 12 people we both know. I can't remember five of their names, so we're down to... Cuddy! Your ex-wives..."
Your mama. You need to run a kidney function test.,"Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma, we could get her to run a test to find out why she's in a coma. The results would likely be paradoxical. Can't be Cuddy, 'cause you're straight. Can't be!"
We could talk the mechanic through the test.,Too compliCated... Unless he's thirsty.
And then you can fix it?,Let's say yeah.
Take a straight catheter and insert it...,"These are your only questions? Not, is it safe? Or, is there another way? Or, are you out of your minds?"
You wouldn't ask me if!,"Wait a second. You're in love with her. That explains why you're so eager to get her naked, then have a drink. Cause most guys like to go the other way around."
Why do you care how I feel about her?,"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg."
"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg.",You got Cameron fired.
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.,No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.
No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.,Wrong.
We're still fired?,That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say.
We're sorry.,Wrong.
I love you.,Wrong.
Wrong.,"Right. You should've said this two days ago. Do not play games with me. Number one, you're going to lose, you're just not ready. Number two, the game was to force you to stop playing games. I need you to stand up to me. Challenge me. I need you to stop worrying about getting fired. Go pay for my cable."
No!,"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable."
"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable.","Milk, milk, lemonade?"
This tastes kind of watery.,That's bad news.
How do you figure out which one it is?,"We don't do anything. You're going to drill a hole in her skull. If she regains consciousness, it's increased intracranial pressure."
And if it's the other thing?,"She'll die. But if it's the hypothalamus, she's dead anyway."
"If the pRoblem is the pressure in her brain, and I fix it, is she going to be all better?","Nope, but it'll give us more time to figure out what's wrong."
I have to get someone else. I can't do this.,"You love her, right? You'd do anything to save her."
"Not this. I can't do this. If, if she dies because of something that I did, then I!","Listen, listen. I am not going to let you hurt her. Okay? Now please... This is her only chance."
Okay.,"Well, that was easy."
"Bone's harder than wood, lean into it. The skull's only a quarter-inch thick. Once you're midway through, drill in shorter bursts.","If it comes out the other side, you've gone too far."
"Okay, now what? Now what?",Let the fluid drain.
Sean? What's going on?,"South Pole doc is out of her coma, and now we have a new symptom. Increased intracranial pressure."
Why are we out here?,That's the Patient room. ICP plus kidney pRoblems plus lung collapse equals?
We ruled out cancer.,But not clots. What causes blood clots?
Deep vein thrombosis plus an existing PFO.,PFO would've been discovered in her pre-South Pole physical exam.
"What if the clots aren't clots? Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up on the arterial walls, pieces break off, block blood flow. Explains Everything.","She has zero risk factors. Forget fat, think clots."
No.,You're standing up to me?
Maybe.,Just to clarify. You should do that when you're right. Sorry for the confusion. How could a clot!
"Could be a different kind of fat, fat emboli.","That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire! See, that's what I'm talking about."
"That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire! See, that's what I'm talking about.",Take off her socks.
"No, I got it.",Your toe is broken.
"Oh, my god.","Bits of bone marrow have been leaking into your blood stream. Those fat emboli have caused blockages in your kidney, lungs, and brain."
It doesn't Even hurt.,Cold numbs Everything. Does a particularly great job on the extremities.
You'll need to close the break to stop the marrow from leaking.,This one you will feel.
Will you do it?,He drilled a hole in your skull after drinking your pee. I think he's up for this.
"Grab the tip of her toe with your right hand. Hold the break with the other. On the count of three, pull hard. One... two... three.",Now splint your toe. You'll be fine.
"Thank you, House.",Don't thank me. He's the one who saved your life. He likes her.
A bottle of the Bordeaux and some sParkling water.,"Well, you didn't pick her up. Which means she's coming from work too. Which means you're comfortable enough to meet her."
Damn. Thought I lost you when I walked backwards through my own footprints in the snow.,I think I've got it narrowed down to three possibilities.
"Better leave, if you see her, it'll be cheating.",It's not one of your ex-wives.
Because they hate me.,"They don't. They should, but they don't. I called them. Someone new, but someone I know."
Did you Ever consider being happy for me?,Briefly. You ordering the wine before she got here!
"Girls are good, House. And you know it. You solved your case because you cared about that girl.",You're demonstrating the illusion of Manly confidence. Which means you haven't closed the deal yet.
I closed the deal. I just like her.,Still?
"You knew your Patient hated having cold feet because you did a physical exam, because you liked her.","Your theory is I cared, therefore I let her keep her socks on? If that's what love is, then I don't want to have anything to do with it."
It starts with warm feet but leads to other things. Your mom and I will explain when you're older.,"If I'd made her take them off like I should've, I would've seen the toe and would've solved the case days ago."
Sorry I'm late.,Cut throat bitch?
I know you chose well for me. I've been blessed.,Cross-species mating. I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.
Amber and I have a lot in common.,She's a Cutthroat Bitch. You cry over Dark Victory.
"Bette Davis - another strong, assertive Woman.","You don't like strong, you don't like assertive. You like needy."
"You don't like strong, you don't like assertive. You like needy.","She's not dying, is she?"
Yes. Go 'way.,I give it two months.
Hundred bucks.,Not really fair. You're not objective. But I'm all about the teaParkng...
We're at four months.,You hid this from me?
"I was wrong, okay? I thought you'd be upset. I thought you'd track me down in the hallways, and...",You shouldn't have discounted the sex. She's obviously limber enough to put off the meltdown for two months.
She's not needy. I don't need needy.,She's scary. Why does Scary need Pathetic?
Are you gonna talk to her?,I don't see that I have any choice.
I don't see that I have any choice.,You all right with that?
You all right with that?,No impulse to save her from me?
"Thirty-eight-year-old female with loss of bladder control, blood in her urine and a broken leg from collapsing at her wedding.",Ampicillin for the UTI. Shiny cast for the leg. You guys know Wilson's dating Amber?
Cultures were negative for UTIs. No signs of previous trauma or STDs.,Kidney cancer.
CT was clean for tumors and kidney stones.,I thought Amber scared you guys.
She does. But she also has legs that go all the way up to Canada.,So do Canadians. Doesn't mean I wanna date one.
Low sodium could also be from low food. Hasidic Jews fast on their wedding day.,Or... sodium was absorbed by a toxin already in her system. Was it just the legs? Or did you detect something resembling a soul?
"That much carbolic acid, someone would've had to poison her.","Coulda been a Cossack. If this was eighteenth-century Poland and Cossacks were into Household cleansers. Which is why it's more likely that the poisoner was ""poisonee""."
Suicide's a sin.,"Corollary of ""people lie"" is ""people sin"". In my world, ""people"" includes Jews."
She was getting married.,"Hasidic women marry young so they can start pushing out little Hasidilings. Thirty-eight means a Woman not on anyone's hot-list. Being pushed onto a guy who's not on anyone's hot-list. No way out, no way out..."
Endometriosis fits better than an epiphany that her life is meaningless. We should start her on AIs and do a cystoscopy to confirm.,Fine.
Fine.,"Check her innards for bad cells and her home for bad karma. Carbolic acid should be on her shelf, right next to the regret and the self-loathing."
So you can nEver watch Star Wars again.,You figured that I'll hire you...
You figured that I'll hire you...,... if you promised to dump Wilson.
How did you...?,Wilson had a key.
Wilson had a key.,"You figure that I'll make your life hell at first, but I'll Eventually see how good you are and keep you."
"It's a good plan, don't you think? Perfectly tailored to your personality.","No, it's not. You know it's not. Means you just wanna stay in my orbit 'cause you figure I'll Eventually realize that I made a mistake and you're gonna be able to rub my face in it."
I can't wait. It's gonna be awesome.,"No, it's not. And you know it's not. 'Cause you know that Even if I made a mistake, I'd nEver admit that I made a mistake. Which means that you're just toying with Wilson to toy with me."
"No, it's not. And you know it's not. 'Cause you know that Even if I made a mistake, I'd nEver admit that I made a mistake. Which means that you're just toying with Wilson to toy with me.",Your goal is pure feral vengeance.
"Innocent bystander, but there's a greater good.","No, that's not it. Because a bag of flaming poop bypasses the bystander."
"So... which is it, House? Am I in this for you? Or am I in this for him?",Give him back his sweatshirt. 'Pit stains don't become you.
Cryoglobulinemia might account for the symptoms.,Except for the one you missed.
There's no change in her condition.,I'm not talking about a new symptom. I'm talking about one that presented six months ago.
"Look, she's nuts, but we can't just give her ten ccs of atheism and send her home.","Religion is a symptom of irrational belief and groundless hope. Altered mental status, on the other hand, is a symptom of porphyria."
"She didn't dEvelop uncontrollable anger, crying, anxiety. She just decided to go to temple.","The Woman didn't _just_ choose to keep kosher. She went directly to the extremes of Hasidism, a life of stringent rules. She became a masoParkst."
"She didn't like her old life, so she changed it.",People don't change. They might want to. They need to.
Taub gave up a six figure plastic surgery career for this job. That mean he has porphyria?,He switched jobs to save his marriage. He did it to avoid change.
"No, no, if she walked away from Everything to go base jumping or live with apes, we wouldn't be having this discussion.",We would if she was also tinkling blood out of her overexcited bladder. Pump Hadassah full of hematin and give her a phlebotomy.
"Then we will settle for second-best, someone who doesn't think my wife is sick just because she's religious.","If you prefer, I can give your wife my second-best diagnosis."
"If you prefer, I can give your wife my second-best diagnosis.",D'you know Wilson's dating Amber?
I have reviewed the chart. Someone on your team must have pointed out that cryoglobulinemia also fits the symptoms.,"Yes, it fits _Many_ of the symptoms."
My wife's body is sick. Her mind and soul are fine.,"You live according to God's six hundred comMandments, right?"
Six hundred Thirteen.,You understand them all?
Takes a lifetime of learning...,"But you follow the ones you don't understand because the ones you do understand make sense, and you beliEve that the guy who created them knows what he's doing."
Of course.,"So you will trust my diagnosis and you'll let me treat her, because in this temple, I am Dr. Yahweh."
I'm starting her on indomethacin for cryoglobulinemia.,"People don't change. For example, I'm gonna keep repeating ""people don't change""."
So alcoholics that successfully go through treatment don't exist.,"They're still alcoholics. If they nEver take a drink as long as they live, it's only 'cause they didn't live long enough."
It's definitely not cryoglobulinemia.,Better ask Him.
"Her respiratory rate stabilized, and her O-sat's back up to 95. Saw Amber drop off Wilson this morning.",Yes. The male always drives the female. So what caused the breathing pRoblem?
Wegener's would explain her elevated sed rate.,Wegener's wouldn't explain the changed mental status.
"Actually, we've been trying to ignore that part of the whiteboard.","Well, I wrote it in black. I'm always serious when I use black. Lupus would explain..."
Maybe she didn't change.,Are you agreeing with me or you making a point?
I'm making a point.,That's gonna take longer.
How do we know that the real Roz isn't who she is now and who she was then? Can't we say that her previous life was true without making her present one a fraud?,"""Life is messy"" argument. Nice. Explains Everything without explaining anything. If it's lupus, there's a heart pRoblem we don't know about yet. Run her through a stress test. If she has a heart attack, I'm right."
Or we could wait. Hope that...,You're afraid to give her a heart attack.
Of course we're afraid to...,No reason to be afraid. Unless you think I'm right.
But we'll have the crash cart just in case.,"Oh, my God! What are you guys doing here?"
"Oh, my God! What are you guys doing here?",I had a sudden yen for Fusion.
"That's okay. Hi, Greg. And I call you Greg because we're now social equals.","I call you Cutthroat Bitch... well, Quod erat demonstrandum. And I speak in Latin because I don't try to hide what an ass I am."
We've been waiting for...,"Any minute now, she's gonna hit him in the face with your testicles."
She tends to treat ev... She tends to treat Every Event like it's the last copter out of Saigon.,She's the anti-Wilson. She's a force for evil.
"She has an annoying quality. Perhaps Even two. If I was perfect, I would date perfect.",You like that!
"It's annoying, but she's good at it.",Wait a second.
Wait a second.,This isn't just about the sex. You like her personality. You like that she's conniving. You like that she has no regard for consequences. You like that she can humiliate someone if it serves...
This isn't just about the sex. You like her personality. You like that she's conniving. You like that she has no regard for consequences. You like that she can humiliate someone if it serves...,"Oh, my God. You're sleeping with me."
Heart's strong enough to prove you wrong about the change in mental status.,Only proves this isn't lupus. Just as the leg pain proves it isn't Wegener's.
Leg pain can be from nerve entrapment. We're thinking blood clot.,Do an MRI to look for the clot. Then do an fMRI.
An MRI alone will detect...,If the clot hasn't dissolved. An fMRI can show signs of near-ischemic stroke in post-ischemic parts of the brain.
If the clot hasn't dissolved. An fMRI can show signs of near-ischemic stroke in post-ischemic parts of the brain.,Gimme ten bucks.
No.,I missed lunch.
I thought you went...,I missed lunch!
I don't give a damn.,How's our Mental Yentl?
MRI shows no sign of clots. fMRI shows no pRoblem areas.,Go restart her IV.
What's wrong with it?,"Nothing. But like so Many procedures we put Patients through, it hurts. Which, if she's enjoying it, will show up in pretty colors."
This is why you wanted an fMRI?,"It showed she didn't have a blood clot, which is diagnostically relevant. And it can show that she's become a masoParkst, also diagnostically relevant. And it'll be cool."
"It showed she didn't have a blood clot, which is diagnostically relevant. And it can show that she's become a masoParkst, also diagnostically relevant. And it'll be cool.",Either explain which part of my analysis didn't make sense. Or go do it.
Sorry.,Heavens. Look at her limbic system. Pleasure centers are lighting up like a Hanukkah bush. Foreman must have a touch like an elephant.
"Okay, Roz. We've got what we need.","Yes, it _was_ impressive."
She's stabilizing.,Get her up.
Get her up.,All the way up. On her feet.
All the way up. On her feet.,Make her do that again.
"When you stand up, your BP and heart rate are supposed to go up, not...",Got it.
Got it.,"So what causes bloody urine, loss of bladder control, leg pain, altered mental status, and pressure-blood in direction-wrong?"
Pheochromocytoma.,Low Catecholamines in the urine means no pheochromocytoma in the Jewess.
Could be systemic sclerosis.,Mental status!
She was praying.,She was in pain. You no longer think she's crazy?
I can... see why she'd be attracted... to that life.,You drank the Manishewitz-flavored Kool-Aid.
I'm not saying I agree. I'm just saying...,That there's a rational basis for the irrational.
They have something we don't have.,Imaginary friends.
"If the toaster's not working, wiring could be bad.",Which Debate is that metaphor supposed to help us with?
"Electrical pRoblem in the heart. Arrhythmia messes with the blood flow when she stands, causes low BP and heart rate. Could also impact mental status. Everybody's happy.",Run an EP study of her heart. Find where the wiring's verklempt.
Run an EP study of her heart. Find where the wiring's verklempt.,Went by your hotel this morning. They told me you moved out. Moved in with CB?
"No, apparently, I moved in with you.",The very fact that you're resisting my insight proves to me...
"We've known each other for years, We've put up with all kinds of crap from each other, and we keep coming back. We're a couple!",Are we still speaking metaphorically?
Amber is exactly what I need and you would agree if you weren't mired in self-loathing topped with a thin crust of megaloMania.,Hey. That's my best friend's girl you're talking about.
Hey. That's my best friend's girl you're talking about.,I was wrong.
"House, you're right.","She's not me. Well, she is me. But that's... not why she's attractive. She's a needy version of me."
Hard to imagine such a mythical creature.,You started seeing her right after I fired her.
I started seeing her four months ago.,She told Kutner it was four weeks.
She told Kutner it was four weeks.,You lied to me. There was money on the line.
"Because I knew how you'd react, and I knew you wouldn't pay me anyway!",You knew that I was right.
She wasn't needy. She was in a... bad situation. There's a difference.,Not to your libido.
"Yeah, these people aren't gonna change you at all.",I need you to sleep with Wilson.
Good morning.,He's involved with... an inappropriate Woman.
His people are sheep-herders and Amber's are... cattlemen?,He's combined two of his worst qualities - his love for me and his love for need.
He's combined two of his worst qualities - his love for me and his love for need.,"As administrator of this hospital, you have to save your star oncologist."
"Wish I could help, but as administrator, there are some people in Accounting I'm scheduled to sleep with first.","Wilson has a pattern with women. He saves them, then he betrays them. Which then causes guilt. Which then causes him to go save somebody else. For example, a hospital bureaucrat nearing forty who has no personal life. I suggest you go braless."
"I get that ""sleep with"" is your way of saying I should talk to him?","No. I really mean ""sleep with""."
You're not worried this relationship will fail. You're worried it'll succeed. That Wilson will no longer be at your beck and call 24/7. That your best friend will change.,People don't change just because they wish they could.
Blankets too! She's freezing!,She was supposed to sweat and she froze.
Return to the Planet of the Apes.,Hypothermia caused the seizure. What caused the hypothermia?
Complication on a complication?,Body's doing the opposite of what it's supposed to. Her body's Wilson. How do we respond to that?
We accept that he's happy.,We do the opposite.
"So you want us to, what, send the Patient home?","Infection... means that something's been added to the body, something that should be expelled. What's the opposite of that?"
Cortisol. Could be Addison's.,It fits. Every symptom.
I had a Rabbi call. She's adaMant.,"She's not a masoParkst, she's suicidal. Nice work, Chase."
Yeah... I should have had twin Rabbis call. Can I go?,We need you.
We need you.,"So, instead of a few days, we now have a few hours to figure this out. Nice work, Chase."
Why do you need me?,"Saying, ""nice work, Chase"" when you're not here is pointless."
"Saying, ""nice work, Chase"" when you're not here is pointless.","Seriously, we need you."
We should X-ray for malformations of the rib that could cause arterial twisting.,Malformations don't cause bloody urine.
It's who he might be. She's connecting with all the years she's not gonna have.,Better way of connecting to those years is to actually have them.
"Joshua got God to make the sun stand still. No reason God can't speed it up. And, by God, I, of course, mean you.",Told you we needed you.
You wanted to see me?,And you came.
I feel pretty confident it'll be something interesting.,Solve this case and the job is yours.
"Is there a ""Drop Wilson"" clause attached to this?",Standard contract all employees sign.
Why do you have to beliEve I have an ulterior motive?,For the same reason I beliEve that crack whores can have sex... for crack.
Could be DIC.,You've changed.
I hope so.,Normal platelet count rules out DIC. Good try though.
I read that a hydatid cyst could...,"Would affect the lungs, not the bladder."
"When I left, he was still singing Eshet-something.",The husband's blessing of his wife. He calls her Eshet Chayil.
"""Woman of valor"". ""Strength and honor are her clothing. She laughs at the future""...",... because she's an idiot.
Volvulus of the small intestine could cause bleeding.,"She woulda had constipation. Her value isn't ""beyond pearls"" either. 'Cause dead people have no value."
Polycythemia vera.,RBC count would be higher.
Parkinson's would explain the hypothermia.,"Not the bloody urine. Woman's not just a masoParkst, she's a hypocrite."
"Not the bloody urine. Woman's not just a masoParkst, she's a hypocrite.",The comMandment to preserve life comes before all others.
"Actually, it means she's not a masoParkst. She's not following all the rules, just the ones that please her.","Right, she walked in crazy and explained how ritual trumps living, and you decide it's a beautiful lifestyle."
But if there's nothing more...,Then the only meaning is here.
If she lives her life believing that God is there...,Then she dies.
Then she dies.,Things aren't where we want them to be just 'cause we want them to be there.
Things aren't where we want them to be just 'cause we want them to be there.,"'Course, that doesn't mean they're where they should be."
"'Course, that doesn't mean they're where they should be.",Hey! Stop that Jew!
Hey! Stop that Jew!,Chase hates working on Shabbos. Gonna make this easier for him. Stand her up.
She doesn't do so well on her feet.,Neither do I. Stand her up.
Neither do I. Stand her up.,You can tell all the ladies at the Mikvah about this.
What are you doing?,Put your hand here. Press hard.
Put your hand here. Press hard.,"You have nephroptosis. Also known as ""floating kidney"". The kidney's like a chandelier."
"You have nephroptosis. Also known as ""floating kidney"". The kidney's like a chandelier.",It's attached to a ceiling of intestines and blood vessels. But your contractor - think you know who he is - he hung it with a cheap chain. It's been hanging sloppy for years.
Finally something shook it loose.,"After that, Every time you stood, your kidney dropped a few centimeters, caused all your symptoms."
None of the scans picked it up.,Because we do scans with Patients lying down. She'd've been lying down in surgery too. We would nEver have found it. Good chance she'd nEver come out.
She'll be all right?,"Ultrasound to confirm, then tell Chase to put the kidney back on the shelf. The bleed will be nearby."
That's... it?,Mazel tov.
Mazel tov.,"Couple hours surgery, you'll be ready to push out those fourteen Parkldren."
"Couple hours surgery, you'll be ready to push out those fourteen Parkldren.","You do it both ways, right?"
What?,The ultrasound. You do it standing up and lying down.
The ultrasound. You do it standing up and lying down.,What else would I mean?
What else would I mean?,I've decided you could do worse than a female proxy for me.
So you're going to acknowledge that people can change?,No.
You think I've changed or Amber's changed?,Nope.
Then you've changed.,"If you do change, can it be the part of you that Chases me down halls, trying to change me?"
Do you know what this means?,That you made one good dating choice. The fabric of the space/time continuum could unravel.
And yet you're going along with it. Are you being... self-sacrificing?,I'll sacrifice... a lab rat. I'll sacrifice a fly. I'll sacrifice two hundred on a mudder at Monmouth Park. I don't sacrifice self.
I'll sacrifice... a lab rat. I'll sacrifice a fly. I'll sacrifice two hundred on a mudder at Monmouth Park. I don't sacrifice self.,"Shabbat Shalom, Wilson."
"You okay? Oh, my god, Jeff!",The place is a mess.
"Welcome to a world without nurses. Here, you can start with these.","It's not my fault, I don't use nurses."
"Cuddy was looking for you, said she'd send you down here.","I know, that's why I'm here."
Because Cuddy hasn't found you yet.,She's going to look Everywhere except the place she wants me to be. Hey.
I've got an aortic dissection here.,What's with the idiot?
Ah.. Fainting spell and recent history of dysgeusia. Everything tastes like lemon meringue pie. You want to take him?,No. Sir. Why do you have two lunches in front of you?
Been here for two meals.,And you're happy with that?
"No, I just don't see much use in complaining.","Seriously? It's a very useful tool. Complain, you make people miserable. They do what you want to make the misery go away."
I'm sure it was an accident.,Is he Canadian?
"Uh, he's a low priority...",Is that a yes?
He's just...,Happy. I've got to stop this before it spreads. You guys are done.
Happy. I've got to stop this before it spreads. You guys are done.,"Could be a metabolic disorder, toxic exposure, carcinoma of the tongue metastasized to the brain, Epilepsy, MS!"
"No, you're ignoring the big symptom. What if we're looking at both the flu and decent parenting?","Okay, you two are perfectly healthy. This guy wasn't pandering, he wasn't vanilla nice, he was nice without any aspiration for personal gain. I'm thinking genetic defect."
Niceness is a defect?,"Three cavemen, see a stranger running towards them with a spear. One fights, one flees, one smiles and invites him over for fondue. That last guy didn't last long enough to procreate."
And how long has the Patient been... suffering?,"At least as long as his wife has known him, 11 years."
The chances of him having an undiagnosed pathology for that long...,"What are you saying? That evolution is wrong? Where do you think we are, 21st Century America?"
"You want it to be a symptom because then we're supposed to be jerks, which means you don't Even have to try to be nice.","Okay, maybe I'm biased, let's take a vote. Who thinks that niceness is not a symptom? And who thinks that their vote counts? You two check out his home for toxins. Taub and Thirty-One..."
Thirty-One?,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you. Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors and EEG for nerve damage. Test whatEver comes out of him for Everything else."
Too much axis tilt. Don't release until your thumb's at the bottom of the ball. I assume Wilson was busy.,Again.
No axis tilt. With Amber?,Again.
"Still, it was nice of you to invite me, this is fun.","No, it wasn't. No, it isn't. I didn't invite you to be nice, I invited you because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves."
What's the second thing?,Other hand.
"Well if people are incapable of being nice, why bother having the word?","Ah, the ontological proof of niceness. The existence of the word proves the existence of the concept. Look out for those minotaurs on your drive home."
"I thought motives didn't matter, only results mattered. So what are you going to do to screw up Wilson's relationship so you don't have to listen to me while you bowl?",I wish the best for them and their tragically deformed Parkldren.
"Well, she's good... At being bad. You might not be able to destroy her.","Well as long as I give it my best shot, I can hold my head high."
"Cameron had this one insufferable friend. She wasn't going to get rid of her and I sure wasn't going to join them, so I just said, see her on Thursday's. I know it's not as exciting as an exploding birthday cake, but, hell, I don't want to hang out with her Every night anyway.",That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend?
That's amazing. Cameron only has one insufferable friend?,Joint custody.
Of Wilson?,Unless we have another love Parkld?
Deal with him.,"He needs a mother figure. I'm not saying you're not entitled to spend time with him, I'm just saying I'm entitled too."
"No, crazy is what House would normally do in this situation... Swap your lubricant with superglue.",The Man knows me.
This is his way of accepting us.,It's actually a very touParkng moment. I'm proposing I get Every other day and Every other weekend.
"I have yoga Wednesday's, you can have him then. But you have to have him home by 11. We can swap weekends.","Mondays and Wednesdays, and midnight."
"If he's not home till midnight, we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.",Wilson? Make a ruling.
"Uh no. You two are like dogs circling each other in the Park. And I say that with all the love in the world. You need to sniff each other's butts, bare your teeth, and arrive at some strange detente. Otherwise, you'll end up biting each other's eyes out. Again, with all the love in the world.",I'll let you sniff first.
"Take my deal, or get out of my apartment.","Take my deal, or I move in."
Wouldn't that be nice?,"You are King Solomon. If you want us to cut him in half, we're cool with that."
You are overtly contemptuous of hospital hierarchy.,And covertly. But I suppose you didn't know about that.
"Your attitude towards supervisory personnel is disrespectful, and a disturbingly large proportion of your comments are racist or sexist.",That top makes you look like an Afghani prostitute... Would be an example of that.
"House, I got the...","It can wait. I will sign, if you will give us a ruling."
"I will give you a ruling, if you do the reviews on your team.",I'd be happy to continue the mockery of this process.
Wednesday's till 11:00 and alternate weekends.,Yes. Wednesday nights are ladies' nights at Cheetah's.
Calcium's normal.,Wow. It really could wait.
Everything's normal.,And you thought it wouldn't be.
"He's a carpet cleaner, he's got a home full of hydrofluoric acid.",Doesn't mean his calcium should be low.
"Yeah, actually it kinda does, HF causes lower lEvels of...","LowER, not low."
Lower than normal.,"Lower than yesterday. Yesterday might have been high, what's lower than high?"
"He actually has hypercalcemia, which is being lowered to normal by the HF.","So what gives us elevated calcium, bad taste, and fainting?"
I take it you know?,Get the team. This is going to be fun.
Get the team. This is going to be fun.,"Hello, again. These people think you are not too nice."
Too nice? For what?,For life as we know it to have evolved without an intelligent designer. I'm going to prove them wrong. Your wife... is very ugly.
Deb. He's obviously trying to prove a point.,I think I just did. You're either perfect or you're sick. In my experience sick is much more common.
"He's not sick, he's nice.",Nice in the sense that your toaster is nice for making you breakfast. It's the only thing his wiring will let him do. He has William's syndrome. Your husband is missing the genes that make him suspicious.
"You're wrong, he's!","Relax, there's no cure. He's going to go right on tasting lemon meringue pie, fainting, and being a sap."
What about the other symptoms?,He has no other symptoms.
But William's does.,"He's got the teeth, glasses."
William's cuts IQ by 20...,He doesn't work in the physics department. Except when they spill a black hole on their carpet.
Elfin appearance?,"Yeah, he's more legolas than Keebler, but I bet you he can still crack off a batch of Pecan Sandies."
Perfect pitch?,"You love to karaoke, right?"
I suck.,"Modest, another symptom..."
"No, he really does suck.",Give us a warble. You know any Cher?
He's stroking.,Not a moment too soon.
You were wrong.,"Why do people say that with such pleasure? It's very hurtful, you know?"
It means the Patient gets to keep being nice. Why does that offend you?,"It's the way he said it. He wasn't reliEved, he was excited. He was also wrong, and I say that with no sense of pleasure."
"Patient tested negative for William's, which means the stroke and Everything else wasn't caused by...","You. Have a friendly demeanor, but you sometimes get too involved. You relate well to your peers and Patients and you complete tasks in a timely Manner. Please sign."
What the hell was that?,I have to give each of you perforMance reviews. Plenty of other conditions can cause Debilitating niceness.
How is that supposed to help him?,"I don't know. How's it supposed to help Wilson? Cross out Wilson's name and the date, and then fill in your own..."
The point of a review is to give feedback to help...,I'm thinking neurosyphilis. Wouldn't show up on the MRI without contrast.
"He doesn't think it's syphilis, but he's going to go run those tests anyway.",Because he doesn't know. That's why we do tests.
"Because he's a wimp, because he's afraid of you.",You want me to intimidate him into not being afraid? Not sure I know how to do that.
"Reviews make a difference. People have to listen, so they have to learn.",I don't think that the right time to tell the dog not to pee on the rug is semi-annually.
You don't want to do the paperwork.,I am concerned about the rainforest.
I'll do it.,I know.
"I'm not perfect. But she loves me, and she's always loved me. Every minute, Every day.",You're 15 minutes late!
Have you heard the good news?,Miley Cyrus is playing a third night at the spectrum?
"Happiness is possible. And not just in this life, but in the next...","Oh, you're selling religion. I'm sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday."
"Well, it's where your light shows signs before mending... Have a good Evening.",You're late.
15 minutes.,"16 minutes, MY 16 minutes."
So keep him an extra 16 minutes.,You hear that? She doesn't care.
"You're going mini golfing, what's it matter? You got a tee off time?",It matters because you don't get to decide what matters.
Which was my fault.,I had to take a dump. Anything else I don't need to know before you leave?
"Have fun on your play date. You've got mummy's numbers, right?",Daddy needs a drink.
Are you trying to get me drunk? What time is it?,10:30.
Ooh... She'll kill you.,I'll get you home before lights out.
"Great, then she'll kill me. If I get, if I get any more drunk, then I'm... It... Might not work. If you, uh, know what I mean.",Really? You'd think that one or more of your ex wives would have mentioned that to me.
"They told you? Wait, why do you want to get Amber angry?",Because I'm your friend.
"No, no, no. You said you approved, you said you were taking the high road. For how long, the first exit?","Hello, and thank you for saving me from being righteoused to death."
Hematemesis could indiCate...,Don't put it on the board.
You don't think it's a symptom?,"I think it's my marker. He has syph, and what?"
"And syph, it can cause hematemesis.",Not Everyone agrees.
How... How could you...,"If you all thought it was syph, you wouldn't have woken me up in the middle of the night."
"The bleeding's pRobably from liver damage, pRobably caused by ethanol in the cleansers or the penicillin.",Two more pRobablys than I like to hear.
Liver tests and serologies are going to take a full day.,"Full night, actually. Guy might not make it to brunch. Yes, I knew about your issue with alcohol. Yes, I intentionally got you drunk to provoke an argument between you and Amber. Why I would do such a thing is an interesting question. What's more interesting is that you knew as much as I did and you're the one who's pouring down the drinks. Why?"
Could it be any worse on her than loving somebody who can't love them back?,Yes?
You might want to turn off the TV.,I'm multi-tasking. Also doing my taxes. And Cuddy. What'd you find out?
The Patient has hepatitis.,I assume from your omission of the word 'viral' before the hep that it's not another STD. Put him on steroids and test him for sarcoid before the liver failure becomes liver failed.
We're all doing this.,There's more?
You have syphilis.,"No, I don't."
One of us found a vial of your blood in the lab...,Which one of you?
"You did, didn't you?",There's something I need to tell you.
You returned him drunk.,On time.
Drunk.,On time. No tag backs.
The purpose of the time was to give me time.,So you didn't have sex?
I like sex.,Well you can have it tonight. The L Word is on.
"You don't get to decide what matters. Either you're genuinely afraid I'm going to make him miserable, or you're afraid I'm going to make him happy, or you simply can't stop screwing with anything that moves. It doesn't really matter, because whatEver the reason, you'll only get worse. Until either I stop seeing Wilson, or I stop you. What do you think I'm going to choose?","If you terminate the agreement, it's not going to bring peace in the mideast."
I'm not terminating the agreement. I'm amending the agreement. I'm adding penalty clauses.,Fine. WhoEver violates it gets their finger cut off.
I'm serious.,"So am I. You want people to drive safer, take out the airbags and attach a machete pointing at their neck. No one will drive over three miles per hour."
I'm not cutting...,We'll figure it out. On your time. You know she's certifiable right? I've got the forms in my desk.
Where is she wrong? What were you going to tell me?,Nothing.
You're punishing me?,I needed to tell you something... privately.
I'm not going to tell her.,"You'll tell her. She's your girlfriend, you should tell her."
You're my friend.,It's not the same.
Don't sulk.,Where am I wrong?
"Your Management style is counterproductive. You gave me authority over the team, just so they could undercut...",Critiquing the clap addled? That's sort of tasteless.
I didn't feel like waiting until your genitals cleared up. You need to formalise my authority over the team.,"No, I don't."
You don't think I'm qualified?,Compared to those three?
You want to punish Cuddy for hiring me without...,I like Cuddy. I like parts of her.
You want to crush the team by crushing me?,"I want to empower them. Those three idiots need to respect you. They should respect you, they should be afraid of you, so I have to humiliate you, because if the team fears you, they won't question you. If they don't question you, they won't get any answers, if they don't get any answers, they're useless."
Mocking me saves lives?,"The hospital will pRobably build you a statue one day. You know, with a 'kick me' sign on the back. So when you think about it, the more I mock you, the more it shows I have respect for you."
Or you made up that BS because you like humiliating me.,Wouldn't rule that out completely.
You busy?,"Almost done. Uh, so just remember, the rabbit goes around the tree and jumps down the hole."
Negative for sarcoidosis.,"Run him for Everything you can think of. Lepto, sParksto, hemo, and the fourth Marx brother nobody Ever heard of."
She saved his life.,"Or she scabbed. Depends on your point of view. So what do we think? New symptom? Or just a wife beater? Hey, time for you to take this baby for a spin."
"We, uh, loaded him full of prednisone to try to fix the liver.","Good news is, he's running out of organs to fail."
Roid rage after six hours?,"At that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us."
"It's not frying his liver, it's frying his syphilis. The penicillin's working, the real Patient is emerging.",So... syphilis prEvents domestic violence. I'm going to be Even more attractive to the ladies.
I was going to test for a heart issue before the syphilis. PFO could explain the heart attack and reduced blood flow to the brain could explain the rage.,"Well, they're all good ideas. Okay, let's take a vote. How Many think it's the roids talking? And who's for the penicillin? And how about whatEver she said? Someone hasn't raised their hand."
WhatEver I decide? You're setting me up.,Why would I do that?
PFO.,The PFO's have it. I just hope the bubble test is positive or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.
"You had no choice, you had to treat him. What's done is done.","You know that thing I was going to tell you, I've got to tell you. I've got to tell someone. You have to swear not to tell CB."
WhatEver.,"Well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging. It's actually the opposite of swearing."
I won't tell Amber.,My team thinks that I have syphilis.
Do you?,Not yet.
Why do they think you do?,"Because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something."
Why would you swap your blood? What are you afraid they'll find?,"Shut up, you're missing the point. Now, they think that I'm on penicillin."
Is this some clEver practical joke that I'm not aware of?,"And as I get better, I get nicer."
That's brilliant.,"Foreman thinks I actually value his opinion. Thank god he said PFO, or I'd have had to do some dancing. You got time for bowling? Come on, it's work hours."
I'll get my shoes. So we don't need to talk about...,No.
So you're going to keep screwing...,"Yeah, and you're going to keep talking about it. We are who we are."
"Patient tested positive for syphilis, right?",Is this some sort of recap?
But why did he test positive for syphilis?,Oh! Uh... I know this.
"Either one, he has syphilis...",I was going to say that.
"Or two, the test was wrong twice, or three, he gave us someone else's blood.",Who?
Amber.,Get that idiotic smile out of my face. I've got to go on a killing spree.
"Or, four, he has something that tests positive for syphilis.",It's not chagas.
He worked in Costa Rica before he was married.,"Is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too? Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness."
"I've heard of remote tribes that actually practice acts of kindness, or the chagas caused encephalitis.",The MRI showed no signs...
"Until we started him on steroids, compromised the immune system and let the infection flare up. I did another one. It's not much.",It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Damn. That should have been my epiphany.
It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Damn. That should have been my epiphany.,"Good news, bad news. Good news is we know what you have, it's treatable, you're going to live."
What's the bad news?,The cure is a grueling course of pills. It's like one a day for a month.
Now you're just trying to make me laugh.,"Yeah, like that's a challenge."
"You have chagas disease. It's a parasite, it's been asymptomatic for ten years.","Well not quite. Your brain's been swollen, not enough to see but enough to alter your personality."
Now we're back to that.,"He screamed at you, you don't think he can change?"
That was because of the drugs.,So you think drugs are more powerful than parasites? I mean... The ones we're going to give you to treat the parasites obviously are but... I stand by the principle.
Neither am I.,"Neither am I, but that's because I don't care."
Reviews?,"It was brought to my attention that on occasion, I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy."
"The word was ""contemptuous."" Well phrased, thoughtful. Identically phrased. These are all the same.","Because, underneath it all, we are all the same. And Foreman refused to type his up."
"Well, it's more than I expected.",There's an extra one in there.
"Your treatment of Patients is non-existent because you're not a doctor, you're an administrator.",Foreman convinced me that these can be helpful.
"Your Management of employees is, well, let's face it, they're outside carrying signs. The strike ended, the nurses have been back for two shifts already.","You'd think I'd have noticed. What exactly did they do around here? You act like employees should fear and respect you, but your eyes tell us... Actually your eyes tell us nothing because we're looking at your boobs. Which tell us that you're desperate to have someone jump on you and tell you they love you one grunted syllable at a time. What you want, you run away from. What you need, you don't have a clue. What you've accomplished makes you proud, but you're still miserable. Please sign."
I got a call from Amber today. Says there's been a violation of your contract. You've been seeing Wilson on her time.,"She breached confidentiality. You can let it slide, Officer. We're Even."
Everything else is great. I just... I don't know. I guess I don't like ketchup anymore. Wonder what else I don't like.,Roll over.
We need a tougher punishment.,Want to come over to the poopy side? Where are you two going Friday night?
Dinner at L'auberge.,You're lying.
"Um. Where are you going? My apartment's on the West Side. Excuse me. You need to go the other way. Hey, did you hear what I said? What the hell is going on here? What do you want?",An autographed picture would be nice. Oh! And I'm also gonna save your life.
Just let me go. I won't press charges. Forget the whole thing.,"That's pRobably true, seeing as how you have a brain tumor."
You're that nut-job doctor that keeps calling my publicist.,"Actually, I'm the nut-job head of diagnostic medicine."
"I run Every day. I don't get headaches. I'm fine. So, if you don't mind!","Actually, I do mind. I don't care if you die. But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna nEver finds out he's the father of Marie's baby."
Help!,"Help! We're gonna need a wheelchair! here. Look, in the last month your average line reading has slowed from 2.1 seconds to 2.9. You're pausing more. Always at the same intervals ""ï¿½ Every sEven to nine words. Which means you're having trouble reading one side of the teleprompter. Which means a peripheral vision pRoblem. Which means a tumor in your occipital lobe. Just one test. If there's nothing wrong, I'll take you right back home."
Make it cab fare. I don't want you anywhere near my House.,"Uh, just put it in my spot."
So I just press this button Every time I see a light?,"It tells me where your blind spots are. So! the twins They're gonna turn out to be yours, aren't they."
I told you. I can't talk about that stuff.,"But you want to be done with this, right?"
"One's mine, one's Julio's.",I knew it. Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst. You got her after.
How can you watch that stuff?,'Cause it's awesome.
It's preposterous. Not one real moment since I've been on the show.,"As opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like! I can't think of any."
What's going on?,"Hospital is being inspected and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me. I just Parked a town car in an ambulance bay and, instead of ripping me one, Cuddy acted like she didn't know me. It's either an inspection or an aneurysm."
What's the test say?,"As I suspected, you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field."
Are you serious?,"No, it's a joke. Two guys go into a bar and one has significant losses in the upper right quadrant of his visual field. And the other one says, 'You're gonna need an MRI to confirm the type and location of the tumor.'"
That readout says his vision's fine.,"No, it doesn't."
You lied to me?,I kidnapped you. You're surprised that I lied to you? It just means that the symptoms are intermittent.
You kidnapped him?,It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.
It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.,Are you mocking me?
My back. My back is killing me.,Don't care. Busy.
Amber's damn mattress.,Well that sucks. Don't buy a new one.
Are you being sarcastic? Because we are buying one.,She's incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.
We're buying a mattress for us.,"Wow. I'm faster than you right now. It's all about her and whatEver hapless salesMan wanders into her sights. She's gonna lie, steal and trade your testes to get whatEver she wants. Hold on. I just gotta do something before he dials the second '1.' You're going to end up humiliated, holding her purse and going home to sleep on a new mattress you hate."
What the hell are you doing?,He needs an MRI.
He needs an MRI.,Give me one millimeter slices from the cortex down.
Any particular reason you decided to sedate a Patient for a procedure that's completely painless?,Guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.
"Yeah, on TV. It's Evan Greer. He's the main stud on House's soap. Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.",Increase the magnification on the occipital lobe. You watch because you like or because I like?
"I was unemployed. I ""ï¿½","Bzzt. Sorry. That's not an answer, that's an apology. If we're Ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud ""ï¿½"
"Occipital, frontal and temporal lobes are clean. So's the optic nerve. Definitely no tumors.",He's fine?
"Uh, what should we tell him?",See if you can talk him out of suing me.
Foot numbness has a huge differential.,It gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision pRoblems.
He already kidnapped and sedated a guy against his will. Makes sense he'd also do something to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.,But it doesn't make sense to include the symptom that he caused in a differential he's so desperate to solve.
Unless he didn't mean to cause it.,"Stick to the filing, sweetheart. Let the doctors do the doctoring. Either toxins or a vitamin deficiency ""ï¿½"
"I'm guessing when you drugged him, you didn't catch him and ease him to the floor. He could have pinched a nerve in his ankle when he fell. You need to run an EMG test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass.","Kutner, leave the room. Wait thirty minutes, come back and tell her the test was negative."
Is it okay if I use that time to do the test?,Get out of here.
The rest of them can help me with all this stuff.,They're busy. Which is really annoying because I wanted to be able to say they're busy for no other reason than to screw with you. Research.
Why don't you have Rico do it?,You can't tell me you didn't notice that pause.
She's nEver waking up.,"Ah, this is a whole new experience in super high def. I had no idea Marie wore an underwire."
What about the way he's holding that stethoscope? His thumb and forefinger are meeting at an odd angle.,Could be demylenation from toxic exposure.
"Yeah, excellent job so far. House, outside.",Keep watParkng. You'll nEver guess what Rico's got in that box.
You have an obsession with an actor or the character he plays. I feel for you. You need to work it out. But I need you to do it when the hospital's accreditation and my job are not on the line.,You want the star of the hottest daytime drama on TV to die in your hospital?
"No, I want you to cure him without committing any more felonies.",I can't do my job if you're going to tie my hands like that.
Fifty-one weeks out of the year I let you run around like a monkey in a banana factory. All I'm asking is that you tone it for a few days.,I want that TV.
We're not bargaining.,You want something. Either you're bargaining or you're begging.
Me keeping my job is good for you.,"Yes, but it's better for you. I just want us to be equally happy."
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment. Means the foot's a real symptom. Could be vitamin deficiency.,Or a toxin.
Or atherosclerosis.,Or a toxin.
Why is toxin a better idea?,Might not be. We'll know after I'm finished searParkng his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff. Gotta go. Need a decision.
You're not going to cut your own throat.,"Yeah, that sounds like me. Test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins and search the home."
Really. Just as long as I get to help you break it in.,Pack your Manhood on ice. Maybe the hospital can reattach it.
You were so wrong. She's letting me choose.,"""You choose""ï¿½ does not mean you choose."
"Really? Sounded like ""you choose.""ï¿½ I suppose it's possible she meant ""House is soooo, so wrong.""ï¿½","It's a trap. It means ""if you love me you'll buy the one I want.""ï¿½"
Amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.,People who do aggressive don't like to limit themselves. Could a leaky space heater cause vision pRoblems and numbness?
He'd of gotten better at the hospital. It's not a trap.,Did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?
"House, look, she's ""ï¿½",Gotta go.
"The gin bottles are all gifts from fans. Brock Sterling drinks it on the show but Evan doesn't drink at all. He's on this whole health kick right now. Fruits, nuts ""ï¿½ did you take those from his dressing room?","No. You're not going to marry Brock, are you? We've been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna."
Are you really a doctor.,"Glioblastoma. Need more proof? So, no toxins on the set, how about his regular life? Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?"
No. I've been out with him. He's as vanilla as they come.,"And by ""out""ï¿½ you mean!?"
"Well, I asked him on a date last month. We went out a few times but we weren't right for each other.",Too small or too large?
Is that medically relevant?,"I'm a doctor and it's relevant to me. So, yes."
We nEver got that far. We made out a while then he just said he should go home. He's a real gentleMan.,Now that'd be interesting.
Now that'd be interesting.,"He's impotent. Steady diet of sunflower seeds causes a B6 toxicity, which causes an autonomic disregulation, which causes a wood-free existence."
One bad night and a couple of sunflower seeds and he's got autonomic disregulation.,"It's more than just one. He can't Even remember the last time he was able to salute. It's cool, huh?"
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen and we didn't find anything at the House.,So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of his blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis.
Just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't.,And can you find out where that voice keeps coming from? And tell it to get out of my head.
Plasmapheresis has risks. We should have him spend the night in the sleep lab. See if he gets a reflex erection.,"Confirmation is for wimps and altar boys. We don't need to wait for a reflex. If he can't get engorged the way God intended, he can't get engorged."
I'm not showing him my boobs.,"Lack of response to your chest tells us nothing. Thirteen, show him! Where can I find a decent set of knockers around here?"
"Thus the word ""atypical.""ï¿½","In that case, it could be an atypical bunion."
"Could be Graves Disease. Extreme hyperthyroid disease leads to systemic pRoblems including numbness, vision loss and cardiac arrest.",You want to be here.
I have to be here.,Just say the word. I'll fire Thirteen.
Just sign the forms.,Smart move. I was bluffing. She's right. We should fry the thyroid before it fries him.
"Uh! I know it's more exciting this way, but shouldn't we confirm you're right before destroying one of the most important glands in his body?","If that gland has drawn a bulls eye on his heart, then no."
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer. Protocol says we should do an iodine uptake test.,"""We?""ï¿½ Anyone else want to run a useless test while Brock's thyroid plots its next lethal move? It was rhetorical."
House is right.,"Seriously? I mean, I am, but you think so?"
What are you doing here?,Just grabbing a snack.
You keep food in the morgue?,"Well, if I keep it in the lounge, Everyone else eats it."
That's 'cause it's Everyone else's food.,Oh. I thought it was just Everyone else's bags.
The accreditation board will light us on fire for this.,"They're not going to find out. Unless, of course, Conway planned on inspecting the morgue in, say! two minutes. Is that why you're here?"
You're going to get me fired over a sandwich?,No. Over a TV. And you're not gonna get fired because you're gonna fold.
"No, I won't.","But you're gonna push it. So we need a safe word. So you can signal your unconditional surrender. Call me ""Sweet Sauce.""ï¿½ Dr. House. I don't think we've met."
Dr. Jaime Conway. I've heard your name.,"Most people have. It's also a noun. I sometimes come down here to relax, unwind. Maybe grab a ""ï¿½"
Sweet Sauce.,It's a nickname.
An ironic nickname. Wow. It is almost two. Aren't you supposed to be!,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. 'Cause those sick, blind kids aren't going to read to themselves. See ya. I recommend skipping C-26. Floater. Been in the river at least a week."
Thanks for the warning.,Any time.
Doesn't the doctors' lounge have that same TV?,"Nope. They've got a 12 inch, exactly like the one that used to be in here."
Files are done.,I'll be doing a dance of joy just as soon as my leg is healed. Can you tilt that down?
"I know the paperwork annoys you, but Patient records are important. You can't just let them sit there.","I had to. In the name of science. I let the crap pile up and I see which team member is the most self-flagellating ""ï¿½ breaks down, clears up the mess. Surprise was, it turned out to be you. Again. And you weren't Even registered as a competitor. You miss me."
You miss me. You hired Thirteen to replace me.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. All pretty girls are fungible. You're avoiding."
I miss the job. I miss running around playing private investigator. I miss... the puzzles.,"Seriously. I'll fire Thirteen. Or Kutner, if you think Thirteen is hot."
His kidneys are failing.,I told you to nuke his thyroid.
It's a good thing we didn't. Kidney failure means it wasn't graves.,"So, your test screwed me and our Patient's kidneys. You practically poisoned him with iodine."
Which he could have handled easily if his kidneys were healthy. All we did was rEveal a new symptom. Usually you're all for that.,Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that's put me off.
You were wrong.,So tell me to my face. You nEver hesitated before. The Board's turned you into a coward.
I did it because it was the right thing to do.,You did it to pass an inspection.
Does it matter? Kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition which means that any of his other organs could be next. We've already started dialysis. We need to run ANAs for autoimmune.,"You're right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings."
Excuse me?,Accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling. Make sure we're in compliance.
There's nothing in our office that would be less than!,I don't mean us. I mean the whole hospital.
Have you met me? I can take care of me. I need you to take care of you. I have work to do.,You made it to page 8. Mysterious hospital visit for soap doc.
"Wow. I'll be sure to send my Mom a copy. They told me I have an autoimmune disease, like lupus or sarcoidosis.",That's what we're here to find out.
You really as good as Everyone seems to think you are?,Are you really as miserable as Everyone seems to think you are?
I just want to do something that matters.,"Nothing matters. We're all just cockroaches, wilDebeests dying on the river bank. Nothing we do has any lasting meaning."
And you think I'm miserable.,"If you're unhappy on the plane, jump out of it."
I want to but! I can't.,Mmm. That's the pRoblem with metaphors. They need interpretation. Jumping out of a plane is stupid.
"Well, what if I'm not in a plane? What if I'm just in a place I don't want to be?","That's the other pRoblem with metaphors. Yes, what if you're actually on an ice cream truck and outside are candy and flowers and virgins. You're on a plane! We're all on planes. Life is dangerous and compliCated and! it's a long way down."
So you're afraid of change?,"No, you're afraid to change. You'd rather imagine that you can escape instead of actually try. 'Cause if you fail, then you got nothing. So you'll give up the chance of something real so you can hold onto hope. The thing is, hope is for sissies.'"
"When I get out of here, I'm not gonna be afraid anymore. I mean, how Many guys get a second chance?",Too Many. Half the people I save don't deserve a second chance.
And to your other sister.,You realize you're reciting lines from last season?
We're gonna do all the things I promised. Just help me get out of this bed.,Cooling blankets in here. This guy's brain is about to boil. Do you know where you are? What's your name?
We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics but he's slipped from delirium into a coma.,"Good news is the last time Brock was in a coma, he fathered two Parkldren."
Unless it's a fungus. We could see that under a microscope.,"Test him for fungi, parasites, all creatures great and small."
Where are you going?,To lie down. I need to think.
To lie down. I need to think.,Could be rat bite fEver. But his glands aren't swollen. Which one are you gonna get?
She told me to get the one I want.,"So get it. Listeria explains the sepsis, possibly also the heart pRoblem."
But not the numbness.,If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis which then caused the numbness.
I want a waterbed.,Wow.
I've always wanted one. I know it's ridiculous. It's just! There's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water. No mocking? No Freudian analysis of how the waterbed is really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?,I'm ignoring you because you make me sad. He's on ampicillin. Which means if it's listeria he would have shown some improvement.
"No. It's a whole! thing. You need special sheets and insurance and ""ï¿½",Who cares? You wanted one your whole life. You're a grown up. You can afford it. Stores sell them.
"Most adults don't go through life the way you do, House, indulging our Every whim.",You don't deserve to be happy.
And yet I am. You?,"It is stupid. Live the dream, Wilson."
"It is stupid. Live the dream, Wilson.",It's not an infection. It's an allergy. That's why it's not responding to antibiotics.
"This isn't a soap opera, House. People don't just wake up from comas the second you give them drugs.",Especially if we give them the wrong drugs. What'd the tests say?
"It was negative for fungus and parasites. But that doesn't mean""ï¿½","The more infections we rule out, the more likely it is that it's not an infection."
"He has no history of allergies or asthma. Most importantly, none of his symptoms remotely resemble an allergic reaction.",Allergens could trigger an allergic vasculitis. That would explain the symptoms.
One in a million times. Septic infection always explains his symptoms.,But an infection is nEver resistant to Every antibiotic.
"An infection is rarely resistant ""ï¿½",And allergy nEver responds to antibiotics. NEver beats rarely. QED I won. There were chrysanthemums in his dressing room.
My God. Why didn't you say he'd been exposed to plant life.,"Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrins, a neurotoxin and a know allergen."
"He has an infection. If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.","He has an allergy. If we don't give him steroids, we'll kill him."
Not as fast.,Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.
Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.,A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone.
Patients' names?,It's one Patient.
You want to give one Patient a hundred milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.,Perfect. The Patient's in a '69 Ford Coma.
"Anything over 50 milligrams, I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy. It's protocol. And the inspector's here.","I am 99% certain that she'll consent. For the sake of the 1%, why don't I just!"
You're not allowed back here.,"Well, tell the inspector he can put it on my tab."
100 milligrams of methylprednisilone is an overdose.,We were wrong about the infection. He's suffering from a sEvere allergic reaction.
"The team hasn't finished the test for allergy. His symptoms don't ""ï¿½","In rare cases! Trust me. At the end of this conversation, I'm right."
Then confirm it. Get a blood test.,What is it about this sEvere and deepening coma that makes you think we got time for protocol?
Protocol has saved your Patient from having his thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.,"If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong. Don't talk about protocol."
My job's on the line. You're job is on the line.,"Okay. Here's what you do. You wait three minutes, then you call security. By the time they get here and lock me up, I'll be done. He gets to live and your ass gets to be covered."
He was still right. It was an allergy.,To what?
Thank you.,I was wrong. You should have stopped me.
Hello?,Don't hang up. What was the verdict?
"$200,000 fine.",You should have been fired.
"Good night, House.",There are bubbles in his glass.
"Can't this wait until ""ï¿½",My Patient is allergic to quinine.
And you got this from bubbles?,The symptoms started two months ago. It's also when Brock started downing gin and tonics like a Brit staving off malaria. The gin was fake. The tonic was real.
And tonic water is loaded with quinine. Huh. Nice job.,You should've been fired.
I'm taking back the TV.,I saved his life.
That wasn't the deal.,The contract clearly stated no takesy backsides.
"Good night, House.",What are you wearing.
"Good night, House.","Good night, Cuddy."
Do you like that?,Uh...I don't know.
Do you want me to use my butt again?,I don't know how I got here. How Many drinks did I have?
Your scotch hasn't Even arrived yet.,That means I was drunk when I got here. 8:50. I remember being at work. I've lost at least four hours. Say five words.
What do you mean?,That's four words. The accepted diagnostic test for global memory impairment is five random words.
Are you okay?,I'm... Trying to find that out. Give me five... Animals.
Um...Cat. Bird. Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.,"Monkey, Rhino... Either I'm massively drunk ""ï¿½"
"Oh, you're bleeding.",Or it's someone else's blood. Do you see a wound? How bad is it?
It's all over.,"I have a concussion. Retrograde amnesia. I have no keys, no phone. I've been mugged."
No you haven't. You already gave me a twenty.,Did you earn it?
Not yet.,Someone is going to die.
Kenny!,"Not you. I saw something, a symptom. Someone is going to die unless I find them."
Who?,I have no idea. Keep the change.
I have no idea. Keep the change.,I saw somebody dying.
You saw thirty people flying into glass and metal.,I saw a symptom before the crash.
"You're concussed. You don't know what you saw and you don't know when you saw it. A week ago, you noticed a symptom in a soap star.",Bad argument. Since I was right about that.
That's all of it. A few stitches will hold your brain in place.,Ow!
Hey! Hold your head still unless you want me to sew your nose under your eye.,Why was I taking the bus?
Because you were drunk.,What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?
You okay?,Perfect. Uh...Uh...You. Get histories from Everyone in here.
Did you just forget his name?,No. Lesbian. Find out if anybody on that bus was taken to other hospitals.
You just forgot mine.,"No, Thirteen. I just wanted to call you a lesbian."
I'm not a lesbian.,"I was rounding up, from 50%. Find my cane and motorcycle. Figure out where I went last night."
Where's your cane and motorcycle? And where'd you go last night?,You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything.
You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything.,How much bigger could it get?
"You don't think it's ""ï¿½ A little weird that there's both a giant crash and a simultaneous, mysterious symptom sighting?",What if it's not a coincidence?
You mean like the hand of God reaParkng down and screwing with you?,That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?
That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?,"Right here. Purpura on Ralph Klamden's neck, indicative of leukaemia. Caused a bleed in the brain, and hence the accident."
I have leukaemia?,"No, we just ruled that out, pay attention. He pRobably had a seizure."
I didn't have a seizure. I got hit by a garbage truck.,Which you drove into while you were seizing.
You saw the bus driver exhibiting the initial stages of a seizure and didn't bother telling him to pull over?,Hey! Nobody leaves here until I say they can be discharged.
"She said I was ""ï¿½",Is she me? You have a fEver.
98.6.,I need him to stay.
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.,Stiff neck. This Man has meningitis. We need to quarantine the whole ER. No one leaves here until their full workup is complete.
You left here at 5:23 p.m. Your motorcycle nEver made it home.,"Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can't remember. Where else did you look?"
The other eight were taken over to Princeton General.,It would be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.
"Twenty-something year-old Jane Doe. Kidney contusion, laceration on her leg ""ï¿½",Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.
The weirdest thing we've got is a ruptured spleen.,"Okay, new plan. We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site. Find out where I went, we go there ""ï¿½"
On it.,"You're not going to do anything, are you?"
We're going to go to the ER and do our jobs.,"Someone is dying because I can't remember ""ï¿½"
"Medical hypnosis can bring the brain to a class II theta state, increasing focus and memory retrieval.","You're not doing to make me do the Parkcken dance, are you?"
Just relax. Keep letting go of any intrusive thoughts.,"So what, you saw an ad on the back of a comic book?"
Wilson is done talking now. Visualize the bus. The way it looked. The way it smelled. The people on it. What they look like.,This is a waste of... Time. Cool.
Focus on the details.,The bus is empty.
Shh. Just focus. Clear your mind. Think back to how you felt. Details you saw.,"I can't see out the windows, and I can see you guys."
"Why did you get so drunk at five in the afternoon, alone?","I need a reason? God, I hate 'beer' brand beer."
He...,"I can be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis."
What are you running away from?,"When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this Patient?"
Do you see anyone in the bar?,I see a faceless crowd. How do I focus? Say something to make me focus.
He's concerned about you. Why does that mean he's insecure?,Will you get your girlfriend out of here?
Amber's there? You've got Amber in your head?,You put her in my head. I can't Even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.
Well she better have her clothes on.,Unfortunately. I didn't mean to say that out loud.
Say what out loud?,I didn't say it out loud? Nothing.
What's going on in there?,"If I can't lie, I need these two out of here."
"Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber for now, shall we?","I wish it were that ""ï¿½ That's some program they got down there in Melbourne. Cheers. I remember the Bartender."
Good. Now you're accessing your temporal lobe. Does the Bartender have any odd symptoms?,He seems fine. Anybody here sick? Anyone here taking the bus?
You are.,Because... You took my keys.
Good. This is good. Now we can retrace your steps. Let's go back to the bus. What's in front of you?,Passengers.
"Anything, special about them?",Some emo guitar hero wannabe.
"You're focusing on him, why?",Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.
Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.,You a nose picker?
Do I have to answer?,"If the answer was no, you would have answered. Tilt your head back."
"He's fine. He doesn't Even have meningitis, just like Everybody else we've had to give meningitis shots to. You can go.",You have a brain tumour.
"You're kidding, right?","If I was kidding, I'd be dressed like you."
You're fine. A nurse will sign you out.,Go home. Have fun. Relax. I'm pRobably just a nut case.
Tilt your head back.,You can get your things and go.
Oh! Oh! I can't get up. I can't move my legs.,Your legs are not your biggest pRoblem. Your biggest pRoblem is... I don't know what your biggest pRoblem is.
Your legs are not your biggest pRoblem. Your biggest pRoblem is... I don't know what your biggest pRoblem is.,"So, we have the who, but not the what."
We've only got one symptom to go on. Sudden onset paralysis.,We actually have two symptoms.
Guillain-Barrï¿½ fits.,I'm just trying to figure out what Guillain-Barrï¿½ looks like.
You can't just eliminate Everything because it doesn't match what you might have seen.,How about because it doesn't match what I could have seen? Guillain-Barrï¿½ has no external physical Manifestations.
Where are you going?,"To smell a bus, obviously."
Why are you smelling the passengers' clothes?,Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory. I need to get back on that bus.
Okay. So why are you taking so much Vicodin?,"If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory."
"You split your head open, you should rest. Anything?",A hint of... Exploded bus.
"House, that's four Vicodin in forty seconds. At this rate...",Wish me luck. I'm going in. Rambo style.
"House, do you think this is going to work, or are you just stoned?","Both, apparently."
You're wrong. It's not working.,"So, you're saying I'm not here."
"If this were a real memory, you'd be limping. And you wouldn't be talking to me. I'm obviously a hallucination.",Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,We're both in my head. You'd think one of us would have noticed the blood.
Why haven't you had a head CT yet?,Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?
Dumb question. The brain's too fried during a seizure to form memories.,"Dumb answer. I wasn't asking you, I was asking me. Because you've already proven that you're not here."
I'm getting a headache.,Is that a clue?
He can't. The hallucination is your messed up brain's way of reasoning out a pRoblem.,You weren't on the bus.
How do you know?,Five hundred dollar shoes. Not on a Princeton cross-town.
Must be another reason why I'm here.,Yes. What do you have to tell me? I was talking to the passengers on the bus!
Stop fidgeting.,"If you haven't found the bleed yet, it can't be ""ï¿½"
"There's edema, and localized swelling in the section of the temporal lobe that controls short-term memory. Also, the penis size cortex is set to pathetic. What didn't you say out loud?",Very little.
"When you were under hypnosis, you were talking to Amber?",I wanted to see her naked.
"Seriously, what were you hiding?",I want to see her naked.
You want to see Everyone naked. Why would you hide that?,"Well some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends. But if you're okay, I've got a digital video camera. So we could ""ï¿½"
"Why would I be upset that you're treating my girlfriend like you treat Every other Woman on the planet, unless...You're not? Unless it's deeper than that. You WEREN'T objectifying her.","Trust me. I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend."
It's a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone.,I banged my head.
This isn't just a boo-boo.,I'll rest once I've figured out what's wrong with this guy.
"Why? Why this guy? You want Patients with weird undiagnosed symptoms? You get five files like that on your desk Every morning and you'd nEver risk your life for them. Why is this guy so special, so that you become BatMan?",I don't know.
It's two in the morning. You should be home resting what's left of your bruised brain.,Recovery's too fast.
It's my stomach. Oh...,Which means it's not transverse myelitis.
Rapid onset. It could be a perforated ulcer.,"Wouldn't explain the paralysis. Addison's, from a tumour. It's possible that I saw his eyelids droop."
We've scanned his head five times. You're bleeding.,A little thing called a bus crash. It's just a scalp laceration. It could be hidden in his optic Parkasm.
It's coming from your ear. You think that's a good thing?,But that would have affected his eyesight. I need to take a bath.
"Hallucinations and smells were kind of working, right? Why the bath?",Hypnosis gave me a nose picker. Smells set off hallucinations. Sensory deprivation should get the brain into an alpha-theta phase. Didn't you see Altered States?
I don't think I was Even born when that movie was out.,Well then you're too young to be a doctor. That movie was released in 1980.
That was twenty-eight years ago.,"No, it wasn't, shut up."
Did you just forget what year it is?,No. I just remembered how old I am. I need to give my brain time to transition so I can embrace my inner monkey. Or maybe I don't. Give me some physostigmine. It crosses the blood-brain barrier.
"And act like a nerve gas, stop your heart, you'll go to heaven and be omniscient. Good idea. Not going to happen.","Don't do anything. Even if I escape. Eat a goat. Get shot by police ""ï¿½"
I didn't know you rode the bus.,"I used to drive home after getting drunk, but some mothers got MAD-D. What are you doing here? You weren't on the bus with me."
Then I guess this isn't a memory. It's a fantasy.,"If it's a fantasy, you'd be wearing... This."
"You're convinced your Patient is dying, and you want to waste your time with a sex fantasy?",Don't blame me. Blame my gender.
"Well, I'm not here to indulge that. I'm here to help you figure out what symptom you saw. Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see ""ï¿½",Why can't you do both?
"Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see was him sitting down. Most likely facing forward.","From behind, I saw his earlobes wiggling. Or his head bobbing. But not that."
Could indiCate aortic insufficiency.,Marfan's syndrome.
Or syphilis.,What if his earlobes were just drooping?
Ehlers-Danlos?,Or cutis laxa.
It's not fatal in adults.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's an adult, very good point. Keep going."
I'm distracting you.,"No! Dance, Woman!"
You'd rather be diagnosing.,I screamed no.
"Hey, over here. Remember me? I'm the sick guy.",Tell me what I saw.
Was it the blood dripping from my ear?,That doesn't make sense. Because your shirt wasn't stained. And because that was me.
"I could have had a subtle hemiballismus, indicating the early stages of Huntington's.",Huntington's wouldn't explain the abdominal pain. And it's only on the table because we're thinking of Thirteen.
A shuffling gait could suggest Parkinson's.,Except there's no such thing as shuffling sitting.
He moved when he helped the old lady up the steps.,Who are you?
I'm the answer. Look.,At what?
Here.,You were right.
Help him up.,I got it! It's Parkinson's.
House. Your ear.,Start him on levodopa.
House!,Get that out of my face.
Welcome back. I'm Nurse Dickerson.,I don't need your name. And I got your profession from your super competent technique of melting my retinas.
Verbal faculties seem to be intact. Do you remember passing out?,I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes. Ow.
Yeah. Skull fractures tend to hurt.,It'd hurt a lot less if you didn't swipe my pain pills.
"Dr. Cuddy's orders. Wants me to regulate the amount ""ï¿½","Wait a second, you brought muscle?"
Dr. Cuddy's orders.,"Means I was wrong. My Patient doesn't have Parkinson's. Cuddy knows that's the only reason I wouldn't want to stay here with my pain pills, porn, and you forEver."
"Thank you. But Wilson's wouldn't explain ""ï¿½ Foreman.",How did you eliminate Parkinson's?
"Well, the tests confirmed the abdominal pain was caused by liver failure.",I assume you've already ruled out hepatitis and Wilson's.
Give him five minutes. Brainstorming a few possibilities isn't going to explode his brain.,"Then if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting. What about hepatic fibrosis?"
It could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?
"Why doesn't it make sense? The bus driver's Asian, his potassium is slightly low ""ï¿½","If he got paralysed while driving the bus, don't you think I would have gotten off at the next stop?"
Not if the next stop was at a 90 degree angle into an SUV.,"The bus would have slowed, I would have noticed ""ï¿½"
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms. There's no downside to testing.,Genetic test is too slow. Run the bagel test!
Yeah?,"So the carbo-loading marathon isn't working. Stop looking around suspiciously. To answer your next two questions, no, I am not there, and yes, you are completely predictable. If the test had worked, you would have called to put my deliCate brain at ease."
I told you not to lock the door.,Still wiping! Put the phone up to bus driver's grill.
Who are you talking to?,My large colon. TPP is not consistent with your Patient's laboured breathing.
Did you take my cell phone?,My large colon did. I'm negotiating its release.
Help!,What's happening?
The test worked. He collapsed.,"You're half right. He's wheezing, isn't he?"
Yeah.,You can't wheeze without moving your chest muscles. This isn't TPP.
Then what is it?,Well how am I supposed to know? I'm not there!
It must be a pulmonary embolism.,So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?
I asked him back in.,At the tail end of me Patiently explaining how you idiots were idiots.
We pushed tPA ten minutes ago.,That means it's not a clot.
Get him to the OR to suck it out.,Must have just screwed up the intubation. Seal's good.
"It's a clot, House.","Wait, wait. Look at his teeth. He's got shiny new caps. He's had recent dental surgery."
House!,House! Oh. Get a syringe.
I didn't bring you back here so you could stage a coup!,"Listen to me. Dental air drill pushed an air bubble into his gums. Dislodged while he was driving, and caused a myoclonic jerk. That's what I must have seen. Then it hit his spine, his liver, and now his lungs."
"Dr. Hadley, open the door.","I'm not plumping his pillows here. I'm putting him in the Trendelenburg position to move the bubble to the apex of his heart so you can suck it out, now get the damn syringe."
I can't risk you stabbing him in the heart looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.,Stab him.
Dr. Hadley!,See? She doesn't Even know your name. Stab his heart!
Sat's at 75.,"Yes, he's suffocating."
"If you're wrong ""ï¿½","Shut up and make a decision. You keep standing there, he's dead either way."
Open that door.,Don't shoot!
The O2 sats. There was an air bubble. He's okay.,The other nurse always used to tuck me in.
I'll be on the couch. With a shotgun in my lap.,Worrying about me?
Making sure you don't try and make a limp for the border. Get some sleep.,"I'm not sleepy, Mummy."
Me neither.,Who are you? And why are you stalking me?
"Technically, you're stalking me.",What is that? Mosquito?
Maybe just a fly.,In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.
In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.,Is this significant? Or is this dream just going in a different direction now?
I guess that depends. What are you going to do with that?,I have to tie this around you.
I'm cold.,Stay with me. Why did I say that?
Stay with me. Why did I say that?,Hey.
Go away.,It's not over. I saved the wrong person.
It's not over. I saved the wrong person.,"This wasn't just a dream or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland."
So the bus driver with the air bubble was just a coincidence?,Nope. I got the causation flipped. The bubble didn't cause the crash. The crash caused the bubble to dislodge. There was no myoclonic jerk. I saw something else in someone else.
You're not leaving.,What's the most dangerous thing a Patient could do when his brain is on the brink of herniating?
"Elevated heart rate, BP... Which is exactly why you need to stop.","Instead of sleeping, I'm going to be pacing around this apartment trying to decipher those visions."
Why does this matter so much?,I don't know. Heart rate?
127,BP? Contextual memory. I need to get back on that bus with all 31 passengers to remember who and what I saw.
I'm not going to call in crash victims because you've gone insane.,Maybe I don't need the actual victims.
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.,"Who's playing Anne McKeehan? Right here. Jane Doe #2 from Princeton General. Right here. You two, that's right. Goth kid. Yeah. At the back on the right. Yeah. Here. Okay..."
You think that staring at pictures on our shirts is going to be more effective than hypnosis?,"Well, if only you'd stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex."
Are you okay? What'd you see?,It just slipped away.
Is that Vicodin?,Nope. Just a little memory pick-me-up.
Are you crazy? Alzheimer's drugs will make your brain go into overdrive.,That's the point. It'll speed up my neuronal firing. Turn up the voltage on my memory.
And blow out your heart. How Many did you take?,Just now? Or including the ones I took on the ride over?
House.,Why are you here?
You beliEve in reason above all else. There must be a reason.,You have something to tell me.
Yes. Who am I?,"That's asking, not telling. Who are you?"
You know who I am.,"If I did, I'd be passed out in bed instead of OD'ing on physostigmine on the 6th Street cross-town."
What's my necklace made of?,Resin.
Who am I?,I don't know. Why the guessing game?
Because you don't know the answer.,"And if I don't, you don't. But you know the clues."
I know what's bugging your subconscious. What's my necklace made of?,No.
Who am I?,Doesn't make sense.
What's my necklace made of?,Amber.
Amber.,I have to tie this around you.
I'm cold.,Stay with me. Just stay with me.
You idiot! Your heart stopped.,Amber.
What?,Amber. It was Amber. She was on the bus.
"You almost kill yourself, and all we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.",Have you spoken to her?
She's pRobably working. She's... She's been on call. I called her... She didn't call... I... I... How could she...,I don't know... Jane Doe #2.
Female. Late twenties. Kidney damage. Does Amber have a birthmark on her right shoulder blade?,She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.
Previously on House.,I don't know how I got here. I saw a symptom before the crash.
I don't know how I got here. I saw a symptom before the crash.,Why was I taking the bus?
Taxing an already injured brain.,Someone is dying because I can't remember.
Someone is dying because I can't remember.,It was Amber.
It was Amber.,She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.
Her heart won't stop racing. No idea what's causing it.,Sure it wasn't the bus that landed on her?
"Oh, my God.",Delayed reaction to the trauma. She lost both her kidneys in the bus crash. She ripped up her femoral artery.
"We fixed the artery, got her on dialysis for the kidneys. WhatEver's doing this to her heart, it isn't from the crash.",Check her potassium?
She's been under the whole time. She had no ID.,Pushed adenosine?
"And verapamil, and floated the swan an hour ago.",Coronary angiography?
Three critical Patients ahead of her. We'll have her in within the hour.,We're fifteen minutes away from Princeton Plainsboro by ambulance.
You wanna move her? Her heart rate is a hundred and thirty.,She's hemodynamically stable. We're moving her.
You're not her doctor. You can't make that decision.,Her husband can.
Her husband can.,Right?
Move her.,If the trauma didn't damage her heart...
Why was she on the bus?,"I don't know. If she had any underlying condition, the accident could have exacerbated it."
Why were you with her?,I don't know! I'm not hiding anything. I just don't remember. What else could damage her heart?
I don't know! I'm not hiding anything. I just don't remember. What else could damage her heart?,"Wilson, don't get lost! I'm barely coherent. I need your help right now."
"Wilson, don't get lost! I'm barely coherent. I need your help right now.",V-fib!
V-fib!,Charging.
Okay. Okay.,Clear.
"Wait, wait, wait! Protective hypothermia.",You wanna freeze her? Her heart's not beating.
"Her heart's already damaged. If you restart it, it'll keep racing, shoot off free radicals, and kill her brain. We ice her down, put her on bypass until you've diagnosed her.",This is not a solution. All you're doing is pressing pause.
Please.,Cold saline solution.
Why are we doing this?,Bought us time to think.
Bought us time to think.,The trauma must have stimulated a pre-existing heart condition.
"Autoimmune congenital anomaly, blood clotting disorder, lead poisoning...","Great! Let's explore that. Quick, get her on panacea."
"EKG, nope. Heart's in the off position. Thallium uptake scan? Useless on a cold heart.","Yeah, we get it. Her heart's not beating. It's gonna make it harder to diagnose. On the other hand, she's not gonna die while you're whining about it. What else?"
Why not cyanide? He's a mess. He needs to sleep.,"I had a heart attack this morning. Can't do any more drugs till lunch. Get her an angiogram. Could show damage Even in a stopped heart. Rest of you search her apartment. Toxins, heavy metals, drugs, anything that might make her heart race."
I need to know if there's anything medically relevant that you couldn't share publicly.,Is this a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?
You were obviously drinking last night. Maybe you took Amber to a bar.,I left here on my motorcycle alone.
You ended up drunk on a bus together. Maybe you met Amber in the bar.,I was not having an affair with her.
You can't really say that if you don't remember.,"I lost four hours, not four months."
Are you okay?,"Can't really say ""yes"" when it's a hallucination asking."
"Don't worry, you're just dreaming.",What symptom did I see in you? A myoclonic jerk...
Boring.,An incredibly rare neurological symptom is boring? Am I in someone else's subconscious?
What did we do last night?,Was I meeting you for a drink?
Do I feel familiar? What do you feel? Electricity.,Electricity.
Electricity.,I know I saw the symptom. I know the memory's locked in my brain. Now I know how to get it.
No.,You don't Even know what I'm talking about.
You need to rest. I have yet to hear about any study linking electricity and rest.,Deep brain stimulation. It's been proven. Electrical impulses applied directly to the hypothalamus could evoke detailed memories.
Amber. Amber. It's me.,Random spikes are common.
It's gonna be okay. I'm here with you.,The team has found something. Can you ask her if we can be excused?
The team has found something. Can you ask her if we can be excused?,What?
Sh-she'd have to be an addict to take enough for it to damage her heart. I'd know.,Did you know that she was hiding them in her vitamins?
"No, we've been over this. Starting her heart could cause brain damage, could burn out the heart muscle.","Test her heart without starting it. Crack her chest open, reach a finger inside the pulmonary vein, run it across the valve."
That's the safer course?,It is if we're wrong.
If this were any other Patient...,"If the valve is calcified, that's our answer. That's our cure. Go."
"If the valve is calcified, that's our answer. That's our cure. Go.","""Thirteen"". Who found the diet pills?"
"""Thirteen"". Who found the diet pills?","You didn't Even go in the bathroom, did you? You're suddenly mute in the differentials. A blow-up doll would be more useful. And yes, that's the first time I've Ever implied something negative about a blow-up doll."
"You didn't Even go in the bathroom, did you? You're suddenly mute in the differentials. A blow-up doll would be more useful. And yes, that's the first time I've Ever implied something negative about a blow-up doll.","Normally, I'd be fascinated. Today, don't care. Get over whatEver it is and do your job."
"We can stick a needle in her liver. If we see fibrosis, she's right.",Does Amber drink sherry?
"And the cardio fits just as well. But there's no way we can tell, since we can't take her temperature.","I had a dream. She was pouring me a glass. And since I'm a scotch-, beer-, gin-, and rum-Man..."
"I know you love her and, uh, you're scared she's gonna die. But just making her colder and colder isn't a cure. It's not dealing with the reality.",Sherry means something.
Amber doesn't Even drink sherry. House. Can we get back...?,"If she did drink sherry, it would mean nothing. Since she doesn't, my subconscious is obviously trying to make some other point."
"A coaster with ""Sharrie's Bar "". A glass of scotch is placed on it, by the Bartender.]",Wilson's right. We need to make her colder.
Putting more ice on her is just delaying the diagnosis.,"Not on, in. Fill in her lungs with slurry."
Where are you going?,Taking Wilson out for a drink.
Is this the place?,Maybe.
... for these.,Did you see me here with a-a tall blonde Woman?
"Yeah, I think she joined you after scotch number sEven.",Did she seem sick?
She sneezed. I gave her a napkin.,Did you see the color of the sputum?
"I assume sputum means snot. Look, I see a lot of drunk Parkcks in here. I didn't have time to stop and analyze the color of your girlfriend's boogers.","She's not my girlfriend, genius."
"Last night, she was your girlfriend.",Blood in the sputum could mean parasites. Any recent travel?
You seemed into her?,"If he had a brain, he wouldn't be tending bar."
"If he had a brain, he wouldn't be tending bar.",Sneezing's a new symptom. Let's assume the runny nose means an infection.
"I was six years old. I used to like helping out in my parents' store after school. Guy walks in to Rob the place. Ends up shooting them both. Wasn't fair. Took years, but I had to accept that's just the way it was. So you gonna help me fill her lungs up or not?","Tell me that the liver biopsy showed infiltrates, minor inflammation."
Yeah. How...?,"Snot on a napkin. Add the heart, infiltrates..."
Hep B.,Start her on IV interferon. I'll go tell Wilson.
Hepatitis B is a lame diagnosis.,"Oh, God. I get less rest when I'm asleep."
"I rise from the dead, and that's the reaction I get?","I'm sorry. If I had known, I would have started a breakaway Jewish sect. Hep B fits."
"I'm sorry. If I had known, I would have started a breakaway Jewish sect. Hep B fits.",Why are you doing that?
Because Hep B doesn't fit.,Turn her over.
We're about to start a second course of interferon.,Which she might not need once you turn her over. Small of her back.
She's bruised. Why is that significant?,Look closer.
A rash. How'd you know what was on the small of her back?,"Either I'm still asleep, or I'm starting to remember."
Dermatomyositis.,Wouldn't speed up her heart.
Wouldn't speed up her heart.,"Yes, the symptom that I saw on the bus was a rare interferon allergy that flares up two days before you take it."
How did you see the rash down there?,I don't know. Maybe she leaned over.
Maybe it's not a rash at all. It could be an abscess.,"""Thirteen"", stick a needle in there. If there's pus, Foreman's right."
"""Thirteen"", stick a needle in there. If there's pus, Foreman's right.","I'm not asking you to stick a needle all the way through. Taub, you do it."
"I'm not asking you to stick a needle all the way through. Taub, you do it.","No, apparently, you can't!"
It's treatable. Doxycycline.,"Allow eight hours for the antibiotics to take effect, then we warm her up, shock her heart."
We're nEver one hundred percent certain.,"Run the blood cultures. After we get confirmation, then we'll restart her heart."
He's wrong. And you know he's wrong. You can't change your mind just because a family member starts crying. They're always scared.,"I said, run the blood cultures."
"I said, run the blood cultures.",Sorry. Wide stance.
Sorry. Wide stance.,Why are you screwing up?
Why are you screwing up?,Did you hate her?
Did you hate her?,"'S not guilt. That just leaves fear. Young Woman dying. Young doctor dying, in fact. That sound familiar?"
"'S not guilt. That just leaves fear. Young Woman dying. Young doctor dying, in fact. That sound familiar?",By not getting tested? Dealing with it by not dealing with it. It's clearly working beautifully.
By not getting tested? Dealing with it by not dealing with it. It's clearly working beautifully.,My grandson gave me a mug that says that. Okay. Enough hand-holding. Deal with it. Get back in there. Or pack up your stuff.
This was not your decision to make! You went behind my back. You went behind House's back.,Inside voices.
"Heart, liver, rash, and now her brain.","Autoimmune fits best. Crash trauma could've set it off. Start her on prednisone, then we'll warm her up again."
You can't do this.,That's not a good argument. It's not an argument at all. I'm sorry.
"Cuddy's right. I was afraid to do anything. I thought if Everything just stopped, it would be okay.",And it's gonna be. Taub's starting the treatment. We're doing Everything...
Not Everything. Before you warm her up... You said you wanted to try deep brain stimulation.,"But there's no reason. We know the symptom, we know what I saw."
What if it's not the rash? What if you noticed the rash in the ambulance or when we were putting her on bypass? What if there is still something else stuck inside your head?,You think I should risk my life to save Amber's.
Inserting the IPG pRobe into your ventral hypothalamus. Give me three volts.,Can't hear him.
Can't hear who?,Everything's in black and white.
Who was talking? Is Amber there?,"You're supposed to be jolting my hypothalamus, not petting it."
We don't want to overload it.,"As long as I'm risking my life, I might as well be watParkng a talkie."
You're not getting them back.,"Hey! You take my keys, you gotta give me a phone call."
Who are you calling?,Dial-A-Wilson.
Amber was home.,I told her to find you. Have you pick me up.
I told her to find you. Have you pick me up.,I said to find Wilson.
Does she seem sick?,Not yet.
C'mon. Time to go.,Whoa. Need another round! And a drink for... what passes for a lady around here? What's your poison?
Nothing. We're leaving.,"We're leaving, leaving, leaving, leaving... Cosmos. I remember Wilson buying cranberry juice. I'll have another. And she'll have a Cosmopolitan."
The obstinate drunk thing is not flattering. C'mon. You called for a ride.,"Drink your drink, or I'll drink 'em both."
Let's go.,Hey! We need another Cosmo here.
Hey! We need another Cosmo here.,She sneezed.
Thanks.,Looks like snot. Seems like a cold.
Nothing else?,No.
Where are you going?,Think I paid?
"House, what are you doing? You can barely walk.",Go home. I'll take the bus.
"Hey, someone's gotta pay for this.",Hi.
You forgot something.,"You don't give up, do you?"
"Yeah, I'm an idiot that way.",You doing this for me or for Wilson?
For Wilson.,"Well, then it's Even more impressive. Salut."
"Ugh, damn, do you have a Kleenex?","I got a sleEve. I got two, actually."
Is that it? The flu? Is there any rare complication?,"No. It would explain the rash, but nothing else. Unless..."
What?,Don't do it.
Don't do it.,It wasn't the flu. It's what she did for it. She has aMantadine poisoning.
What? What's wrong?,AMantadine binds with proteins. Dialysis can't clear it out of the blood.
AMantadine binds with proteins. Dialysis can't clear it out of the blood.,There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.,I'm so sorry.
Amber.,Amber.
Still non-responsive.,You're dead.
Everybody dies.,Am I dead?
Not yet.,Should be.
Why?,"Because life shouldn't be random. Because lonely, misanthropic drug addicts should die in bus crashes, and young do-gooders in love, who get dragged out of their apartment in the middle of the night, should walk away clean."
Self-pity isn't like you.,"No, well, I'm branParkng out from self-loathing and self-destruction. Wilson is gonna hate me."
You kind of deserve it.,He's my best friend.
What now?,I could stay here with you.
Get off the bus.,I can't.
Why not?,Because... because it doesn't hurt here. I let it... I don't wanna be in pain. I don't wanna be miserable. And I don't want him to hate me.
You can't go in there.,"Who are you, and why are you wearing a tie?"
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant. Can I tell her what it's regarding?,Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.
"I'm her assistant, not her secretary. I graduated from Rutgers.","Hmm. I didn't know they had a secretarial school. Well, I hope you took some classes in sexual harassment law. Does the word ""ka-Parkng""ï¿½ mean anything to you? I'm going in now."
"Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.",What's with hiring a male secretary? JDate not working out?
He is cute. Be careful.,She's not like you. She can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.
"I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a ""ï¿½",You met me at a strip club.
If you have a pRoblem working with Stacy you should have said so.,What was I supposed to do? Ask her to leave? That's just rude. Death row guy. I want the case.
How do you Even know about him? You don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.,"No, but ""partypants""ï¿½ does."
You stole my password?,Hardly counts as stealing; it's a pretty obvious choice.
"Well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.","Nolo? Well, I don't want to say anything bad about another doctor, but! especially a useless drunk!"
You are addicted to pain pills.,But I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm talking over.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.,"Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual options for why a guy's heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood. Wait a second ""ï¿½ there are no usual options!"
How badly do you want this?,I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
"Just the heart, or the Patient have any other complaints?",The Patient's not talking to anybody.
Where are we going?,You are going to the clinic for two hours.
Me? Why?,"Talk to Cuddy. She's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences unit, I don't know."
Aren't there better ways to spend our time?,Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a Man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a Man who kills his wife?
"Uh! yeah. Actually, he is.","What about a Parkld molester? Certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody. Maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs. What about you? What medical care should you be denied for being a car thief? Tell you what: the three of you work out a list of what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed. I'll review it when I get back."
"Your Patient shanked one inmate his first month here, broke another one's neck, nearly decapitated one of my guards!","Relax, I've got a great bedside Manner."
"Too dangerous to House him in the infirmary. You don't have to worry, we've taken Every precaution. I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paperclips and staplers. Any supplies that might be used as a weapon. Open her up! For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.","And yet, you're staying out there."
All she has is a cough.,"Bluish tinge to the fingernails, lips! he's hypoxic."
What's that mean?,"It means he's not getting enough oxygen. You know how people say you can't live without love? Well, oxygen's Even more important. He's got fluid in his lungs, breathing rate of 50! he needs to be intubated and put on a respirator."
Don't have a respirator.,"Better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him."
I'll make out a requisition. The state's already sentenced this Man to die.,"I think the state was a tad more specific about ""how""ï¿½. This is Dr. Gregory House. I need an ambulance to pick-up at Mercer State Prison."
"Wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate. No way a Death Row inmate leaves my prison, at least not through the front doors.",You work fast.
So do you.,Was that a shot?
"Yeah. It was easy once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markem, she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.","Stop, I'm getting turned on."
House!,Ruh-row!
It was just a consult! You expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?!,Did you do something to your hair?
"You said you cleared with her ""ï¿½",Come on. You've known me how long and you still don't know when I'm joshin' ya?
Take him back to prison. Now.,"No, can't. See, ironically I'm bound by this court order which your ace attorney got. I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him. Is it just me, or is that weird? Anyway, we're walking."
"No, can't. See, ironically I'm bound by this court order which your ace attorney got. I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him. Is it just me, or is that weird? Anyway, we're walking.",Somebody left this on my chair. It's clEver. Forces me to either deal with the file or nEver sit down again.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.,"You shouldn't have told her that. She's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, six months, tops."
Have you Even looked at the x-ray?,"No, just guessing. It's a new game. If I'm wrong, she gets a stuffed bear."
A spot on a x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.,I love Parkldren. So filled with hope.
It could be pneumonia. It could be sarcodosis.,"Could be, if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung."
"Could we at least brainstorm for other ideas? Thank you. I still think it could be pneumonia and sarcodosis, but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure. The five stages of dying.","Exactly. Personally, I think it's all just new-age crap, but from your tear-filled, puppy-dog eyes I think I've made my point. Now go tell Cindy WhatEver-her-name-is that she's dying. Tachycardia, pulmonary edema, likely suspects?"
The Death Row guy? That's who you're working on instead of Cindy?,"God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush. By dying, I meant no matter what we do. Very, very soon she is going to be dead. Is it still to subtle?"
I took an oath to do no harm.,"Yeah, well, it's not like they make you sign it or anything."
"We cure your Patient, he goes back to Death Row. He goes back to Death Row, they kill him!","He stays here and we don't treat him, he dies, and I still don't treat Cindy Lou-Who."
Can we get on with this?,"Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie."
"Exactly, I'm black. I sympathize for guys who grew up in the city kept down by the Man.",Makes sense to me.
Are you serious?,"The Man knows prisons. When we've got a yachting question, we'll come to you. Okay, drugs it is. Test his hair, blood, urine, the works."
Water! water.,What's the differential for being thirsty?
"Blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system.",Don't do that.
"What, you have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?","Nope. Only I get to write on the board. So it's not drugs. What else can cause the heart to do wind sprints? You got the blood work back, any ""ï¿½ ""ï¿½ thing out of the ordinary?"
His bi-carb is low.,"Yeah, but which column? Could be the result of the tachycardia, could be the cause?"
It's the cause.,"Why, because you want it to be? Let's see how well that works with your other Patient."
We're just talking seMantics here. We should put him on a bi-carb drip and send him back.,"Right, buff his numbers. Don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause. I thought you cared about Patients."
"Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap, our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to Death Row.","Our job is to diagnose him. What? Mommy and Daddy are having a little fight, it doesn't mean we stop loving you. Now, go outside and play. Get Daddy some smokes and an arterial blood gas test. Wow. That was impressive. Okay, what number am I thinking of?"
"Were you trying to get me fired? If you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?","I just don't want you working right here, in my office. But anywhere else in the building is fine. It's a big hospital."
I'm a Lawyer. You're a jerk. There's gonna to be some overlap.,"God, I hope that was a euphemism."
Cuddy just reamed me.,I hope that one means what I think it means.
For trusting you! She figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.,"The number was six, by the way."
"I need to know, can I trust you?","If I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my Patient would be dead."
Blood gas came back with a pH of 7.28 and decreased HCO3.,"Which means two things. Most importantly, Cameron was wrong about the bi-carb, and less significantly, we have a new symptom. Anion gap acidosis. Who's chubby? Come on, pretend he loves puppies. Pretend he's a huMan being. What've you got?"
"What if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?","What ""something else""ï¿½ could lead to anion gap acidosis?"
Mudpiles.,"Well, you don't have to ask. Just wash your hands before you come back."
"Methanol, uremia, diabetes!","Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too."
"Paraldehyde, INH, lactic acid ""ï¿½",Rewind.
INH?,Yahtzee!
Nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.,"ClEver entrepreneur like Foreman here, chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin."
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.,Who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash?
"Fine, I'll do it.","Great, Chase it is."
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable?,You've got a prettier mouth. Better chance the inmates will open up to you.
The Man's in a coma.,He didn't mind. I asked.
You're getting crumbs all over him.,"Why do you think they put TVs in coma Patients' rooms, anyway?"
Some people think they can still hear.,So leave them a radio. His eyes are closed; who thinks they can see?
Do you know why people are nice to other people?,"Oh, I know this one. Because people are good, decent and caring. Either that, or people are cowards. If I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me. Mutually assured destruction."
Exactly. You're gonna eat these Parkps?,You gonna get to your point?
You need people to like you.,I don't care if people like me.
"!Yes. But you need people to like you because you need people. Unless you think you can get the next court order yourself. If Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her. And that's not Even dealing with the greater agenda ""ï¿½ of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.","Look I know you're friends with her, but there is a code. Bros before hos, Man. Crap."
What is it?,Death Row guy is dying.
"Bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30, it's not going to hold that much longer.","Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?"
Temporary fix?,Right. Don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin. They're just gonna have to have to take more.
"Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours! We don't Even know what's wrong with him ""ï¿½",Just get out of here.
This is Chase.,Did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
I haven't spoken to any inmates.,Does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I've decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.,I appreciate your candor. Did you Even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo?
"I'm searParkng both Clarence's cells. I figure, if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.",Unless he finished it.
"Yeah, that'd be a shame. He could have shoved it anywhere, there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands",Call it off. Come on back.
What's going on?,You're dying. A Man deserves a last drink.
You're okay.,Thanks. That means a lot.
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country. We're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.,Thought you convicts knew how to drink. You're at least three shots behind. Now you're four shots behind.
"House ""ï¿½ I was just waiting for test results, I was!",Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
Oof. That's the finest piece I've seen in ten years.,I could've hit that.
And you didn't.,Eh.
Then you're the one that should be locked up.,"Tell me something, I've been trying to figure this out. Why does a guy ""ï¿½ ""ï¿½ who's on Death Row suddenly try to off himself? I know you drank that copier fluid. It's not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it'll do the trick."
"It just hit me all of a sudden. It was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, Everything. I had to take control of something, right? When to die, I figured that was as good as anything.",And that thought just came to you. Just like that.
"Man, I told you. Twenty-three hours a ""ï¿½","Mmm. Well, look. Here's the good news. The copier fluid you drank contains about 90% methanol, which is very poisonous and you took more than enough to kill yourself. The bad news is the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it's gonna bind with that nasty formic acid raging through your body, and you're just gonna pee it out. Harmlessly."
"Man, you are drunk.","Yes, I am. I also saved your life. At least for now."
Morning! Your head hurt?,"No, you just have a very grating voice."
You always were a light weight.,Why are you talking to me?
"Can't it be enough that I want to cause you pain? The Patient's okay now, you're going to send him back?",Absolutely. Can I trust you?
You used to.,"I still think the Patient's sick. I'm keeping him here. Now, either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed, or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed and buy me some time."
With contrast?,"She's done Everything she needs to do except tell her Patient that she's dying. I told you, only I get to play with the markers. Our prisoner has a new symptom."
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.,I'm not buying that CLARENCE is trying to take control of his life by suicide. Healthy people don't kill themselves.
Healthy people don't kill other people.,Guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.
"What if it wasn't suicide? What if it was an escape plan? Drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here?","Excellent. Explains Everything, except the symptom that got him here. His heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini. I think there's something going on in his head. Check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases! do a CT, LP, full workup. State's paying, so go nuts."
"You killed four people. Somehow, making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.",Oh no. Now you've left your entire body in my chair. What does that mean you want?
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.,I take it the CT with contrast came back.
They're not definitive.,Biopsy would be.
Biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.,"And definitive. But you don't want definitive, you want to hang on to your delusions as long as you can."
A lavage could prove it's not cancer.,But you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch. The answer is no.
"Why? Because it's me? I'm over you. I've jumped on the bandwagon. I hate you, okay?",Great. Let's treat her.
"What is it? You won't help Cindy but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt! Are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, that all that matters is your stupid puzzle? Fine. Treat them the same. That's all I'm asking. One test.","Wow, that is remarkable. According to those patchouli-oli selling new-agers, it's supposed to be the terminal Patient, but you're going through the five stages. You just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining. Cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure."
Your Death Row guy's still here!,"Yeah, sorry. Just gotta get him stabilized. PRobably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes."
Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.,"Figuring requires deductive reasoning. I'm figuring that you did no figuring. Stacy just ratted me out, right? So much for attorney-client privledge."
"I'm the client, you moron. Stacy has a duty to this hospital.",Right.
I'm sending him back to prison.,"Whoa, can't. Court order."
Would you describe it as a shooting pain? A thRobbing pain? Or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?,Where does it hurt?
"My gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed!","Well, he'd know. Let me take a look."
"Oh, so Everybody lies except a convicted murderer.","I don't think he's faking this stuff. What do you think, Doctor?"
I didn't have any choice.,"No, you had to tell Cuddy. She's your boss, I get it. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too."
"Yeah, pretty much on that same lEvel.","Gandhi didn't march the sea because his buddies asked him too, Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends."
You're not making friends right now.,I trusted you.
I know.,Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.
I had to do what I thought was right.,It's the only reason anybody does anything.
The surgery went fine. They removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel. They're shackling him and taking him to recovery.,I wonder. I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate.
"Fine, I'll bite. What the hell are you talking about?",Everything we do is dictated by motive. Why did he kill his girlfriend?
Because he's a Maniac!,Is that the reason he gave?
She was cheating on him.,"Jealousy. That gets him sent to prison, where he kills inmate number one. Why?"
Guy attacked him first.,REvenge. Who'd he killed after that?
Prison guard.,Who had a file full of abusive complaints. PRobably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.,"Call that one ""retribution""ï¿½. Then he kills inmate number two. Anybody know why? Nuh-uh. It's not in there."
All of a sudden I got to have a reason?,"It's an anomaly. Doctors love anomalies. Dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI!. Killing that second inmate is the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine. It doesn't fit. I'm interested in things that don't fit. Tell me why you did it. Your other victims you were almost bragging about. What was different about this guy?"
"It happened when I was in gen-pop. I was in the library, just readin', and I started feelin' real nervous. This guy was staring at me, I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck, it made me feel crazy. Sweat was pouring down my face. I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears. I just raged out on the dude.",So what's the differential for raging out?
"Adrenaline ""ï¿½",Prep Clarence for surgery.
Care to share with the class.,"Oh, come on. Do I have to spell it out for you? Pheochromocytoma. Actually, I'm not sure how you spell it. But you said it yourself, adrenaline. Pheochomocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff. It's perfect, it explains Everything. The tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel ""ï¿½"
But pheo's extremely rare.,I love rare. Set up an MRI. Where's Cameron? Like I don't know.
Pheo what?,"I don't Even remember. It's just a fancy way of saying small, adrenaline-secreting tumor. Yeah, that clarified it for you. All you need to know is if I'm right, we can fix it. Just gotta to find it first. We need an MRI. It's completely painless for most people."
But not for me?,I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI's basically a giant magnet. It'd suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.
I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI's basically a giant magnet. It'd suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.,Stop squirming. Don't make us do this again. Big baby.
Turn it off!,"There's Waldo. Found it, Clarence."
Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!,Keep him in there until you guys see it too.
Looks like they got the pheo out successfully. So what now?,Clarence goes back to Death Row.
Just like that?,He's cured.
"That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.","My God, you're right! Let's call the surgeons, we've got to save that tumor. Put it on the witness stand."
We could testify at Clarence's appeal.,"You smell that? I think that is the stink of hypocrisy. You wouldn't Even consider the notion that Clarence's social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you're sprinting to the witness stand to blame Everything on a little tumor."
A person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.,"Yeah. See, you only overcame one of them. Well, let's just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm? Which, is pRobably going to piss off all those other pheo sufferers who Managed to control their rage attacks and become Lawyers, race car doctors, or Even doctors. Removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots adrenaline, it doesn't absolve him."
You want him to be executed?,That's not what I'm saying.
Got an opinion?,Everyone's got an opinion.
"I, um, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.",You'll do what you think is right. On your own time.
House! Need you.,"Uh uh, forget it. I'm going home."
Hay fEver?,"Boy, you must be a doctor and Everything!"
Two minutes.,"No, the purple thingy on the file means that ""whoEver""ï¿½ is one of yours, which means cancer, which means no way is it two minutes."
"Fine, I'm lying. 30 minutes.",Mystery of life.
Benadryl might help.,I already did 1000 milligrams.
Steam room?,Why Jimmy. We'll talk about this in the morning.
I've got a nine year old with cancer. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose.,Not yet.
She's hallucinating.,So the Rhabdo's in her brain. Make her comfortable she's got about a week.
"Yeah except there is no cancer in her brain. Pristine CT scan, blood tests, protein markers all negative.",The cancer's in remission? Which means the hallucinations are unconnected.
Fascinating huh? And not that it matters but if you fix whatEver's going on in her head you give her maybe another year. Long time for a nine year old.,No. It'll just fly by.
If it was me I'd just stay home and watch TV or something. Not lie here under a microscope.,"Don't worry, anything happens to you nobody's is going to lift a finger. Differential diagnosis on your marks, get set!"
Hallucinations could be caused by!,Whoa. Wait for it! and go.
"No, nothing on mom. Dad split when she was pregnant his medical history is also clean.",What a guy.
Blood work and LP were clean.,But where there's infection there's meningial swelling.
That CT shows no meningial involvement.,True. Get a tox screen and MRI.
We can do that if you want to ignore what we just discussed.,Sounds good.
Toxic exposure doesn't make chronological sense.,"Yes, there is a third option ï¿½ she's making it all up because she doesn't want to get in trouble for breaking a mirror. Unfortunately we can't test for that so! Tox screen, MRI and you stay away from the Patient."
What'd I do?,"Oh well, you'd just get all warm and cuddly around the dying girl and insinuate yourself; end up in a custody battle. Chase you handle the mom. Tell her that you'd just sit home and watch TV and die, but you're going to go though the motions of trying to save her daughters life. It's a doctor thing. What the hell is this?"
Black walnut and ginger.,It's nice.
A pro. I like it.,Whoa look at the time I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.
You've only been here 20 minutes.,Can't slip anything by you can I.
There's a Patient in one.,I'm taking a sick day.
Take some Claritin.,Everyone's a doctor suddenly.
"Balls are in your court, Doctor.",Union rules. I can't check out this guy's seeping gonorrhea this close to lunch.
Exam room one.,Well it's sexist and a very dangerous precedent; if people could choose the sex of their doctors you gals would be out of business.
Exam room one.,"Sore throat? Well it's not lupus. Well not Everyone can operate a zipper; the up, the down. What comes next?"
My new girlfriend nEver been with a guy who wasn't c-circumcised so she freaked andï¿½,"Aha, and you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht. I get it it's a shandah."
I got some box cutters and uh!,Just like Abraham did it.
"I sterilized them which, uh, I was told you're!",Stop talking. I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.
"House. Hey, House. Andie's MRI and tox screen were clean. No infection. No neurotoxins.","Oxygen saturation is 94%, check her heart."
Her oxygen saturation is normal.,It's off by one percentage point.
It's within range. It's normal.,"If her DNA was off by one percentage point she'd be a dolphin. We've got a Patient, who for no obvious reason is hallucinating. Since it's not obvious, I thought we'd go with subtle."
But the lungs could lead us somewhere that is.,Welcome to the end of the thought process.
Could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis.,"I'm going home. While I'm resting you guys get some arterial blood gasses. Once you confirm she is hypoxic I want a plethysmography, Chest X-ray, CT and VQ. And if all that comes back negative then snake a catheter into her lungs. Don't worry, I don't sleep in. I'll get bagels."
What if it is? Please kiss me.,Bagels.
You didn't sleep in.,Didn't sleep. Didn't breathe. I'm dying.
Pulmonary angiogram of Andie's lungs was clean. Arterial blood gasses and a CT scan were also normal. Her heart and lungs are fine.,Which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage.
Yeah oddly enough sometimes normal is normal.,Sometime we can't see why normal isn't normal. Get her symptoms on the board.
Whoa; you're letting me touch the markers?,"It's written down in my advanced health care directive, should I be incapacitated in any way you run the board, then Foreman. Chase you're just not ready yet. What else?"
She's hiding it pretty well if there's any of that going on.,"Yeah, all girls who've been molested want to talk about it. Break out the rape kit."
She hasn't had sex.,Why are you so sure?
She told me she'd nEver kissed a boy.,You read her diary too?
She asked me to kiss her.,"I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein."
But she's not a regular nine year old. She's got terminal cancer.,Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand!
She wanted one kiss before she dies. If she's nEver kissed a boy it's a fair bet she's nEver had sex.,"Tell that to all the hookers who won't kiss me on the mouth. Hey, here's a theory, she has been molested, seeks refuge in roMantic fantasies with older men with great hair. And I think you left out the punch line, victims of molestation learn to work the angles. Manipulate people. You did it didn't you. You kissed her."
It wasn't sick. It was one kiss for a dying girl. One small! one small kiss before she dies. Thank you. Thanks.,This is exactly why you can't touch my markers. Go see if she's had sex.
With a Patient.,Is she dying?
No.,Then she can wait.
"Would you excuse me, just 2 minutes.",If only she'd been molested then we'd have something to go on. No forced entry.
"One hallucination; maybe it was just bad pork, maybe there's nothing!",She's not fine. Her sat percentage dropped another point.
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.,"Lung wouldn't explain the hallucination. CT scan showed both lungs were clean, which means there's a tumor in her heart."
Not a chance. Give me that.,I loosened it.
"I opened it. We've got an MRI and an echo of her heart, there's nothing there.",Give me one other explanation for low oxygen saturation.
I can't. There's only one condition that simultaneously affects the heart and the brain but she!,Perfect let's go with that.
Tuberous Sclerosis in a kid that also has Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Two different unrelated cancers at the same time is a statistical no no.,"What's the rate of cancer in the general population? 1 in 10,000?"
"Don't, don't start with the numbers.","The way I figure it 1 in 10,000 of them should have another cancer. Little girl won the lottery twice. It happens."
So you're gonna cut her open?,"Exploratory surgery, gotta find this thing."
You're just going to grope around inside an immuno-compromised nine year old? She could die on the table.,I know it's somewhere near the heart.
Why are we here?,Better acoustics. Now listen to this.
That's a mitral heart valve.,"No, get the wax out of your ears. This is the Patient's aortic valve. I downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram."
What are we trying to hear?,Tumor.
They tend to keep quiet on account of them not having any mouths.,"But we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve, which would indiCate the presence of something; a tumor for example. If we can tell the surgeon where to look this is no longer exploratory surgery it's a precision strike."
Her aortic valve sounds normal.,Too bad. Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve.
Normal.,And this is her mitral valve.
I don't hear anything weird.,You guys make me sad. Listen again.
She's had one hallucination. Why are we operating on her? Why are we risking her life?,Because Wilson thinks it'll be nice to give the girl a year to say good bye to her mommy. I guess maybe she stutters or something. Now shut up and listen. Tricuspid. Mitral. Again.
Wait. There. There's an extra flap.,"I'm gonna ask the surgeon to look at the mitral valve first. Chase, I want you there. I don't like reading surgeons reports, they're boring."
I'm not really sure I should be spending more time!,She'll be unconscious you'll be safe.
"Brave kid, she Even gave her mom a pep talk.",Sure. Brave. She's a wonder.
What's your pRoblem?,These cancer kids; you can't put them all on a pedestal. It's basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats.
You're unbelievable.,If there's not one yellow-belly in the group then being brave doesn't have any meaning.
Andie handles an impossible situation with grace. That's not to be admired?,You see grace because you wanna to see grace.
You don't see grace because you won't go anywhere near her.,Idolizing is pathological with you people. You see things to admire where there's nothing.
"Yeah, well, we're evil.",You find things to admire where you shouldn't be sniffing at all; like Debbie in accounting.
She's nice.,"You shouldn't know that, you're married."
"So the little kid dying of cancer, I shouldn't like her?",If you're dying suddenly Everybody loves you.
"You have a cane, nobody Even likes you.","I'm not terminal, merely pathetic; you wouldn't beliEve the crap people let me get away with."
She's got a bleed in her eye.,"They got the tumor, repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye."
She didn't bleed out of her eye from a heart tumor.,True. The cardiac tumor was benign.
That's impossible.,Statistically.
Oh shut up. If the tumor's benign that means it didn't cause her hallucinations.,That's why I'm mentioning it.
So the tumor is a coincidence.,This is bad you're starting to state the obvious.
"No, you said it would be there, it was there. It can't be a coincidence.",A nine year old with terminal cancer gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart why?
It's benign? That's impossible.,Talk to Wilson.
What's the theory here? This girl's body's a lemon? Faulty Manufacturing? Everything's falling apart.,"The tumor is Afghanistan the clot is Buffalo. Does that need more explanation? Ok the tumor is Al Qaeda. Big bad guy with brains. We went in and wiped it out but it had already sent out a splinter cell; a small team of low lEvel terrorists quietly living in some suburb of Buffalo, waiting to kill us all."
"Whoa, whoa, you're trying to say that the tumor threw a clot before we removed it.","It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest."
"It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.",Angio was clean.
There's no clot?,"There's a clot, we just can't find it."
We can't do exploratory surgery on her brain.,Are you sure you're not a neurologist?
"Okay, she's gonna die.",Well the clots not gonna to go away quietly. It could blow at anytime. Are you gonna let them know?
To tell Andie she's going to die? That's very un-you.,She's such a brave girl. I want to see how brave she is when you tell her she's gonna die.
Go to hell.,What would you do if you were told you were gonna die?
"I don't know, I'd be devastated.","You'd cry like a baby, Everybody would, but she's not doing anything. She's a rock."
She's brave.,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why?
She's gone through more than most people do in a lifetime.,So what? Does that mean she's ready to die? What if her bravery is a symptom? The clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions.
You think her bravery is chemically based.,Would tell us where to look for the clot. Where's the fears center?
The Amygdala near the hippocampus; it's a big area and a busy one. You blindly cut in there you'll kill her. The only time you're going to see this clot is at autopsy.,Then let's do that.
Then let's do that.,Is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a living person?
Are you high?,"If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted."
It's Wednesday.,I want to induce a hypothermic cardiac arrest. Once the Patients on bypass we siphon off two liters of blood then perfuse the brain while she's in an MRI.
You're actually talking about killing her.,"Just for a little while, I'll bring her right back."
"Oh, well, in that case go ahead. Why are we Even talking?","If we do nothing she's dead in a day, maybe a week; the kind that lasts."
We need FDA approval for any surgical technique that's used for diagnostic purposes.,"Absolutely. If we were doing anything invasive; but there's nothing invasive. Gah. You know, I'm not cutting into her head I'm just looking for a clot."
Not invasive? You're killing her.,"Don't split hairs, if it works she lives."
Make sure the mom understands that this is a million to one shot.,I'll see that Wilson passes that along.
Signed consent forms.,Great. Thanks.
You sound better.,"I stacked a combo of mentholatum, a few vicodin and something else which I can't remember. Should be able to ride the high for a couple hours; what did Andie say?"
About what?,About this.
I didn't talk to her; she doesn't need to know the specifics of this procedure.,What if you're right about her? What if she just is that brave?
That doesn't mean she's mature enough to handle this kind of decision.,Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.
Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.,I'm doctor House.
I've seen you around.,Did your mom tell you what we're gonna try?
Sorta.,"Tomorrow's test could take ten hours, in your present condition you might not Even make it through."
My mom's done a lot of research.,"How do you feel about it? If we figured maturity came from how much time you've got left instead how long you've been here, this would be your call."
I don't have a choice right?,I could give you one.
I wanna get better.,You've got cancer. I fix this!
I've got a year.,A year of this. A lot of people wouldn't want that. A lot of people would just want it to be over.
Are you asking if I want to die?,"Nobody wants to die. But you're going to. The question is how, how much you're gonna suffer and how long. I'm asking if you want this to be over."
What would you tell my mom?,I could give her ten excellent medical reasons why we can't do this procedure.
I can't just leave her cause I'm tired.,But you can't stay for her either.
But she needs me here.,"This is your life, you can't do this just for her."
I love her.,"Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal. Playing the part of Andie is Morty Randolph. For his donation to science we give our thanks. Once Andie is cool and goes off bypass we have 60 seconds to get 2 liters of blood out of her body and back into her for the pictures to find the clot in her head. IF our star is bumped tomorrow while my MRI is on these red lights will go off which will mean we have no useable test results. No test results; its goodbye Broadway. You guys will be wearing bad cat suits in Des Moines. Neurosurgeons here, with a view of the monitors. Cardiac surgeon there, in case we need to open her up.

How hard can this be?,Again!
Again!,Again!
Again!,Again!
We could bolt her to the table.,"Gruesome and low tech. Kiss me I love it. A five, six, sEven, eight!"
Here you go doctor.,This'll make you sleep.
A lot of people.,Big musical number kiddo; a lot of people here to make you look good.
He gets that sometimes.,Okay go.
Okay go.,Start the cooling. You. Go.
She's shivering.,200 milligrams of vecuronium.
200 milligrams of vecuronium.,What? She's dead; that's the whole idea. Go.
What? She's dead; that's the whole idea. Go.,Okay put the blood back in; reperfuse the circuit.
Okay put the blood back in; reperfuse the circuit.,Anything people? Anything at all?
Vestibulocolcular nerve intact.,Keep looking.
There!,I didn't see anything.
It was there.,Are you sure?
I saw it.,That's good enough for me.
You're treating your stuffy nose with cocaine?,Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine. New delivery system; it's a blood brain barrier thing.
It's all about speed isn't it? One thing to another; nEver standing still. You're pretty good at that.,I know my way around a razor blade.
It's time.,Just a couple more rocks.
Andie's going home.,"Right, parade of the small bald circus freaks. Sorry, I got a thing."
I read the surgeon's report.,Oh?
Clot was nowhere near her Amygdala. Means her fear emotions were working perfectly.,Yeah.
Yeah. So her bravery was not a symptom.,"Yeah. I was wrong; she genuinely is a self sacrificing saint whose life will bring her nothing but pain, which she will stoically withstand just so that her mom doesn't have to cry quite so soon. I'm beside myself with joy. Whoa!"
She enjoys life more than you do.,Right.
She stole that kiss from Chase. What have done lately?,I'm pacing myself; unlike her I have the luxury of time.
In case you want to see real butterflies.,I'm not gonna kiss you no matter what you say.
"It's sunny outside, you should go for a walk.",Not much for long walks in the Park. Now get.
Right leg?,Huh?
Your right leg? You can still ride. We've got excellent financing right now. It lists for 10-8 but I'll let you steal it out the door for 10-3.,No thanks. Could I test drive one of these things?
How does falling off your roof do that to a guy's fingers?,"Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar! Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture."
"Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar! Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture.","Could have pinged the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow. Or it could be"
"DIC.? Guy falls off a roof, the first thought is it's always a clotting pRoblem",Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes. Guy could loose more than his hand.
Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?,"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip"
Who?,You want to know his name? I'm sure it's in the file.
You want to know his name? I'm sure it's in the file.,"Or you could ask her. She's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together."
I'll get started on the blood tests.,"You haven't been a real doctor in ten years, you'll make a mess all over the sheet."
You have clinic duty. I still know how to handle a Patient.,Get me blood. Lots of blood.
Get me blood. Lots of blood.,They're better. They've showered.
"His PTT is prolonged, the fibrin split products are off, he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.","Well, obviously not that mild. This keeps up and his hand will literally be dead meat. His hand is connected to his arm, his arm is connected to!I'm not sure, but I bet it's important."
All this from falling off my roof!,"Yeah, if only he'd fallen on his head. Then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms."
We need something stronger than heparin. HuMan activated protein C.,"Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage. Protein C is indiCated only for sEvere sepsis."
"Well, how Many of his limbs have to be at stake, for it to be sEvere?","But this stuff is crazy dangerous. It can cause internal bleeding. If he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die."
He could get better.,"You know, if I tried a scheme like this, you'd give me that nasty, wrinkly face and screech like a hyena. It's very sexy, I admit."
Do it.,Protein C is border-line irresponsible. 'Cept that the safe stuff isn't doing squat.
This is exactly the type of thing you would do.,"Well, obviously."
You were just jerking Cuddy around?,You seriously thought I wanted to stop her?
One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.,"No, first causality of this case is her sense of humor."
"His fingers are Even darker, his temperature is 102 and spiking, and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.",The good news is he won't be bitParkng about losing his hand if he can't breathe.
The trauma from the fall could cause actuate respiratory distress syndrome.,"Right, I forgot. Your roof."
It would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fEver and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.,The only question is why?
Why what?,"Why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis formed entirely by personal guilt. Let's assume we've been wrong up until now. Let's assume, just for one second, that the earth doesn't revolve around Cuddy's roof. What if he was sick before he had his run-in with gravity? He just didn't notice anything."
Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.,"Sure, only pavement hits that fast. It's not pneumonia. Might have missed a finger turning dark, he's not going to miss breathing pRoblems. What else?"
It's pneumonia. He wanted to go home. I thought he was lying. I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.,"Well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?"
I thought it was just asthma.,"Might have mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing."
"If it's just garden-variety bacterial pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.",So give him garden-variety Levaquin and a garden-variety echo-cardiogram. And go check out the kid's House.
"The blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is, ifï¿½","If he's huffing nail polish, or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way will be faster. I bet Julio is just dying to find out what's wrong with him. . Go with her."
It's Alfredo. And I can handle getting a key andï¿½,Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what's important and what's not.
You Ever think about writing a book on office politics?,Trust me. It would be a lot worse if I told her you have to break into her House.
"Wait, wait, wait. Cuddy's House?","See, it is shocking. Guy's been working there Every day for the last three weeks. Do you think it's impossible that he could have picked something up?"
I'm not breaking into my boss's House.,I'm your boss.
She's scarier than you are.,"Oh, she's a Woman. Relax, I'm coming with."
"No, nothing wrong with that.",What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!
What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!,Twenty bucks says I can get through this door in twenty seconds.
So how did you know about her key? You been doing a little handyMan work for Cuddy yourself?,Someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy pRobably has three extra keys hidden within ten feet of the door.
"Oh, and you consider obsession a negative quality?","Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic."
"Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic.",I got the bedroom.
I got the bedroom.,This is where it all happens.
There's no way you deduced where that key was.,Does this count as red?
"You gave yourself twenty seconds, then put money on it.",Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.
Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.,Just you. It's like some kind of weird shrine.
You're kidding.,Yeah.
Yeah.,She uses super tampons. What does that mean?
You two are just too nasty to each other not to have been!nasty.,"Hey, I can be a jerk to people I haven't slept with. I am that good."
There's nothing here. Are you ready to go or you got some more stuff you want to sniff?,Whoa. Check this out. It's fuzzy. It's black. It's alive.
Patient's lung function is declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working. He obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.,I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.
Rats.,Scars on his hand!
Rat bites.,But he says they're from construction work so he won't have to admit he's got rats in the home. Catholics are right. Pride will kill you.
Rat bite fEver.,"Boogy, oggy, oogy."
It fits the symptoms perfectly.,It's certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
What sink?,You ought to clean your bathroom better.
You broke into my House?,"No, that would be wrong. I had a key."
Oh damn. You're right. The focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely.,"You're right I'm right. On the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible."
Yeah. Your point being?,Going the dangerous and aggressive route didn't work last time. It's bound to work this time. Start him on the amphotericin.
Bitch.,With a Patient.
Not according to the log.,It's three-fifteen.
How's Cuddy doing?,She's not acting like Cuddy. It's a pleasure.
"You know her. She has trouble with these situations, feels personally responsible.",Technical term is narcissism. You can't beliEve Everything is your fault unless you also beliEve you're all-powerful.
"Wow, doesn't she sound messed up.",I don't beliEve I can fix Everything. I don't lie awake at night tormented by that fact.
"No, you lie awake tormented byï¿½",We were talking about Cuddy here.
She cares.,She enjoys feeling guilty.
"Lisacares. It's why she drives you nuts. 'Cause it's not just a puzzle to her. The Patients are actually real, their feeling actually relevant. And I'm telling her, she can't Even talk to him.","My God, it's contagious. You're feeling guilty, too."
I'm just saying take it easy on her. You owe her that.,Commercial's over.
So glad we talked.,"Snap, crackle, pop. Got some Rice Crispies in there?"
"That bad, huh?","You were here yesterday. I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle. Got to give this stuff more than a day."
I didn't fill that Oreo's prescription.,"On the theory that you didn't trust him because he's black!well, I'm going to prescribe the same medicine. See if you fill it this time."
"I'm not buying into no racist drug, okay?","It's racist because it helps black people more than white people? Well, on behalf of my peeps, let me say, thanks for dying on principle for us."
"Look. My heart's red, your heart's red. And it don't make no sense to give us different drugs.","You know, I have found a difference. Admittedly, it's a limited sample, but it's my experience in the last ninety seconds that all black people are morons. Sorry, African-Americans."
I'll see another doctor.,Fine. Fine.
Fine. Fine.,I'll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.
Dying?,"Geez, it's the cops."
Muriendo? Mi hijo esta muriendo?,Guess she understands a little English.
Proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him.,That wasn't a complete waste of time. His reaction shows that you don't need to clean under your sink. It wasn't aspergilllus.
And blood cultures show he was negative for rat bite fEver.,There's still plenty of other cool pneumonias!
"No, his antigen is negative.","Well, that all sucks!"
DIC wouldn't cause a fEver this high.,See my lapdog agrees with me. How high?
"Two hours ago, it was one-oh-three. With acetaminophen.",What about on St. Alban's Day? Only temperature I'm interested in right now is his temperature right now.
"No te preocupes, descansa, yo voy a trabajar por ti esta noche. .",Open up.
"Te dije que no, y se acabo!","Okay, let me clarify. Open up and keep it open."
Okay.,Under your tongue.
Under your tongue.,You're using your left hand. Right one hurt?
"No, I feel better.",It really doesn't hurt? Or you just figure if you say no you'll get out of the hospital sooner?
Doesn't hurt. Feels good.,You don't smell too hot.
You don't smell too hot.,Your hand is starting to rot.
Your hand is starting to rot.,Why are we here?
We're talking about cutting off a kid's hand.,"Yes, we're talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos. It's not a legal issue."
Are you being intentionally dense?,Huh?
I've heard enough.,What? She says one word and you take her side. You should wait until she at least gives a medical reason. Otherwise I might take it personally.
All of his symptoms are caused by his underlying pRoblem and the medicine we gave him.,What underlying pRoblem? You have no idea what the underlying pRoblem is.
You're the diagnostician.,Fine. It's all my fault. Does that make you feel better?
His hand still has an arterial pulse.,His hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.
You are being pretty aggressive about destroying a Man's livelihood.,Don't give a damn about his livelihood.
"He lose that hand, he loses his job. All of his jobs. He's not like us.",He can't work as a cripple?
"He loses his home, his kid brother drops out!","American dream destroyed. Very sad, very emotional. Not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale. You've lost perspective, Cuddy. You've stopped looking at this as a doctor. You're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof. You want to make things right? Too bad. Nothing's Ever right."
"American dream destroyed. Very sad, very emotional. Not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale. You've lost perspective, Cuddy. You've stopped looking at this as a doctor. You're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof. You want to make things right? Too bad. Nothing's Ever right.","I'm happy to report that we're now so in synch we're actually wearing each other's underwear. Chop, chop time."
Is this true?,"No, I'm lying. Stupid to do with her in the room, I guess."
This is a big decision.,We made it.
We should convene in a meeting of the ethics committee.,NO! . Look. She is making a medical decision based on nEver wanting to feel regret. You're making a legal decision on wanting me to be wrong.
"Greg, you have a history of ""ï¿½","You wanted superficial agreement. You wanted Everybody's asses covered. You got it. Now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please?"
I gave one of my clinic Patients a follow up call. Your name came up.,I'm guessing an old black guy that thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.
He says you gave him the white folks' stuff. This is exactly why black people don't live as long.,This isn't about race. Unless annoying is a race. Is he not getting better?
He's fine so far. I'm calling him back in. I'm getting him on the right stuff.,"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is."
"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is.",I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.
He was right. You did exactly what white people do. You figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it. So you just lie to us.,It's just a white lie.
"Good one, Master.","Right, I'm a racist. Too bad that idiot will nEver know for the rest of his long, long life."
And dialysis.,"I'm getting distracted by the multi-system organ failure. Pinkies are supposed to be pink, right? They're not called grayies."
But the organ failure is gonna kill him.,But the pinky is weirder! What does it tell us?
Same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off. It's the same symptom.,"But at a different time. His blood work indiCates mild DIC. What if it's mild in the way you get out of the ocean, the water clinging to your body makes the sea lEvel drop. It's technically true, but completely irrelevant."
"Well, the lack of DIC would explain Everything if there were also a lack of anything to explain.",Endocarditis. His heart's infected.
Endocarditis. His heart's infected.,"Little bacteria cauliflowers clinging to his bowels. Except sometimes they can't hold on. They go swimming in his bloodstream. Thursday, one breaks off, goes to his right hand. Black fingers, gangrene. Friday's Parkld heads for the kidneys. We all know what Saturday's are all about. Party with the left hand. Also explains the fEver."
It's perfect. Except for the little fact that we're already tested for endocarditis and he was negative.,Which either means he is negative or what infection could cause pneumonia and culture negative for endocarditis? Prize value goes down with Every clue.
You're thinking psittacosis? Alfredo doesn't have any pet parrots.,Which are squawking. Give him doxycycline.
No! That will just make his clotting pRoblem worse.,"I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try. We give him the doxy now, damnit, maybe we can save his pinky. He can teach his brother how to count all the way to five."
"If you're wrong, he'll end up with no hands and no feet.","Technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end up dead. But I take your point. What's his night job?"
He cleans up at some fast food joint. Why? Do you think he got it from a Parkcken nugget?,Since when do fast food joints allow twelve-year-olds to mop floors?
Alfredo is twenty.,Really? Looks younger.
Where were you going to work tonight?,What job do you do on Saturday nights?
What are you doing?,Wake him up.
We just cut off his hand.,Yeah. We need to talk about it.
It's not happening.,Donde trabaja su hijo los sÃ¡bados por la noche?
Why didn't you say you spoke Spanish?,"Well, because, she'd want to talk to me."
"Well, because, she'd want to talk to me.",DÃ­game!
No trabaja los sÃ¡bados. Es la Ãºnica noche que descansa.,She says he doesn't work Saturday nights. Give me the talking juice.
The fact it doesn't fit your theory doesn't make it a lie.,"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight."
"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight.",Que hace Alfredo los sÃ¡bados por la noche?
"Se divierte con sus amigos, va a bailar!",Saturday nights he goes dancing. Either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.
Saturday nights he goes dancing. Either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.,A dÃ³nde?
Yo no se!,Give her the talking juice.
She doesn't know what you're talking about.,"Odds are, it's going to be close to his House. PRobably an abandoned wareHouse or factory. Take the Scooby gang and spread out."
What the hell are we looking for?,"Find somebody who looks like crap, tell him you want to place a bet."
Ah!,Sayonara!
It's Cuddy.,I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You're welcome.
I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You're welcome.,What do you think the record for one-handed juggling is?
You can yo-yo one-handed.,Good point.
I nEver figured it out at all.,Hello.
What do you want House?,"if you're wallowing in self loathing, I've got something that might help."
"if you're wallowing in self loathing, I've got something that might help.",We're getting sued.
We'll settle. He's got a stub where his hand used to be. We have insurance. Case seems pretty solid to me.,Ca-Parkng. The new American dream. Happy ending. Kid's gonna be just fine.
Ca-Parkng. The new American dream. Happy ending. Kid's gonna be just fine.,Cuddy.
Cuddy.,"Your guilt. It's perverse, and it makes you a crappy doctor. It also makes you okay at what you do."
You figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss?,"Now would the world be a better place if people nEver felt guilty? Makes sex better. Should have seen her in the last months of our relationship. Lot of guilt. Lot of screaming. I know this wasn't just because it was your roof. Cuddy!you see the world as it is and you see the world as it could be. What you don't see is what Everybody else sees. The giant, gaping chasm in between."
"House, I'm not naÃ¯ve. I realizeï¿½","If you did, you nEver would have hired me."
"If you did, you nEver would have hired me.",You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.
You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.,"By the way, why does Everybody think you and I had sex? Think there could be something to it? I don't know."
Cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis.,Think so?
There's no way she could have.,No. No way she could have.
No. No way she could have.,It's raining.
Sebastian? Call 911! Isn't someone here a doctor?,Selling subscriptions? I heard twenty and you get a new bike.
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.,Really? Crushed under the weight of his own ego?
Wow. Is there nobody you admire?,"Well, there was this gal I met in 'Nam who could blow out a candle without using her ""ï¿½"
He thinks it's TB.,Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.
He wants a second opinion.,Second to his own. Okay. It's not TB.
What is it?,"Oh, you want specifics?"
"No. He died last month. Stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin and they only had enough for one. Dr. House, I'm Sebastian Charles.",Patients aren't usually part of the diagnostic process.
"Every minute, four people die of TB.","Wow, how can you sleep at night?"
"There're people dying in Africa of a disease that we cured over ""ï¿½","Yeah, I know. I saw the concert. Seriously, let's say you sleep six hours; that means Every night you kill 1440 people. I guess you got to get some sleep, but come on, if you'd stayed up another 10 minutes you could have saved 40 lives. Do you send notes to the families in the morning? That's going to take at least ten minutes so that's another 40 dead, another 40 notes!. Why don't you go wrack yourself with guilt in your own room?"
"No, thanks, I'll stay. I'd like to hear the differential.","Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it's not a good idea for the Patient to be here."
He's an immunologist and a TB expert.,"That'll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words, ""I think it's TB.""ï¿½ What is that?"
"Oh that. I'm sorry, that's my body powder. It's the only thing I've found that works in the Sahara. I, I'm kind of used to it, I don't Even notice it.",Who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie?
It smells okay to me.,"That is exactly why the Patient shouldn't be in the room. If you can't tell a Man that his cologne makes you want to puke, how are you going to tell him that he's an idiot?"
He's not an idiot.,"Sure, you say that now, while he's in the room."
"Look, I don't have time for this. It's TB.",Nope. The symptoms are too varied.
"Well, if you haven't seen 10,000 cases I'd agree that's what you'd think.",Told you he's an idiot. You said you wanted a second opinion.
"No, actually. My backers wanted a second opinion.","Yeah, doesn't look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsor's logo."
"It's TB, and I'm not dying. I'm going to want you to plan a PPD and induce sputum to confirm the TB. Imaging studies will determine the progress, and I think we should pRobably take a CT-scan of my lungs just so that nobody second-guesses us?",Wouldn't want that.
I should go.,"The nameless poor have a face, and it's a pompous white Man."
What's the emergency?,"I can't remember how to do Walk the Dog. The guy's sick, he may be dying. We've forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis."
"You just sent us off to test him for ""ï¿½",I had to get him out of there. Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot. Who wants to go first?
He's right! Tuberculosis could present in hundreds of different ways!,"Well, by that logic, Everyone in the hospital should be treated."
Not Everyone in the hospital's been exposed to it for the last 20 years.,"TB takes years to kill you. Two weeks ago he was perfectly healthy, now he's got a white board full of symptoms."
What about something metabolic?,"Welcome aboard the Good Ship Asskisser. Nice day for a sail. Pucker up, me hearties."
What about his heart?,Obviously big as all out doors.
Abnormal heart rhythm. White form showed P-R variability.,"It's subtle, but it's there."
You think it's his heart? Sick sinus syndrome?,"Loose throttle. Sometimes beats too fast, sometimes too slow."
It would account for the episode. I'll put him on telemetry; do a stress test and an echocardiogram.,"Treat him like Every other hospital Patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown."
Good for you.,"Every minute that we refuse to love one another, another puppy cries another tear."
You're just mad that he's closer to a Nobel Prize than you are.,"And yet I've nailed more Swedish babes. Crazy, crazy world."
"It's not just a trip to Stockholm, you know. It comes with a cash prize.",Seriously? No wonder Everyone's going after that peace thing.
"He cures thousands of people Every year, you cure, what? 30?",McDonald's makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more?
"Oh, I see! So you hate him because the lives he saves aren't as good as the lives you save.","Yup, that's the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won't accept his blood money."
The top of my head's killing me.,Hmmm. We spent a week doing 'top of head' in Anatomy. I know just where it is.
Ow! That is not the top of my head!,"Eh, close enough for clinic. Your sinuses are clogged. Judging by the scratches on your hands, I'm guessing a new cat."
It was my mother's. She's dead.,You keep a dead cat?
No. My mother's dead.,"Oh. Poor cat. You're allergic. We can control it with antihistamine, one pill a day."
Pills?,You don't like to swallow. Not surprised. Forget the pills. I'll give you a nasal spray.
Steroids? Is there something else you can give me?,"Well, if you lived by the river, I've got a bag."
"Hey, stress test was normal.",But his EKG was not normal.
Echo's normal.,"Two for you, one for me. We need a tie-breaker."
Echo and stress test are more reliable.,Tilt-table test.
NEver works.,Bet you a week's clinic duty it does.
"Hah hah, you're on.",You like this guy?
You always tell us our opinion of the Patient is irrelevant.,"Medically, it's irrelevant. That says something about you."
You figure that anybody that gives a crap about people in Africa must be full of it?,"Yes. There's an evolutionary imperative why we give a crap about our family and friends. And there's an evolutionary imperative why we don't give a crap about anybody else. If we loved all people indiscriminately, we couldn't function."
"Hmmm. So, the great huManitarian's as selfish as the rest of us.",Just not as honest about it.
"You also always tell us motives are irrelevant. Dr. Charles, your heart's handling the changes in orientation just fine. No pauses on your EKG. And House drives up for the lay-up and oh, rejected!",What does this knobby thing do?
I'm within protocol range; you're not going to get a different result.,"The way I figure it is, if this could show you pRoblems at 6, imagine what could happen if you crank it to10."
"House, is that you?",Does it go to 11?
"Okay, I'm getting dizzy, I can't see, I'm gonna pass out.",I win.
"At those speeds, astronauts throw up.",I'm not talking about the nausea.
You were wrong.,"Hey, I have feelings. I'm trying my best. Isn't that enough for you?"
It's not sick sinus syndrome.,"Well, thank God we found out before we put the pacemaker in. And thank God you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing."
Why would you say he's selfish?,Because he's been talking to Foreman.
"No I haven't, I'm just giving my opinion. This kind of altruism doesn't just naturally ""ï¿½",Excellent briefing.
"Hey, the guy's still sick. Can we talk about that? The headaches point to a neurological pRoblem. Acoustic neuroma. Brian tumour causes dizziness, loss of consciousness, messes with breathing patterns, heart rhythms ""ï¿½","Get an MRI. Hello? Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right down. No pRoblem, I'll do an extra hour to make up. I'm late for my clinic duty. Here, go be me for a couple hours."
"Yeah, there is.",Did I ask you to plant a PPD?
"It was positive, he's got TB!","Well, of course he's got TB! The guy's been in the jungle for 20 years! If he tested positive for pink-eye would you think that was his big pRoblem?"
"I did a test, it was positive, why is that a pRoblem?","Because now he's got the big red target on his arm, the stubborn jerk thinks he's right! He won't let us do any more tests."
"Well, maybe he's not the only stubborn jerk. I did an LP2: low glucose and he has an increased sed rate. Everything screams tuberculosis!",Not Everything!
If any of the symptoms are caused by the TB it would throw off our diagnosis.,You're right. Got to treat the TB.
"Who knows, maybe he'll just get better.","You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
"So it's TB, but not TB?",I'm compliCated.
"The guy does know tuberculosis. If he says it can Manifest itself ""ï¿½","He's not Even a real doctor, he's a huMan telethon."
"Is that your pRoblem with him? You see hypocrites Every day, why is this guy so special?",You think I have a hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy? The pRoblem is there are 26 letters in the alphabet and he only uses two of them. He treats thousands of Patients with one diagnosis. He knows the answer going in. It's cheating.
So it's all because he's one of them useless specialists?,"Oh, did I hurt the big time oncologist's itty bitty feelings? You're a big help to Patients who actually have cancer. Other times you're just annoying."
You've outdone yourself.,I'll say. My salad's covering a free t-bone steak.
"Cecelia Carter, remember her?","Last week they said it was ""Mystery Stew""ï¿½, they owe me."
That doesn't sound like you!,Then it pRobably wasn't.
"I get that you like to shock people. Stun them out of complacency, out of stupidity. But this Woman thought she had cancer, she had a lump in her breast! What were you trying to accomplish?","Let me ask you something: if this were another doctor, if this Patient were complaining about, let's say, I don't know, Foreman, you'd just dismiss this as the paranoid bitParkng of another paranoid bitch and file it under 'P' for ""ï¿½"
Paranoid?,Am not.
You're right.,Good.
What did you do to Ceci?,"I have no idea. Just a salad today, big breakfast."
He figures the pharmaceuticals need something big to force them into action. This'll get a lot more media play than a thousand African villagers dying.,So he won't take the pills.
Newsweek's calling you!,And he won't agree to any more tests.
He has his diagnosis.,See what happens when you don't listen to me?
"Maybe millions of lives get saved ""ï¿½","Yeah, that's my point. Increased heart rate, night sweats, loss of consciousness! besides rough sex, what do they all have in common?"
"T ""ï¿½",It's not TB!
"Fabry's, autonomic disregulation syndrome, shy-drager syndrome, it doesn't matter. He won't let us test him.","In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot. Yeah, you can quote me. C-u-d-d-y."
"In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot. Yeah, you can quote me. C-u-d-d-y.",Sebastian is refusing life-saving treatment.
"He's refusing TB treatment. You don't think he has TB, ergo you should care less.",He won't let me test him.
And what do you want me to do about it?,Hold him down.
Have you apologized to Cecelia Carter yet?,"Trust me; she doesn't want to hear it from me. Look, the guy is killing himself, am I the only one who realizes this is a bad thing? If he was a Christian Scientist refusing meds we'd have 18 attorneys!. You're putting on make-up. That's not a good sign for my side, is it?"
Sebastian has called a press conference for 3. He's asked me to be there to confirm the diagnosis and the prognosis.,You are as big a media whore as he is.
Of course I am. It couldn't possibly be that I think he's right and I'd like to be a small part of what he's doing.,"Oh, whores can like the sex. Doesn't mean they're not whores. And with that eye shadow! I am totally screwed, aren't I?"
Thank you.,"You want third-world treatment? You got it. Boy, is it hot here in Jani!"
What are you doing?,"What am I doing? Putting Everything on the floor of the hut. Uh oh, wicked magic box with the moving pictures!"
You think he's a hypocrite?,"Hypocrite? No, Everyone in Africa's got cell phones or running water. Hah, this thing just will not flush."
"Do you really think that if you come in here and make it a little hot, make it smell a little, that I'm just going to fold and abandon Everything that matters to me?","Lousy sanitation over there, too. You are not the same as them; your life is not the same. And you are cheapening Everything they're going through by pretending you are."
"I am the same, I'm not special.",You can't deMand to be treated like any third-world sick person and call a press conference!
"No, I have no intention of martyring myself, I'm just putting myself!","Sure, they're dying, but it's got a great beat."
Must be hot as hell under those lights.,Yup.
"Hey, why the page? He okay?","He's in a coma. I need you to apologize to Ceci, Cecily!"
Mrs. Carter? For what?,For whatEver I did.
You didn't do anything.,That has been my position all along.
"X-rays are negative, so he's not contagious at this point, his condition's currently stable ""ï¿½","Do you notice how all the self-sacrificing women in history ""ï¿½ Joan of Arc, Mother Theresa, can't think of any others ""ï¿½ they all die alone. The men on the other hand get so much fuzz it's crazy."
"House, she was scared and unreasonable.","Insulting a Woman with breast cancer ""ï¿½ that's a move best left to the pros. Frankly, you don't have the chops."
"I didn't insult her! I did the unnecessary biopsy, like she wanted. It was negative, like I knew it would be.","What did you do, call 'em perky? You are years away from mad skills like that. I need you to apologize."
"You know, Cuddy's only doing this because she thinks it's you.","Welcome to the world. Everyone's different, Everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB."
What are you doing?,Testing the Patient's autonomic nervous system.
Of course.,"His internal heating and ventilation should be off, shouldn't be able to sweat. That's why he's got that awful body powder. Take it away, crank up the heat, stick him under the lights, can't cool himself. He should be turning bright red."
"Dr. House, I would appreciate it if you left the room.",He's sweating like a pig.
"Did they hear me? The media, did they listen?",He's disoriented.
"They, they have to hear me.",His arteries are clamping down.
"I want Everybody out of here, now!","Get the crash cart, he's having a cardiac arrest!"
I've got sinus rhythm.,That is not TB!
Do whatEver tests you want.,I want to treat you for TB. Dr. Cameron found low sugar in your cerebrospinal fluid. It's a classic finding of TB.
And now you think TB's the pRoblem?,"Nah. If TB caused cardiac arrest on a hot day, your work in Africa would be Even more futile than it already is."
"Can you get to your point, please?","That white board in my office, we're up to about a dozen symptoms now. Cardiac arrest, clearly not TB. CSF sugar clearly is TB. The rest of them could go either way. Unless we know which ones are which I can't diagnose you."
I'll take any other tests or treatments you might want to prescribe.,"So you're not special, but TB is."
"People die of TB because we let them, it's our choice.","People die of malaria because we let them, they die of dysentery ""ï¿½"
"Nah, TB's my disease.","You own a disease? Well, I'm sorry I missed the IPO on dengue fEver."
"Look, I know I have a way about me. I know I piss a lot of people off, and a whole lot more I just annoy. But you're the first person that I've Ever met who I think is actually annoyed by what I do. Do you think I'm not saving any lives, or is that a bad thing?","Right now, I'm just trying to save your life."
"Or do you just have a pRoblem with hope? You know, the difference between our jobs is not numbers or styles. It's that I know I'm going to fail. Even if I save a million people there's going to be another million. You couldn't handle that. I think you resent anyone who can.","Can't we just agree that you're incredibly annoying? Take the pills or I let you die, do an autopsy, call my own press conference, and make sure the world knows that you didn't die of TB. Corporate sponsors will be disappointed, but they'll find another disease."
Why would you do that?,Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch.
Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch.,"So we still have to explain P-R variability, syncope, headaches, and! low sugar?"
Yeah.,This is good!
Good? This is bizarre.,Bizarre is good! Common has hundreds of explanations. Bizarre has hardly any.
What else could cause low CSF sugar?,Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions. I've found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering.
"How could he get high insulin lEvels? We've checked daily blood sugars, all normal!",See how smart she looks? Cause she asked the question.
"And it's not glucagonoma because he has no rash. It's not self-induced because he's not an idiot, and it's not a tumour because the CT and the MRI were both negative.",Which just leaves the tumour.
"Why do you do this? Why do you ignore what I say like I'm not Even ""ï¿½","Small tumour. Really, really tiny. So small we can't see it. Nesidioblastoma."
It only intermittently secretes insulin.,"It responds to stress. Like if, oh, I don't know, if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on11. Easily removed by surgery."
"Except, if it's so small we can't see it, how're we Even going to prove it's there?","""She asked, looking clEver.""ï¿½"
We just start hacking away at his pancreas until he gets better?,How do you prove something exists when you can't see it? Does God exist? Does the wind blow?
We know because the leaves move.,Look for effects.
"Uh, we should look the other way. It's Cuddy with your Patient.",Dr. House has an emergency.
We can't avoid her forEver.,Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?
Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?,"We think you have a tumour, easily removed surgically. We're going to poke it with a stick."
And if there's no tumour?,"Nothing happens. Splenic artery, it's a hard left off the celiac."
If there is a tumor?,What usually happens when you poke something with a stick? It pokes back.
He's stuck in the superior mesenteric.,I knew we should have stopped for directions. Men.
I'm there.,"We're going to inject calcium into your pancreas. The beta cells will release insulin. If there are too Many beta cells because of a tumor, your blood sugar will drop precipitously."
How do we know it won't go too low?,Fingers and toes crossed. Go ahead.
Glucose is holding steady at 75.,No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
I already gave him 1 amp.,"Well, I guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp."
I'm going to start him on a glucose drip. He's going to seize,Not yet.
He's continuing to drop.,Not fast enough.
"He's at 40, 38, 35!","Push an amp of D-50, you want to kill the guy?"
We're back to 40.,"Congratulations, you have a tumor."
"Congratulations, you have a tumor.",Are you going to go out with him?
Is that any of your business?,Nope.
I don't think so.,Two days ago you were holding his hand. What's changed?
"He practically lives in Africa, there's no future.","On the other hand, maybe there's too much of a future now. You weren't attracted to him because he was prepared to die for a cause, you were attracted to him because he was actually doing it."
Right. It's that simple.,That was simple?
I put a label on them and go from there.,Everybody does it. We are who people think we are. People think he's a great doctor so they give him stuff.
He is a great doctor.,"The reality is irrelevant. I'll prove it. People who know me see me as an ass, treat me as an ass. People who don't know me see a cripple, treat me as a cripple. What kind of selfish jerk wouldn't take advantage of that fact?"
Ow!,"Oh, my goodness, are you okay?"
Yeah.,I am so sorry. It was completely my fault.
"It's nothing, I'm fine.","Well, I'm very reliEved, I feel terrible."
"Don't worry about it, I'm fine.",You sure? Okay.
"Thank you, thank you, I appreciate that. I appreciate the support.","It's not about the kids dying Every 8 seconds, it's about the media stroking. Adulation and pats on the head."
"That's your pRoblem with him, isn't it?","Look at him, he loves it. Eats it up."
"Yeah, the Man actually enjoys what he does.","Listen, I saved his life. That means I get credit for Every life he saves from here on out."
"No, MRI showed no white matter lesions, and the shocks aren't accompanied by neck flexing.",Good morning!
It's almost noon.,Really? That must be why I'm so hungry. Who's up for lunch?
What's with the jacket?,"It keeps me warm, and cool. How does it know?"
We're discussing your new Patient.,"Must be a boring discussion, considering that I haven't accepted a new Patient."
You accepted him the moment I loaned you five grand.,"Oh, wait, wait, when I said I'd do anything for the money, obviously I didn't mean it."
"Bad night at poker, or great night with a hooker?",Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke. College student? Nitrous oxide is fun at parties. 'Cause the shocks and drinking 'til you puke Every night can cause Everything else. Give him some B12.
"Been there done that, also ruled out cancer, MS, pyridoxine toxicity, and all the popular neuropathies.",Cervical spondylosis?
Doesn't explain the low white count.,"He's black, I'm assuming he's not just really dirty, but is of African descent. Which means he'd have a lower white count."
Not this low.,"He's a wrestler, pRobably uses diuretics to cut weight, can also cause low white count."
Not this low.,Not this low. Tieshets.
No external outbreak.,Something's missing. Find out what it is.
"Uh, I don't Even know what that means.","Well figure it out, find it out, and then find me, I'll be at lunch."
"Well this, this is perfect.","Invite me to dinner Thursday night. Come on we haven't had a nice meal together since, oh!"
Yesterday when I loaned you five thousand dollars to buy a new car.,My treat.
"Two-wheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles an hour don't really go well with crippled, irresponsible, drug addicts.","Actually two-wheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour do not go well with healthy responsible arParktects who don't know how to separate breaking and turning. Good news is, it brings the price right down."
You're taking it back.,Moooom! How about we talk about this over dinner.
Nice bike!,"Thank you. See that's how you do it, compliments, dinner."
What do you do with your cane?,"If he buys me dinner, he'll find out. Evel KniEvel had the same setup."
"We went though all the imaging studies, and re-did blood cultures.",I don't want hand-me-downs. I want brand new stuff.
Well there's nothing There's nothing!,Sorry I didn't catch that last part!
There's nothing There's nothing else we can do.,You checked the police report?
On what?,On his mom's car accident.
"It was 15 years ago, the kid wasn't Even in the car",She veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight. That doesn't seem odd to you?
She pRobably got distracted changing radio stations or something.,"That's what the police thought. Of course, they didn't know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shock-like sensations"
Genetic component seems unlikely,It's interesting. Type 2 neurofibromatosis could cause the shocks.
You knew this was missing?,"I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22"
"I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22",You'd rather have dinner with your wife?
"Yes, I would. If she were speaking to me.","Unlike her, I could make it worth your while"
Fine.,Should I drive?
Not if you had the stool sample which was negative for botulinism.,He lied to his son about how his mom died?
He was just protecting him,Manipulating him.
It's what parents do.,They lie to us because they love us. Who's getting teary?
"Mom's death is irrelevant. DNA rEvealed no NF2 markers or any other inherited disease. Apparently, she really did fall asleep at the wheel.","SO, what exactly are we talking about here? A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play?"
Excuse me?,Are we talking explosive?
"The haemacel was negative for blood, and I wouldn't say he actually exploded. More like... gushed?","Good, now we're getting somewhere"
Yeah? Where?,I have no idea Hello?
Of course! The riddles.,"Hi mom! Look, err, I have a business dinner on Thursday night, I can't get out of it. I know, I really I wanted to see you too. Uhh, actually, can I call you back? I'm in a meeting right now. Okay, thanks."
Who was that?,"Angelina Jolie. I call her mom. Who thinks that's sexy? So, explosive or gushing..."
"She nEver calls you, is Everything okay?","Great, yeah. My dad's taking her to Europe, they got a nine-hour layover in Newark on Thursday. If it's gastrointestinal..."
You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.,"Are you kidding? I can't lie to my mom. Seriously, I can't! Wilson's invited me to dinner. It'd be rude to stand up a guy who just loaned me 5 grand."
"Transverse myelitis. Could cause numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction, and the shocks.","Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?"
Maybe the infection's gone but the memory remains,"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis"
"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis","You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again."
"Yeah, I know. It's not that it's...",Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?
He went to Jamaica with his friends.,No wonder he lied. Parkldren aren't supposed to have good times.
"One of his friends flew them down. Carnell's dad has this thing about him accepting stuff from rich friends. Wants him to remember who he is, where he came from.",Where have you been?
Making dinner plans. What's up?,The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the Patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.
They seem to actually care,Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.
It wasn't for marijuana. He doesn't do anything but drink,He say that to you or his pops?
Tox screen was negative for THC,"Spring break was over a month ago, Even pot would have washed out by now"
"Even if he'd smoked, no way marijuana causes transverse myelitis",True. But the stuff they put on it does.
Well you wouldn't necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning. He could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed to his skin on a hike.,Or he could have smoked it. A lot of it. And then lied about it because that's what this family does. Start him on IV of pralidoxime. 2 grams per litre and then 1 gram Every eight hours until you see some improvement.
You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.,Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.
Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,"Cameron, who were you making dinner plans with?"
No one.,You bastard! You invited my parents to dinner.
Geez Cameron's got a big mouth!,Hah! Not as big as yours!
Hey! You used me to avoid seeing your parents.,Well what do you care?
"I don't, I just thought it might be interesting to find out why.",You could have just asked.
You would have lied!,And you would have beliEved me! Which would have kept us both happy. You want your money back? Is this what this is about?
If you have the money then why did you need the loan?,I didn't. Just wanted to see if you could give it to me. I've been borrowing increasing amounts Ever since you lent me 40 dollars a year ago. A little experiment to see where you draw the line.
You're you're trying to... objectively measure how much I value our friendship?!,"Hey, it's 5 grand. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. So what do you say? One little phone call and one big cheque?"
"Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner",What do you mean? You just said that--
He's got his appetite back! WhatEver you did is working.,"He's healthy, so all is forgiven. Now I'm feeling nauseous."
He is not healthy. Nausea and diarrhoea were not his only symptoms!,The shocks have also decreased
But not disappeared.,"And he's out of the diaper, which is good news for Everyone."
What about his low white count?,"The little buggers need time to grow. Don't worry, our wrestling Rastafarian will be back on his feet and sneaking around behind pap's back again in no time. Yeah. Check it again. I'll be right there."
What happened?,Apparently I can save money by switParkng to another long-distance carrier.
"Oh I was right, wasn't I?","Oh yeah, it's always about you isn't it?"
What's that mean? I mean... what's happening?,You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.
What's happening to my son!,The truth is... I have no idea.
The truth is... I have no idea.,There's the fEver that Cameron was looking for
"We knew if it was myelitis there had to be an ""itis"". This must be the infection that set it off.","Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--"
Maybe the tests were wrong,"No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fEver, no infection."
So he just happened to catch a bug while he was here? That's all this is?,"Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?"
He just started again.,Again?
It stopped when he was getting better.,"He was feeling better, he was nEver getting better."
And we need to find an answer before this infection kills him.,"That would be the ideal. You intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. You get a cervical thoracic and lumbar T2-weighted fast spin echo MRIs, and you track down all those RiParke Riches who went to Jamaica. See if any of them have got the shocks, the trots or the hots. Hots is the... fEver"
What do you want?,"To apologise. I realise that my attention to the clinic has been somewhat lax of late and I want to make amends. How about tomorrow night, I take the night shift?"
The clinic's closed at night,"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried--"
Dinners avoided?,You're going too?
I love their Cobb salad.,"Give me a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumour about you being a transsexual."
There is no such rumour.,"There will be, unless you get me out of this dinner."
"No one's making you do this, House, just do what Everybody else does, lie to them.",You lie to your mother?
Only since I was twelve!,"My mom's a huMan polygraph. My dad should be taking her to Vegas, not the Louvre."
"Trust me, your mom would much rather think you have a business meeting than you hate her.",I don't hate her. I hate him.
"I don't know. I took some scrapings, it doesn't appear to be ringworm.",What did it look like? Aside from not ringworm.
Any discolouration around the edges?,"Get him in here, we all want to take a look."
Even if it is Kaposi's it's not related. Our Patient doesn't have any skin symptoms and we've already ruled out cancer.,"What are the odds of two friends who've just returned from a trip outside the country coming down with unexplained, but unrelated illnesses? Get him in here."
"He won't come. Just started a new job after graduation, they're working on some big merger.",Tell him his friend's life hangs in the balance.
That's what I told him the first time. Still wound up driving into Manhattan.,Tell him his life hangs in the balance. Tell him the rash is flesh-eating and the next course in the menu is his frank and beans.
But it means the antibiotics aren't working.,Double the dose. And add tygacil to the list.
Soon as he's out of surgery.,Where's RiParke Rich?
He said he can't leave work.,"Yeah, you told me that two hours ago."
I'm not going to lie.,"Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or because you're a coward?"
"Hmm, tough choice.","You've been wasting 2 hours of the kid's time. Is that deeply and unforgivably morally wrong? No. Because it's not a waste of his time. Unless we're wrong, unless his condition has got nothing to do with his friend's. You're just afraid of being wrong."
"Yeah, by vomiting blood. Ambulance is 10 minutes out.",You Taddy?
What?,Love the name. If I Ever have a dog... take off his pants.
Hey.,"Don't talk to her, listen to me"
"He's vomited in excess of 3 units of blood, he needs to be admitted before--","You wanted to be a doctor, maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school"
What are you doing?,Exactly how close were you and Carnell?
Not so close.,Spend a lot of time together in Jamaica? Share a room?
"Wait, you don't think... look, we're not gay.","Not saying you're gay, I'm saying you had sex."
"Look we're not gay, we hardly Even hung out.","Right, so you just flew him down to Jamaica because he won a contest."
"No he's in my frat, all right? Between school and wrestling, and going home Every break to work in his father's junkyard, Carnell didn't have any time to hang out with anybody.",It's not fungus.
I already told you that.,"There's no pustules, it's not Staph... His dad's what?"
His dad owns a scrap metal salvage yard. Carnell worked there during breaks.,You lied.
What are you talking about?,"Oh, yeah, pRoblems with this family, pRobably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard."
"I know the way things work, the better my job, the better my son gets treated.",Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?
No.,"Braided wire, metal weights, lead canister, maybe just a lid. PRobably used it as a door stop or paperweight."
Why would he want to--,"Okay, here it comes"
"I gave him an early graduation gift, old plumb I found. Looks like a fishing weight. Put it on a keychain so he'd always remember where he came from.",So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?
"I don't know. He nEver used it, just kept it as a good luck charm.",Kept it where?
I don't know! Why? Why does it matter?,Where are the kid's clothes?
In the bureau back in his regular room?,You two get it to radiology.
His clothes?,The bureau. Don't open it. You come with me.
The bureau. Don't open it. You come with me.,"Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive."
Whoa.,Call the boys in the lead pyjamas.
"It might not have caused nerve damage, but it definitely destroyed his immune system.",And caused tumours.
We don't know that. None of the MRIs showed anything.,Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.
But he can't. He needs to be in a sterile isolation room to prEvent further infections.,Mom.
We're early.,It's great to see you.
"We came at a bad time, didn't we?","Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check."
"Aww, plans have been made. Wilson made 'em.","I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a compliCated case right now, so..."
"Well, we'll just come back when things aren't so out of control.",My team is busy.
You don't want to see us?,"Mom, don't make me feel guilty."
"No no, of course not! Sorry.",I've got a Patient who's pRobably going to die of radiation poisoning.
I'll buy you a ruben.,Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.
Good!,Yeah?
I just wanted to let you know that Carnell's prepped for surgery.,Thank you.
"New, huh?",Nope. Just gullible.
"So, besides work, what you been up to?",Not much.
You always say that. Not much.,It's always the answer.
"Leave him alone, John.","Got a new motorcycle. Might have seen it out front, it's orange with a gigantic scrape."
Is it the one in the handicap Parking?,"Yeah. Looks like crap, but it drives great."
"Last I checked, you still have two legs.","Actually, three"
"You know what your pRoblem is, Greg?",Shifting gears?
Where's the head?,"Well, good thing we got that cleared up"
Oh he was just trying to help.,I don't need help.
The father and the friend are responding well to treatment. Things aren't looking so good for Carnell.,Thank you. For not eating.
It was none of my business.,"They seem perfectly pleasant don't they? They are. He was a marine pilot. She was a Housewife. Married 47 years. They had one Parkld. Mom was just like Everyone else, nice enough, no great sense of humour, hates confrontation. My dad's just like you. Not the caring 'til your eyes pop out part, just the insane moral compass that won't let you lie to anybody about anything. It's a great quality for boy scouts and police witnesses. Crappy quality for a dad."
"Honey, you're wheezing!",Yeah!
We need to talk.,Oh god. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I really want to finish high school
You have to renew your credentials!,They're good for two more months
"Three weeks. The paperwork takes forEver. Your application, your malpractice insurance, criminal records check - you know that's going to take some explaining",You know; our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?
Yeah! Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice,Rice isn't rï¿½ Oh I get it!
You're also behind on your dictations,"I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody."
You can't have your sole female employee doing your clerical work which you'd know if you'd attended the required sexual harassment seminars. Then I'm going to pause so you can make a crack about harassment.,Joke killer
"House, got a Patient","Sorry, can't play anymore, my mom's calling me"
We just admitted a world class cyclist,You've got to fire Stacy
"Yeah I'll get right on that . Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.",She's loading me up with pointless paperwork
Didn't know you were behind on your pointless paperwork. O2 stats are in the--,"She's hostile. You know me, hostility makes me shrink up like a... can't think of a non-sexual metaphor. She's going to stand over my desk with a ruler checking my spelling!"
"ER checked for lung infiltrates, nothing there","Professional athletes, Cuddy! It's like watParkng an old movie at 2am, re-living all the classic moments. Part where he denies it's drugs, part where the good guys ride in, tests a-blazing, prove that it IS drugs. Oscar clip, he can't imagine how that got into his body! So familiar, so comforting. She can't handle working with me"
"Oh right, yeah, she's still got a thing for you, making it impossible for her to deal, makes perfect sense. Except for the pronouns!","Anyway, thanks for getting me out of that meeting."
"Jeff Forster, this is Dr--","I'm a doctor, you're a sick person. And you are a loved one"
"Actually, Manager. We've been together for sEven years",So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?
There's no way I'd touch EPO. Too Many guys stroking out and dying.,"Damn! Ten bucks for the tickets, six for the popcorn"
Plot twist!,That's a very daring confession
"We've got confidentiality, right?",Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.
Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.,"So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleEve?"
"Well, nothing much recently. I'm in town for a charity ride so it didn't matter if I won. The kids just needed to see me.",So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.
"Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chAmber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics","Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?"
Dr House is a firm beliEver in good old-fashioned hard work.,"This guy doesn't Even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom"
Is the symptom death?,"Respiratory distress. And insanity doesn't cause it, I looked it up."
"It's the doping. Injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance lEvel, but it also thickens your blood. Thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress",Not with a clean spiral chest CT
Guy's sleeping in a hyperbaric chAmber. Over-oxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged--,That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have
Supplements he's been taking contain yojimbo which can cause nerve paralysis,"Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see."
Oh! Air.,Come to papa!
This guy's been injecting himself how Many times a day? All it'd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus.,"The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles."
You were right.,Now there were 3 wasted words.
There is a bubble in his lung. We should do a Swan-Ganz catheterisation.,"I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful."
Is there a light somewhere that goes on when I have food?,"Green for food, orange for bEverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out Every 2 weeks."
How's your biker?,Pumped an air bubble into a vein in his lung.
"The things people do. Doping, Vicodin...",Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?
Hey! You're talking about me aren't you?,I'm just trying to function. He's trying to win himself some little yellow jerseys. Uh oh.
What?,"Trouble in paradise, 2 o' clock"
Your 2 o' clock or my 2 o' clock?,there.
She looks perfectly happy. Obviously they huddled in the hall and worked up this circus act on the off-chance you'd be in here,She was unbelievably pissy 3 hours ago
"Hmm! Pissy with you, happy with her husband. Yes there could only be one possible explanation","When she's angry, she gets sarcastic. When she's annoyed, she's funny, but when she's frustrated, she gets pissy"
"Yes, yes, I'm with you so far","She's miserable with Mark because he's not me. So she's gotta make me not me, so she makes my professional life miserable, if I can't do my job--"
"You really, really, need to get some--","Oh I get some ""some"" all the time, I always need to borrow ""some"" money"
"Hi James, Greg. Gotten to that paperwork?",I've been pissy.
Pardon me?,"I've been busy. When you save someone's life, they owe you forEver."
"You're right. Take Stacy. Oh wait, she'd pRobably just leave you all over again.",How's your recovery going? Gotten around to the small muscles yet?
"My goodness, it's like watParkng Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade. Excuse us",How awkward was that? What's he doing here anyway? He's got physio Tuesdays and Fridays.
"Er, Mark is in group therapy for people coping with disability. He was thinking about dEveloping a drug addiction but that would be stupid.",Hey! Your you again!
Not going to make some joke about Mark being in therapy?,What's there to say? It's only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with
You all right? Jeff! Can you swallow?,"What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?"
Muscle fatigue in his neck and jaw. He's obviously got something worse than an air embolus.,Why?
Because... you don't drool from your lungs?,"Maybe the pRoblem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally."
He's too old for that,"So what would be just right, Goldilocks? Full blood workup, including ANA for lupus. And get a muscle biopsy; find out if we're talking myopathy or neuropathy. I'm late for my session"
"Yeah, right on schedule. So, when am I going to be done? I need to know 'cause I got plans to make. When can I safely book a game of squash? When am I going to stop being angry?","Not today. I've come for the healing. Dr Harper, as you know, I err, I have a bum leg. What you don't know is, I'm upset about it. I need to talk."
You know House! You know we have a history!,You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am. Hi guys
Got a Thursday group.,Poker night.
Monday morning?,"Book club. Well look, if it's a pRoblem, I'll just go deal with my rage privately."
"Wait. If you two could resolve this tension, you could really help each other.",I'm tired of fighting.
What? So either I say yes or I'm the jerk?,"Oh god, I know that feeling."
At least you can still get around on your own.,"Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better."
"You have a job, a way to be productive.","You have a wife, which gives greater meaning. Wife could make things harder too I suppose."
This isn't about Stacy.,"When it happened to me, Stacy was great. She kept telling me not to rush it. I nEver beliEved her."
She means it.,"I know, but... Stacy... She shouldn't have to wait, right? And you know she feels it too. Needs more time at work, needs more satisfaction from work. She didn't get married to be a nursemaid. She wants a Man."
How the hell could she have loved a Manipulative son of a bitch like you?,That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.
She left you.,But why was she with me to begin with?
She made a mistake!,"Maybe it's that simple. Or maybe she saw something in me, something that she doesn't get from you."
I'm not an ass!,Maybe she wanted an ass. She obviously did once.
"Either he goes, or I go!",You think that's the kind of thing you can just turn off?
"Dr House, cancel your book group. You're coming on Mondays.","Here's my new theory. The drooling is another competitive edge. Nobody can drive behind him, the road gets slick, he's the only one not racing in the rain!"
He can barely move his arms or legs.,Paralysis?
"Jeff doesn't want normal, he wants superpowers.",So why is he normal?
"Oh god, you too?","He's shooting for extraordinary, so why is Everything so ordinary? I mean this guy's breathing, drinking and injecting himself with Everything he can find to amp up his body chemistry, and yet Every test is normal. He's artificially raising his red blood count, so why isn't it raised?"
Maybe his count is raised; maybe what's normal for us is out of whack for him.,Can't slip anything by you.
That's kind of a long shot.,"Yeah, but it's been over an hour since we poked the Patient with something sharp so, get a lumbar puncture. And order broad spectrum antibiotics."
Apparently not,"So glad we cured his respiratory arrest, freed him up to dEvelop respiratory arrest."
"The white count is still the same, but the red count's fallen to 29 percent.",What was my theory yesterday?
I didn't screw up--,"Why would you be so petty, Chase? He's down a court. Either he's losing blood because you nicked something, or he's just not producing blood in which case we're talking acute anaemia combined with a muscular disorder."
Paraneoplastic syndrome?,"Either you screwed up, or he's got cancer."
I think I should start smoking again.,You want a medical opinion supporting that decision?
The symptoms started as soon as I quit.,Symptoms meaning diarrhoea. A lot of diarrhoea.
"Ten or twelve times a day, it's really embarrassing. I'm a flight attendant, and...","Well, if you're upset, my hiccups are gone."
You went to his group.,"Well you were the one who was all 'Greg, you need to confront your feelings'."
that was 5 years ago.,I've been pissy.
"Fine, you don't want help; does that mean nobody should get it?",Mark's looking for help because... what? He's resentful? Overwhelmed? I'm asking because I care.
"Not about him, you still want to jump me so you don't care who's married--","Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder."
"Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.",How Many packs?
A bit over one a day but they were lights and I quit. You used to go out with her?,Yeah. What was I thinking? I'm talking about the gum you're chewing; you Ever play smoking as an oral fixation. How Many packs?
I'm trying to protect you. Cuddy and I may be the only people stopping you from jumping off a cliff just to prove that you--,You're pissy.
Oh I am angry!,Pissy. You only get pissy when you're frustrated.
Shut up!,"Ok, I'm wrong."
"This is unbelievably difficult for Mark, which you should know, which you should be able to summon up some lEvel of empathy for.",Right. The cripple boys. We should start a band.
"I have a good thing with Mark, we are handling this the best way we know how.",And none of this has anything to do with me?
"No, nothing! Except that you can't, or won't just let it go! Let it go.",You're being poisoned.
By gum?,Sugarless gum uses sorbitol as a sweetener. We use sorbitol as a laxative.
"Well, he's negative for bleeds.","Congratulations, Chase. It's cancer. Clean him up and let Oncology have him, it's their party now."
Unless it's drug-induced. He's lying about not being on EPO?,Why would he lie?
What does it matter?,"People lie for thousands of reasons, but there's always a reason."
"Philosophically interesting, medically irrelevant.",Unless he's not lying.
"I assume if I point out the fact that you have no right to do that, you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt?",Wilson's chatty. Plus he's got two ex-wives to support. You want me to tell him he's fired?
"Until we figure out who's behind this, I'm sitting in with you guys. You have the ethics of a four-year-old; I'm going to treat you like one.",How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder?
Responsibly.,You know I can't do that!
Somebody once told me that Everybody lies. Since you're the only people who know he has cancer--,He doesn't have cancer.
"The point is, you're his medical team. He's threatening to sue.",Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? He's on EPO.
Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? He's on EPO.,"Your anaemia is caused by pure red cell aplasia. This is going to hurt, but we got to talk."
What the hell are you doing?!,"He'll be fine. Sort of. I don't have time to watch him write out answers PRCA comes in two varieties, chronic and acute. Since it came on fast, you have the acute version."
He doesn't have cancer?,"That's the good news. Bad news is, pants are on fire. Acute PRCA is caused by drugs, most commonly, EPO. Ready, and... action!"
I haven't used EPO.,"Ok, this time, more anger! Remember, this guy's accusing you of cheating."
I haven't used that stuff.,"Oh mwah, I beliEved it. It was simple, it was pure. Did you beliEve it? I guess it's silly to cancel someone over the first audition. Why don't you do a reading?"
Give me that! He doesn't do EPO!,"Hmm...what do you think? That was a different way to go but, I don't know, I just didn't buy it. Does she handle any of your injections?"
You think I'm giving it to him? Test him!,"Gee, that's a great idea. I sure hope that EPO's not one of those drugs that's undetectable after six hours. Hey you know what we can test for? Phone calls. Take her cell phone, push the redial button, Even money says it'll be connected to the newspaper that leaked your cancer story Okay..."
That stuff could kill me.,"Come on, give her a break. She's only doing what she has to to advance her career. Don't you have that tattooed on your tushie?"
I would nEver do anything to hurt you.,Who're you going to beliEve? Manager you've trusted for years? I've been to college
It's not possible. The drugs should be flushing out of his system.,Can't leave if they don't exist.
"But EPO use explains Every one of his symptoms. He's been lying and cheating, and now it's coming back to bite him.","The only pRoblem with that theory is it's based on the assumption that the universe is a just place. If it were, then his poor Manager wouldn't have been fired for no reason."
You're still not explaining the PRCA.,What's his red count now?
"Had to give him a blood transfusion, he's back around 30.",He needed a transfusion?
"Well he was losing blood, so I thought maybe he needed blood.",Go forth and scan his neck.
His neck?,Or repeat Everything I say in question form.
Or repeat Everything I say in question form.,She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.
Hmm. Yelling. That might be a clue.,"I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational."
Anger's not rational?,"Some anger is. She could have pulled me aside, screamed at me privately. Her beef is simple and well-founded. She was out of control."
You're having fun aren't you?,"She's in my face, I need to know why."
Professional reasons.,"Oh, why else?"
How'd you know to look in his neck? Thymoma's usually present in the chest,I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.
All the more reason not to think--,"There are two types of PRCA. Acute comes on suddenly, chronic takes its time. We all thought Jeff's was acute because it happened right in front of us. What if it had been there for months? Maybe years?"
Blood transfusions.,Which he was getting in convenient blood-doping form.
He was treating himself without Even knowing it.,Up to half of Patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of Patients with a thymoma! I've always wanted to do this.
Ow.,You are healed! Rise and walk.
Are you insane?,"In the Bible, you just say ""Yes Lord"" and then, start right in on the praising."
"First you tell me I've got cancer, and then you tell me that my Manager-- What did you do?","No, what did you Lord. Thymoma is a tumour in the thymus gland. He's a bit of a wimp, but he hangs with the tough guys. PRCA and an auto-immune disease called myasthenia gravis. MG causes muscle fatigue, including respiratory pRoblems and difficulty swallowing."
It can hit you that fast?,"Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria. You were doing both as part of your regular freak show. When you took a break Everything went to hell!which is not an uncommon reaction in Jersey."
So... the whole thing with my Manager..?,"Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear."
"I could. Or, 10 percent of a Nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash.","You don't need your thymus. Take it out, Everything else is Manageable."
Manageable. I thought you just cured me.,"Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic. This just erases the symptoms of MG for five or six minutes Sometimes less. This is exactly why I created nurses. Cleanup on aisle three!"
"You've come to search my office; you should wait ten minutes I'll be out of your hair. Here, start with my purse just save me some mints. What do you want to know? My sex life with Mark? My guilt over crippling your damn leg? Or are you just here to gloat because you weren't the leak?","I want to apologise Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long. And maybe you've been punishing me. If we're going to work together, I need to know - do you hate me? Or do you love me? Either way, I think we've got a pRoblem."
I hate you. And I love you. And I love Mark.,You don't hate him?
No.,So what do we do?
We deal with each other.,Right. That plan's been working great so far.
"It'll get better, it'll get easier.",Why?
You'd be surprised what you can live with.,"Hey, I need you to open that door."
Not allowed.,"Yeah er... I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane."
Sorry.,Dude! I'm crippled.
My offer's withdrawn; you can walk to work.,"Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome."
How do you rationalize something like this? You broke into Stacy's therapist's office--,Borrowed a key
--and stole her treatment notes!,"Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote ""Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communiCate, like he resents me because I can walk."""
I don't want to hear this.,"Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up. Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking about I can't read that, is she obsessed with a Grey Horse? Or me?"
It says she thinks you're an annoying jerk.,It's a pet name. Here's the kicker.
They're not having sex?,"Doctor cleared him, but no liftoff. She's frustrated so she's doc-blocking me. Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my Patients"
"Great, now you've got the proof you need. Just take those personal psych records to Cuddy, that'll show her Stacy's out of control. You ignoring me?","While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?"
Over here!,"Dr Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker"
Your waiting room sucks.,I am not treating you.
Err... we're not... err... together.,"He is so self-loathing. Well, we've got to go now, so maybe see you after work--"
"No, no, no! Ah... nobody can figure out what's wrong with me.","Well your shirt is gaping at the collar, means you lost weight, you're flushed, that's fEver, and you're short of breath. And finally there's the KS lesion on your face; means you're HIV positive, you've progressed to full-blown AIDS. So you're sick because your immune system is shot and someone sneezed on you. Can I be excused now?"
"Brilliant, but, my immune system is fine.",Your concentration camp physique begs to differ. Get your T-cell count re-checked.
It was negative.,All of this will be fascinating to an HIV specialist. Now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend.
"Honey, I will marry it if you would look at my file.","Congress says you can't, so..."
"Congress says you can't, so...",I didn't touch him.
Go see Stacy.,"We gave him epi, he's fine."
"You need a Lawyer, go see Stacy. You hit a Patient.","Four words, two mistakes. He's not a Patient, and I didn't hit him."
"Of course you didn't, go see Stacy.",I didn't cause the anaphylaxis. It's pRobably one of his HIV meds abacavir.
You have to treat him.,"Medically, this case is a snooze-fest. AIDS plus infection."
You don't treat him he charges you with assault.,"Just 'cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true. Watch, I am surrounded by naked cheerleaders See? Although I like my chances of some action this morning."
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day. This could've waited!,You make me meet you at your House. Your husband is conveniently absent.
"Mark's at physio, I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator. I saw a rat last night.","Well, I'm surprised your feet are touParkng the floor."
I barely slept.,"What was Mark up to? Memory serves, quick climb up Mt. Gregory, and you dozed through a seal hunt. Clubbing, shrieking."
What're you doing?,"Sorry, it's driving me nuts."
You hate washing dishes.,People change. I could make sure you'd sleep like a baby tonight.
Rather take care of that myself.,I was referring to the rat.
What's going on?,"It's not what you think. I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes, but actually we're having sex."
"Take ten minutes, cure the guy, and stop whining.","I give you Kalvin Ryan; so flamboyant in person, so boring on paper. Obviously got an opportunistic infection, pRobably TB or PCP."
Have you read his file?,"I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional."
"He went to an HIV clinic last week. Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV. It's not an infection.","HIV clinic. So few Patients, so much money; re-do the tests."
The results make sense. Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.That's strong enough to fight infection.,"Fine, parasite."
Face it; this might be an interesting case.,What if his immune system is too strong?
"An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.","His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep. It wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight. When it doesn't find an active infection, starts attacking the harmless remnants of old infections. Immune reconstitution syndrome."
"His meds made him so much better, he made himself sick. Sounds pretty--","BORING! This is so not interesting. Chest X-ray and find the old infections, start him on steroids."
"If you're wrong, steroids will tank his immune system. He'll get worse.",Now THAT would be interesting. Where's the coumadin?
If your Patient's got a blood pRoblem then blood thinners aren't exactly--,It's for Stacy's rat; death by anti-coagulation.
Trying to win Stacy back by killing an animal... very caveMan.,"I don't want her back. I just want her to admit her feelings for me. I go to Cuddy, Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her. Either way, I'm happy."
"If you want her back, either tell her, or, better yet, shut up, and cry yourself to sleep like Everybody else.","Hi, this is Mark Warner, 1724 Spring Street. Listen, you don't need to send that guy down, we caught him. No, you should send the bill to Princeton-Plainsboro hospital. Attn: Dr Wilson, yeah."
It ran into that heating vent right there.,Hopefully Mark's anger will go away Eventually.
"He's not angry, just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.","Didn't seem really wild about you, either."
He's fine with me.,He's angry. Said so in group.
Of course he's angry; he's looking at months of painful physio.,He's mad at you.
There's no way he said that.,"No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time."
Might be the hospital.,What!?
Bad time? Where are you?,At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.
His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered the immune reconstitution.,He a smoker?
"Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes. His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.",Not surprising. Not medically relevant.
His heart looks a little enlarged.,That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?
"Toxo, CMV and PCP.",Well let's assume it's one of those. Give him Ganciclovir for the CMV...
"Whoa, we can hardly hear you. Where are you?","In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time."
"I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis. Your chances of conversion are slim, but I'd like to put you on three antiviral medications; finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine. There are side-effects - headache, nausea, vivid dreaming. You'll be tested for HIV in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months...",Very interesting.
"He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?","The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung."
I closed the tear.,"Well it takes immune reconstitution off the table. What's it put on the table? Its ok, she's not here. You can skip the nice guy acts."
You know some huMan beings are actually capable of huMan feelings.,My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.
Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.,"No edema, no blood in urine."
I'm fine.,"Oh this is good, he's pretending to care, you're pretending not to."
I think we should reconsider drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.,Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs. Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.
"It could be, if his drugs were tainted. They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...","Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Foreman, you're with me."
"Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Foreman, you're with me.",I need a consult on another case.
You have another case?,It's a hip-pocket deal. Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.
Wry Neck. Is he an athlete?,He's a regular runner.
Any pain associated with movement.,None that he's complained of
"Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs; worst case, brain stem tumor. Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full work-up.",Uhh! I don't think so No insurance.
"Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium. Beryllium dust inflames the lungs, they get rigid, Patient can't breathe. My father co-authored a paper on acute berylliosis.","Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis."
I can handle it.,No reason to risk exposing the entire team. Then who would I torment?
You broke into my House?,"Well I had to, Mark isn't here."
He has physio.,Oh really? How's he doing?
What happened with all the cheese?,I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin. I named your rat. Steve's tilting his head. Any neurologist will tell you that suggests an infection or brain stem tumor.
Death cures both those things.,"Well we can't kill him. If it's an infection, it could be caused by something in your House, something that could affect you guys . Smell this, does it smell like urine?"
Oh!,"You missing any asparagus? Ok, stuff these. He doesn't get better, then it's a tumor."
Then what? Chemo?,Steve McQueen without hair? It's a blessing he died young.
You ok?,"She's fine, pRobably getting bored with the question. Masses in the heart and lungs, what kind of cancer are we looking at?"
"Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.","So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either!"
I wanna do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.,Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Do it.
Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Do it.,So! how is the Patient's father?
Uh!,'Tell my dad I'm sorry?' Might as well wave the red flag at a bull.
He's not coming.,"Well it's not a tragedy, dad doesn't want to see him, he doesn't want to see the dad. You're the only one who wants them together."
He asked!,"He thought he was dying. Dying people lie too. Wish they'd work less, they'd been nicer, they'd opened orphanages for kittens. If you really want to do something, you do it; you don't save it for sound bite."
What did you say when you thought you were dying?,"On the other hand, his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?"
So you just show up Every time he's at physio?,"'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends."
And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by?,You tell your wife Everything?
"It's a! process. But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark. As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.","My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me. And you know why she thinks that?"
Because she still has feelings for you?,"If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right!"
So how long do we stay here?,'Til something happens.
He's not going to come out with us right here.,"We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss."
He's not blind.,Steve McQueen does not run from danger. Antibiotics on the other hand!
He ate around the pill? Smart!,"Admit it, you like him."
He's alright! for a rat.,"You wanna now how cool he is? His urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead. He's a smoker. Your husband's been lighting up; which is particularly stupid, it could cause his AIP to!"
"Okay, I blow my smoke into the vents so Mark doesn't know.",I always knew.
Bluffing!,"You started two weeks after my surgery. Menthols, then lights after a month."
Why didn't you say anything?,"'Cause it helped me monitor your misery lEvel. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell."
You could have asked me how I was!,I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.
Come on Chase; don't turn into a good guy on me now.,You're late! and hung over. Or maybe not.
Why do you have a rat?,Jealous?
Like hell it isn't! You said you didn't call!,Don't mind me. Just here for the show.
"Yeah well, there's not going to be any.","What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all 'Daddy, I'm so sowwy.'"
This is none of your business.,You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested. So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.
Now why would I do that?,I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.
That's a lie!,"42nd Street? Much easier to just get drunk and beat him. Explains his hating you; also your cirrhosis. Also why the more I talk, the more you sweat. What it doesn't explain, is why he's gotta apologize to you. Residual guilt for sharing your special toy with other boys?"
Just leave it alone.,Just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after you're gone?
"Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing to do with him being gay! Now Kal brought this on himself, with what he did to his mother!",He steal her signature look?
Kalvin lied!,"Yeah, that certainly is shocking."
"Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin, he was a match. He was also positive for HIV, mom nEver found a qualified donor, she dies.",Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?
Uhh... yeah!,Brother's on the down-low got to
You?,Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase?
I'm not an idiot.,Obviously not. Who doesn't sleep with a drugged out colleague when they have a chance?
Where's Wilson?,We got the result for the Kveim test.
So now you've got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life. Could hit another Patient.,"Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic."
Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.,"I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection."
The rat is actually sick? That thing could infect the entire hospital!,Steve's infection is not contagious to huMans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?
Yeah. Remember the Black Death? Started with rats,What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?
He just won't go in the room. Who knows what else he has - parasites? Bacterial infection?,Kid doesn't have parasites.
"Not the kid, the rat!",Was he still sweating?
Rats only sweat through their tails.,"Not the rat, the dad! Where are they from?"
Err! Montana. What's going on?,"You were right, it's a parasite. Cancel the biopsy. It'll kill him. Hey daddy, come with me!"
"Yeah, uhh! I'm not going in there.",Your son asked to talk to you.
Why is he here?,He wanted to talk to you.
It's Montana.,"Those masses in your chest are not tumors. They're parasitic cysts from a bug called eParknococcus. Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard, they can hunker down for decades -- growing, spawning, shopping, putting on plays."
I've been tested for parasites.,"Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, Even in blood tests, cardiac--"
"All right, you don't need me for this.",But you've got the same things in your liver.
I have cirrhosis.,"Liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition, fEver. Now liver cysts we can test for. Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's. So, option A, we draw some blood--"
"No, look, you're not touParkng me.","You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life."
"If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine; could have saved her life. You wouldn't be lying here!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it! You're really mad at him for killing himself and for destroying Everything you love. I don't have time for this, are you going to apologize?"
I'm living my life the way I want.,Are you going to give me some blood?
"Look, if he doesn't give a damn then neither do I!",Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?
You know you don't know a thing about my Suzanne.,"Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid. Used a Twinkie instead of a gun. And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything!"
Shut up!,PRobably nibbled on Every devil dog in the county!
SHUT UP!,"Just in case I'm not making myself clear, I don't mean the delicious snack!"
You son of a bitch! Yeah? Come on!,"Thank you, means I can do this We're going to need some epi in here, stat!"
Are you out of your mind?!,"You said you didn't care. Notice how you can't breathe? Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! I'm gonna schedule surgery."
"You said you didn't care. Notice how you can't breathe? Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! I'm gonna schedule surgery.","Two successful surgeries, two lives saved. I'm over my quota. Can I have next week off?"
Two family members assaulted.,It was self defense.
You baited him.,"You're right. I was asking for it. The low-cut blouse, the 'Do-Me' pumps."
"You flooded his gut with a parasite, he could sue. Go see Stacy.",Okay.
That's it? Okay? No name-calling? No squawking? No rending of garments?,I like this T-shirt.
Heard you hit another Patient.,"Yeah, sure. Why not? He hit me first."
Cuddy didn't mention that. Let me see.,I'm the doctor.
"My concern is purely legal. Looks okay, does it hurt?",A little.
You need some ice.,There's no way that Mark doesn't know; about the smoking.
He would have said something.,Then he hasn't been near you in months.
We're fine.,Can't be easy.
Stop squirming.,Why would you lie about this?
I'm not lying.,"I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not, but you're not, so!"
I am.,You're lying.
You know when I have sex? You can smell that on me too? The only people who know about what's going on between me and Mark are me and Mark.,I just know you.
"And I know you. You're confident, arrogant, but you're nEver certain unless there's a reason to be certain. One other person knew, I told you I was seeing Dr Harper. You can easily get into her office, you read my file. You read my file? The dishes, the concern, the, oh, acting like a huMan being? You have! This whole time you've been Manipulating me?","You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush. You could have thrown me out, or ignored me, or found another exterminator. You didn't Even tell Mark that I kept coming by. You LET this happen because you wanna be with me."
"Because 40% of our lawsuits last year were about House. You can't work with him, you can't work here.",She's over-reacting.
"You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.",So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?
Yes! And yes.,The file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul. The only thing I did wrong was get caught.
Where's Chase?,"He's too busy to service you until after work. I got a couple of minutes though. Feel free to say something like ""What'll we do with the time left over?"" Or you could just stew. That works as well. She stews before she gets violent."
This one says you're okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow. This one says I've advised you of your legal rights.,"Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?"
Nope.,Great. And you thought this was going to be awkward.
Takayasu's arthritis.,Get a sed rate and serologies. Parkld proof. How Many kids are hopped up on vicodin?
Gimme.,"Right, like I'd Ever get it back. Chase."
"No, she'd have oral sores.",Or genital. Go find them.
She'd have oral sores.,Or genital. Go find them.
Or genital. Go find them.,"Whoa, whoa Foreman! Chase can handle the pelvic."
She's only advising Chase? Not you?,Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't Even met this Patient.
"Your disdain for huMan interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you. You sign the charts, you're responsible for Everything Chase does.","Which is why this doesn't matter; she protects Chase, she protects me."
"Unless her advice to Chase is to make a deal and give you up. ""I'm so sorry, if only Dr. House had paid attention, he'd nEver Even met her, he nEver does.""",Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.
Cameron loves you. Chase loves his job.,You really think Stacy hates me that much?
Systolic BP's 70.,Where's the ulcer?
Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.
Two months like this.,"Let me guess, no insurance, just heard about the free clinic. It's a good move. You don't want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players!"
I need to talk to you.,From the doorway?
It's confidential.,Cool. I love gossip. Hear that crackling sound like crumpling up paper? Keep listening. Let me know if it changes.
Two questions. Why did Chase screw up and how bad was it?,Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.
He said he did.,"Well I'm not a Lawyer, but that seems like a sucky legal strategy."
They're gonna wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in Chase's position.,"If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him."
God you two are a couple of geniuses. Deny Everything; completely fool the Lawyer who's trying to help you. Too bad the review committee members are actually doctors.,Stacy.
"Bleeding ulcer, we've got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.","If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you."
"If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.
Systolic BP's 70.,Show me the ulcer.
It's brown. I cauterized it.,"Sweep back, show me the whole stomach. Stop."
Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.
Let's go.,She was not fine 2 hours ago. She mentioned stomach pain?
"Yeah, so I gave her a stronger--",You didn't do an exam.
She just came in for a follow-up. The results of the pathergy test.,Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?
"Maybe if she'd said something about taking ibuprofen, mentioned the rectal bleeding!","Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--"
Doctors skip all the time! It was a minor mistake; I couldn't have known this was going to happen--,Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This Woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!
She might die because I had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills!,"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about."
"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.",Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.
"Excuse me, testify about what?","Uhh! Chuck. I'm going to break from the parable of the wicked doctor and tell a little story about a Patient. Let's call him! Buck, who has low O2 stats and crackling lung sounds."
Like I have?,"Buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. His lung tissue's turning to rock. There's no known cause, no treatment. He is slowly suffocating."
You're talking about me?,"Lung transplant's about a half a million dollars, but this poor sucker's got no insurance. If he tried to sign up now, he'd be excluded, pre-existing condition. But let me confirm with my Lawyer . She confirms. If only Buck hadn't been diagnosed with fibrosis before he got insurance. So... back to the exam."
That's how you tell this guy he's dying?,"Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance."
Such a hero; always righting wrongs. Who cares who you have to Manipulate.,I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close.
It's a point of principle.,Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.
There's nothing for us to talk about.,That's why you're following me. I read some notes--
If Chase screwed up--,"I was wrong. Terribly, terribly, sorry."
"If Chase screwed up so badly, why didn't you fire him?",He has great hair.
What are you hiding?,"I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers..."
Forget it. We can't give a liver to a Woman this sick.,Do you listen to what you're saying?
It's healing.,"You know what's really killing her? Chase forgot to ask a standard question about stomach pain, so he missed the diagnosis, so she perforated, so she got sepsis, so her BP tanks, so she got blood clots, so she lost her liver. Livers are important, Cuddy; can't live without them, hence the name. And here's the big issue, Chase is a hospital employee, and Kayla is the sympathetic mother of those 2 jury-friendly moppets Caleb and Cody."
"Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.",That is a medical reason! The family wins this hospital in a lawsuit; they'll turn it into condos. And people will die waiting outside a condo for medical care.
Your Patient's hardly clotting.,Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op.
Pretty risky.,Well that's why I came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital. She's dead without you.
Get her in this afternoon.,Thank you very much.
"And this was right before you ran the marathon, I suppose?","Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?"
What'd you do to him?,"The hospital Lawyer asks me if I did something unethical. If I did, the last person I tell is the hospital Lawyer, especially since she's gone all 'old testament' on me."
You'll tell me.,"Oh. Ok then. One caveat, I've moved past threesomes. I'm now into foursomes. If someone backs out then you've still got a threesome. If two people back out, you're still having sex. You'd be amazed. Even if three people--"
"Anything you say is attorney-client. So you can get advice about the bad, bad thing you did, knowing I'll be tortured because I can't tell a soul.","Actually, it is kinda cool."
"Are you completely out of your mind? She's dying on her own, why would I volunteer to be her executioner? I'd just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother, no matter what!","5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip."
I make 600 grand a year; you think I'm going to risk tanking my percentages for 20 thousand?,It's tax free.
"For the record, I hope the department takes you and Chase and drop-kicks both your asses out the back door.","Great; means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?"
"Great; means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?","Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs. And you didn't thank her. Well that only happens when you're very, very intimate. That and the fact that you've been practically dancing around with your zipper open, used condom stuck in your shoe. Your wife is apparently the only one who doesn't know."
There is no way you'll tell her.,"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free?"
"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free?","Hmm. Oh, and for the record, you are the worst transplant surgeon in this hospital. But unfortunately, you're the only one who's currently cheating on his wife."
You bribed him and then you blackmailed him?!,She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made AyersMan do the surgery.
Leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee.,Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.
"Hey now! Don't do that! Hey what are you nuts?! Please, please! I didn't do it! I didn't do anything!","Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife."
You blackmailed AyersMan before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway?!,"Doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"You just can't control yourself, can you? No matter how stupid, how self-destructive--","To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you? You're not mad because I broke into your psyParkatrist's office."
"Yeah, I was thrilled about that.","Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that Everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it."
No I wouldn't!,You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid.
You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid.,"Let me tell you a story about a Patient; the Patient we'll call, Fusan."
It's just stress from the strep.,"Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already."
You House?,Umm... well that depends. Are you going to hit Dr. House?
"Could be Hep B, Hep C, right? It's treatable. You give her interferon, she's ok. Right?",You know a lot about hepatitis.
He just donated his liver.,You're flushed. You sick?
I'm tired.,You're hiding the fact that you're sick. Now why would you do that?
"Hey, wait, what are you!","Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job. It's a very common way of getting Hep C, which you have. You've had it a long time."
It hasn't been active in years. She was going to die if I--,You paid someone off? That is TOTALLY unethical! Get an MRI for him and his sister right now.
"She got Hep from me, didn't she?","No! No, no, no, God no! I think she got cancer from you."
"Just been served with papers. Actually paper; one page. Defendant Princeton-Plainsboro hospital and Dr Chase; blah, blah, blah. Medical malpractice, negligence; blah, blah.",You're surprised they're suing? You think people love Chase so much they're gonna just forgo--
Larry Wusekus. He's not crazy.,Ooh! I've been sued by him.
You have been hiding things and lying to me all day!,I haven't lied about anything. Except for the parts that I admitted I was lying about. And I'm not the one being sued. I feel funny.
"I was hung-over when she came back to see me. I'd been up half the night drinking, had a headache and I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Couldn't have cared less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain.",May I speak to my future former employee?
May I speak to my future former employee?,Great story.
You think I'm lying? It's exactly what I told him.,I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.
I killed his sister!,I ordered black coffee this morning and got cream. Everybody screws up.
They didn't put poison in your coffee.,I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.
What does it matter why? Is she less dead if I have a good excuse?,"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you."
You knew?,You were depressed and distracted. I assumed you'd gotten a phone call from your stepmom.
Dr. Chase?,"Good news is, both your parents are dead now so! no reason to screw up this bad again."
How'd you know?,"There's this interconnected network of computers, or interweb where you can--"
How did you know to look?,When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.
Why didn't you tell me he was dying?,He asked me not to.
So you just hung me out there to be blindsided.,"Yeah Chase, it was all my fault. Look, you got a choice. You can either tell the truth, hospital settles, family gets some money, they get to keep their House. Or you can keep up this lie, family gets punitive damages, they buy a jet, they move to Park Avenue, and you have to find another career."
You're not going to say anything?,"I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames."
Is Chase telling the committee about his dad?,I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.
I wouldn't do that.,Why not?
You're my client too.,"Yeah. And that's not going to change unless you leave this job. Or I do. So how do you deal with a coworker that you have feelings for - positive or negative. I don't want to end up like Chase, I don't want to get emotionally caught up and kill! you."
Maybe you were right... maybe that is the pRoblem.,So what do we do?
"After considering the testimonial and documentary evidence, this ad hoc committee in the matter of Kayla McGinley has reached a decision. Dr. Chase, your error resulted in a Patient's death. You also lied, both to your superiors and the Patient's brother. But taking into account the mitigating factor of your father's death, we've decided not to revoke your privileges. You'll receive one week's suspension and a letter in your perManent file. Now as for Dr. House! there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action. And yet, there is enough in the record to be very troubled by your conduct, including certain allegations of blackmail from members of the transplant team and by your general refusal to meet with your Patients. It should be noted that your Patient's cancer was diagnosed as the result of a direct physical examination of---","Not of the Patient, I met the brother. NEver met her. You want me to go to a family reunion Every time I take on a Patient?"
"The committee has determined that for no less than one month, Dr. House will have his practice supervised by another doctor, to be designated by Dr. Cuddy. This proceeding is adjourned.",Did you know this was coming?
What's happening to Chase?,Now you're fired!

Nice to have inside information.,Is anybody here a doctor? You trying to cop a feel?
I took a CPR class at the Y.,That would be useful if she was having a heart attack instead of a seizure.
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?,If you want to get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.
"Methodist is three blocks down, I could drive her.",Just make the call.
What the hell is that?,How should I know? Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsboro. The doctor's name is House.
Gambling doesn't take away his pain.,"It does when I win. Hot OTB babe, has grand mal and inexplicable bruising. What up with that?"
You were just standing there and she started to seize?,"Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick."
"Hot OTB babe? Obviously a working girl, pRobably an STD, infection.","No fEver, no infection."
"Alcohol abuse explains it all. Causes seizures and affects her blood's ability to clot, which causes bruising. Start her on heparin, she'll be fine by morning.","Except for the fact that the bruises are not peteParkal, which means it's not DIC."
"So the bruises were caused by trauma. She pRobably got beat up by a boyfriend, or a pimp.",What's that called when you Judge someone before Ever meeting them?
She's a regular at OTB. Somehow I don't see her holding down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.,I was there. I have a 9-to-3 job.
"It could be SLE, Familial Telangiectasia, or Even Cushing's.",Good. Start with those.
Which one?,Cushing's. Explains the seizure and the bruising.
Not the anemia.,So she doesn't eat a lot of meat.
"DIC brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely. Do a full workup, H and P, and lab her up, LP, MRI ""ï¿½","Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just, Ever so subtly, order me to get her medical history?"
"Cuddy put me in charge last week, so yeah.","It was a pretend ""in charge""ï¿½, formality to get past the suits in Legal."
"Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep your Parking space.",You can have it. You'll also need my handicap placard. Bend over.
"Well, you make a pretty convincing argument.","Chase killed that Woman, now Foreman's in charge?"
"""Do you wear a seatbelt?""ï¿½ Is that really relevant to a seizure?",Skip it.
"How about, ""Were you vaccinated for polio?""ï¿½ I think you gave me the form intended for FDR.",Will I like Teeny Tiny Moe in the fifth?
"I went 4 for 6 yesterday. You want winners, cure me first. ""Are you generally satisfied with your life?""ï¿½",It does not ask that.
You know; I was going to ask what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor. Somehow that question doesn't seem relevant anymore.,What's your excuse?
Turns me on.,"Yeah? What else turns you on? Drugs? Casual sex? Rough sex? Casual rough sex? I'm a doctor, I need to know."
No sex; just moved here. Haven't Even found a job yet. Don't know anybody.,"Came here without a job. That means you didn't move here, you moved away from somewhere else. Does that hurt?"
No.,Are you on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?
I already answered that one; I think it was question number 20-something.,"Well yeah, and I could reach down and get it, but that would kinda spoil the whole ""cool move.""ï¿½"
I'm not on any medications.,You vegetarian?
"No, why?","Because you might have something called Cushing's syndrome, which basically means that ""ï¿½"
"My pituitary is overproducing ACTH, which is causing my adrenal glands to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.","What a coincidence. I'm a doctor, too."
"Yeah, I had it last year. They did brain surgery, removed an adenoma from my pituitary.","Huh? What did you just say? ""You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew, it is Cushing's, uncanny how you do that!.""ï¿½"
"Actually, it was Cameron's idea.","Nope, Cameron had three ideas. I chose one to encourage, to nurture ""ï¿½"
"Yeah, you're all about the nurturing.",You need a hug?
I don't see any regrowth. You get her medical records faxed over?,"""Work smart, not hard,""ï¿½ that's my philosophy, boss."
Still don't see anything.,"Okay, so it's a micro-adenoma, too small to see."
So small it's not Even there.,"Right, it's just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that she happened to have a year ago."
Results from her LP back yet?,Didn't do an LP. Knew what she had.
Go do the LP.,"Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps."
I'm observing.,She's here to make sure I don't paralyze you.
"You've done this before, right?",Successfully?
He's kidding. He's an excellent doctor.,"I'm gonna numb the area with some lidocaine, and then we're off to the races! See what I did there? I used horse racing jargon to make the Patient feel more comfortable. Okay, here we go."
Ow.,Felt like bone. Does that hurt?
Trying rounding your back a bit more.,"You're perfect just the way you are. Oops, that was all me."
You might want to move down one vertebra.,This is actually much harder than I remember.
"Try taking a deep breath. Dr. House, maybe I should take it from here.",Eighth time's the charm.
"You trying to piss off Foreman, huh?","Just let ""ï¿½"
BP's 240 over 140.,"Turn that thing off, will you?"
Take the needle out. Take the needle out!,"Okay. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office."
"Okay. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.","At the risk of sounding redundant, and right, again, she has Cushing's. Cushing's."
"Right, the fact that you Mangled her LP has nothing to do with it.","Actually, it has Everything to do with it. Cushing's plus stress equals hypertensive crisis. Smart move, sending the rookie."
Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced DIC. She had a hypertensive crisis because it's been at least six hours since she had her last drink. She's detoxing.,The exact same moment that I'm futilely trying to give her an LP?
Not as rare as an invisible tumor.,"Why didn't they put you in charge instead of Foreman? Oh yeah, you're the guy that killed that Woman. Get a pan-Man scan before she dies of cortisol OD."
You ordered MRIs for the entire maternity ward?,I was in a crazy mood. Good thing I got a new boss to back me up. Although I think one of those is actually necessary. Better comb through before you cancel them all.
"What do you expect me to do, House? Quit? Cry?","Actually, I expect you to act like what you are, my employee, my subordinate, my bitch."
"Well, since you asked nicely!","My God, I can't beliEve I got more than a year behind on my discharge summaries. Gotta get caught up. Oh no, wait! I'm not authorized to sign these anymore! Only you are."
"Looks malignant, pRobably inoperable. I'd give her two months.","On the bright side, it still means I was right."
House assisting. That is funny. Too bad Foreman's gonna die.,"Good afternoon. I'm going to be looking at your ""ï¿½ Perfect. Excuse me. Need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room 1 for a consult. So when did this start?"
A couple weeks ago. I didn't want to get pregnant. Jake's not into rubbers so I got on the jelly. You think I'm allergic or something?,You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.
I brought the jar.,"No, I meant a sample of your ""ï¿½ Okay, we have a neurological pRoblem here."
There's something wrong with my brain?,"Oh yeah. You can cover yourself up, got what I need."
What's up?,"Smell this. Smells like vaginosis, but it's not really my call."
"Great, I'll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board. Anica's biopsy for pancreatic cancer was negative.","Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile."
How long?,"On an evolutionary basis, I'd recommend forEver."
"Good news, she's not sick at all. Other than being an alcoholic.","The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter. She's got Cushing's, something set it off. It's gotta be in her brain, set her up for a venous sampling."
"Chase, hold on.",How'd you get him trained so fast? Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?
Maybe she didn't read it because she knew there was nothing wrong with her. There is another explanation for the Cushing's; maybe she injected herself with the ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen's. She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.,"Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you."
She's had zero symptoms since she got here. The scarring on her pancreas could be caused by injecting herself with a benzene and setting off the seizures.,She's had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache; you can't fake a brain tumor.
"You can fake an invisible one. We should check her apartment. Look for medications, syringes ""ï¿½",Venous sampling's easier.
And more dangerous.,Not if you get caught breaking in.
Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me? Have I done something wrong or if there's something I needed to improve on!,Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?
How would you describe my leadership skills?,"Nonexistent. Otherwise, excellent."
There's more to being a leader than being a jerk!,The world will nEver know.
"No, no way. It just snowed.","Yesterday, streets are clear."
My car is right there.,There's construction on Elm. Bike will be faster.
There's Even books in the bathroom.,"Well, either she's very smart or she has a sEvere fiber deficiency."
"She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday. Multiple appointments with multiple doctors, symptom of Munchausen's.","Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading. There's three pairs of reading glasses, each with different prescriptions, which would be explained by a tumor pressing on the optic nerve."
Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.,And you are looking for! A person with Munchausen's syndrome drinks battery acid; they don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.
An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.,How Many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not Munchausen's!
It's not your call.,"If you think she's got Munchausen's then obviously you've got something to show the Man! A syringe in her apartment, a bottle of ACTH."
Munchausen's Patients are good at covering their tracks.,"Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there's something."
"It's possible the surgeons just missed it. In that kind of surgery, you're just cutting and hoping ""ï¿½","Of course! We're both right! Excellent solution. Everybody's happy. Come on, step up, Foreman. If you think I'm right, order me and stick a needle in her brain, and if you think Cameron's right, send the Patient home. Either she'll be fine or she'll die."
Do the venous sampling. Get her consent.,"Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass."
I just agreed with you.,"Not because you think I'm right. You're just taking the safe route. You're a wuss. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. Hey Wilson, guess what Foreman just did!"
"Well, maybe longer. Would you be interested if this wasn't just pretend?",What did Mommy say; I don't get any candy in my stocking?
Also the sign of a sociopath. What are you doing?,"Correcting your last note. We can't discharge her, she's sick. Anybody Ever tell you, you write like a girl?"
What? You got some other explanation for orange urine? It's Munchausen's.,"Correct, but not complete."
You just don't wanna admit that she skunked you.,"At the end of ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,""ï¿½ the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents."
The wolf doesn't eat the parents!,It does when I tell it.
"You're not telling the story now, I am.","Look, I checked her records. All her hospitalizations were for different things. Brain tumor, fainting spells, skin rashes, seizures! she's had Every blood test known to Man and the results are all over the map. There's only one constant, low HCT. The anemia's real."
There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.,"True. Could just be her MO. She self-induces two illnesses, one always changes, one nEver does. Or maybe she has Munchausen's and aplastic anemia, which would mean without proper treatment she'd continue to get sicker, weaker; Eventually she'll start bleeding internally and die."
She's not getting sicker.,She will!
If her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected. Her white count's normal.,So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
"No, no more tests.","Look, you kick her to the curb with a Munchausen's diagnosis; you're guaranteeing that no doctor will Ever listen to her again."
"We do more tests we'll only be feeding her psychosis. The more attention we give her, the more she'll want.",What if she doesn't know we're testing her?
"House, you were wrong. Live with it.",There's pRobably some blood left over from previous tests.
Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.,"Yes, I know. That's why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause."
"Fine. You wanna test the extra blood, knock yourself out. But the Patient is off-limits.",And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.
And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.
You're gonna need more blood.,Patient's empty.
Then I can't do it.,You can try.
"i can try to look like Salma Hayek, that's not gonna make it happen.","You may not have Salma's ass, but she doesn't have your eyes."
No. There's no way this is going to happen.,"""See him walking down that street, so I ask you very confidentially, ain't he sweet?""ï¿½ Epstein-Barr titers are through the roof, most common viral cause of aplastic anemia. So what I'm saying is, ""Just cast an eye in his direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection ""ï¿½"""
Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.,"Eh, just a wee bit. Could indiCate ""ï¿½"
"Uh, you see that in sickle-cell.",Not all sickle-cell Patients are black.
"None of her other blood panels showed any sign of sickle-cell, which means either something's changed drastically since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.","Of course it is! Metaphorically. Look, I couldn't do the tests. I tried, there wasn't enough blood left over. If you just let me do the biopsy!"
"No way, I just got back from a suspension.","And if it wasn't for me, you would have been fired."
Why don't you just get the sample yourself? Since when do you care what your boss said?,"I don't care what anybody says, I care what they do. Right now, Blackpoleon Blackaparte has got the nurses on red alert, I can't get into the Patient's room. So come on, I'll draw the enemy fire, you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample."
Can't.,Who are you more afraid of?
"I'm not afraid of Foreman. I agree with him, all the tests back him up.",All the tests have not been done. You do realize that Blackaparte's reign is only temporary.
"I also realize that no matter what I do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.",Crap is a relative term.
Nurses called the attending as soon as the trocar was ordered.,You used her real name?
I just processed your Patient's discharge papers. She's on her way out now.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up! It's all right, she's going to stay."
Wonderful.,"Oh, bite me."
I don't need to hear the riot act again.,How'd you like another medical test?
What?,Sit.
Why?,So you don't crack your skull when you pass out. Just do it. You know what colParkcine is?
No.,"Well, don't feel bad. It's for gout. It's got nothing to do with anything you've Ever pretended to have."
"I'm not pretending to have any ""ï¿½","Shut up. ColParkcine decimates your white blood cells, leaves almost no trace. Great for faking your way into hospitals."
"I didn't fake my way ""ï¿½","Shut up. You've been doing this for years. Don't worry, it's pRobably not your fault. When you were a kid, you had a close relative with a chronic disease, pRobably sister. And you saw all the attention she got while you were left alone, ignored, and it really, seriously screwed you up."
"I did not have a relative ""ï¿½","Shut up! I'm trying to give you what you want, and save your life. You have aplastic anemia."
"What, are you trying to scare me now?","It means you're not just sick in the head. The pRoblem is, the rest of you appears well, so I've got to make you seem as sick as you're supposed to be by injecting you with a drug that simulates the symptoms that you actually have. All you need to know is, you've hit the Munchausen's jackpot. I'm going to give you a cocktail of insulin for seizure, and colParkcine to kill your white blood count. This will absolutely confirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia. There is one small catch. If you've actually done something to yourself to cause the anemia, then I'm wrong, and if I do what I plan to do, then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you. So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room?"
No.,Good. Give me your arm.
"It was my mom. She had MS. She was in and out of hospitals all the time. People were always trying to do things for her, bring her food, or brush her hair, make her happy. People cared. She died when I was 16. Then there was no one.",Boo hoo.
Where are you going?,"Well, I obviously can't be around when it happens."
"Well, what are you gonna do, you're just gonna leave me ""ï¿½","Relax. You know the drill. People walk by here all the time, you'll be fine."
We can't. Her white count's down.,"Sorry, I missed that. My hearing's been off since the Ricky Martin concert, some chulo kicked me in the head."
"White count, hematocrit and platelets are all off. The bone marrow's shutting down, she actually has aplastic anemia.",Say what?
"All her other labs show nothing that ""ï¿½",Labs schmabs. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.
You were right.,"Hey, hey, hey, we're not here to play the blame game. These things happen. Sometimes doctors send people out on the street to die after other doctors warned them that they were sending them out on the street to die. There's no way you could know."
Okay. Where's Dr. House?,Turn it off.
Now what?,How long has she been in there?
"Three minutes, what's going on?",She doesn't have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.
"No, her white count would be through the roof, hers is on the floor.",The body does crazy things.
She had no fEver.,"Because her self-inflicted Cushing's suppressed her immune system, stopped her from having a fEver, hid the infection. Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruising, the sParkstocytes, the anemia!"
Explains Everything except the white count.,"Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don't we try that?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're taking the safe course? What's going on?",There's lots of explanations for low white count.
Name one that fits her case.,"ColParkcine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-mediCated."
That's brilliant of her. Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.,People do crazy things.
You injected her against her will just so you could be right.,She consented.
She's mentally ill!,"She smells oh, so sweet."
"She smells oh, so sweet.",She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.
Is Everything okay?,"Hold my finger. Grapey. You have a bacterium. It's on all of us, but the bruises you gave yourself with the Cushing's made it a lovely home. Bacteria moved in, Parked their cars on the lawn, there goes the neighborhood. And by neighborhood, I mean your internal organs. So, should we put her on the Augmentin, boss, or do you think she infected herself with grapes? I love the smell of pus in the morning. Smells like! victory."
"She should have died. House is not a hero. A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they're a hero. House doesn't break rules, he ignores them. He's not Rosa Parks, he's an anarParkst. All he stands for is the right for Everyone to grab whatEver they want, whenEver they want. You tell doctors that's okay, your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.","Kinda digging this whole ""Foreman in charge""ï¿½ thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you!"
"Yeah, that's a big change for you.","Now Cuddy's on Foreman's ass, not mine."
You couldn't live with Foreman as your boss.,"Why not? People could change, you know?"
WhatEver you think is best.,"Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win."
"Don't say anything; don't attempt to defend your billing practices, your billing practices are indefensible.",We've been over this.
"If I thought you were capable of listening, I'd shut up.",That makes no sense at all.
Ah. Okay. Then let's go through these.,All of these?
"Patient, 62-yrs-old. You prescribed Viagra. I look in vain for the words 'erectile dysfunction' in the notes for Delores Smith?",She had a heart condition.
And you ran out of nitroglycerin?,"She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they're vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches."
I think Doctor House understands--,"Well of course I do. The Woman has a heart condition and she's on her own. A Man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time."
Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?,"Fine, I'll pay for it. How much are the pills? She took how Many?"
Are you trying to bribe me?,No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.
What can they do to you? And Doctor House is sorry about his earlier outburst.,Absolutely!
Absolutely!,You do background checks on Medicaid personnel?
I do what's necessary for my client. Wow! New personal record!,"Yeah, time's good for me too; got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor."
You booked us dinner reservations?,Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.
Don't you have a plane to catch?,Not for hours.
Your flight leaves at 7.,You did a background check on me?
And mine doesn't leave until 9pm. It looks like you'll be dining alone.,"You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage."
I didn't think we'd be finished this soon.,Where's your crucifix?
I left it at the jeweler's to be cleaned.,Riiight.
Uhhh... Excuse me. Hello.,"Hey Honey, how are the kids? They miss me?"
This may take a minute.,What's new with Mr. Aphasia?
Cuddy called you?,Everybody covers their ass.
"Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen, came back positive for amphetamines, he did the dance of victory.",I'm betting there's another shoe.
I thought the kids didn't call you.,I know the way you tell stories.
"Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test, found him running a temperature.",So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep.
"Honey, you shouldn't do that.","Ok, I gotta hang up. They're pRobably trying to reach me."
You don't have call waiting?,I'm hanging up on you now.
Foreman.,How high a fEver? Put me on speakerphone. And why haven't you called me?
101. How'd you know?,"What, you think you guys could have a party as soon as the parents are gone and I won't hear about it? Start with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial meningitis, and an anti-viral in case we luck out and its herpes encephalitis."
What if it's auto-immune?,Well then we're screwed. Which is why we need more information. Any genetic issue with the family?
"The Man can't talk, his medical records are sketchy, and wife's only known him a couple of years.",MRI show anything?
CT scan was negative.,"CT... that's like, short for MRI, right? Excellent, well I guess that saves us a lot of time."
We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes. Earliest Foreman could get the maParkne.,"I teach you to lie, and cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line? Get an MRI, and get a better medical history."
The Man can't talk!,Who cares? He's pRobably going to lie anyway. My flight's a little late; we'll be back in a few hours.
What is the durable? No.,Got you some coffee. So... what do you want to talk about?
"Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.","When people give themselves away, it's by little things. That Woman over there, she's not sneering at her coffee, she's recovering from Bell's palsy. And the cashier at the coffee place, she doesn't want anybody to know she's dying of ALS. There's a particular sort of twitchy stiff arm that's characteristic. And then there's you. Why aren't you wearing your cross?"
"Oh, I told you I left it--","You keep jewelery cleaner under the sink so you won't have to go a day without it. True, you forgot it that morning that our pipes burst, but then you went back and waded through the flood to retriEve it. Soo... why no wading today?"
It's different. Yeah.,"Either you left it behind on purpose, or by mistake. The only reason you'd leave it behind intentionally, is if it no longer meant anything to you. But since it was a gift from your mom, that would mean you had a fight with her. But since you don't talk to ghosts, that's unlikely."
"Leave it alone, Greg.","Yeah, I'm good at that. So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally, but then we'd have to explain why you didn't go back for it when you realized."
I didn't realize until I got to the airport.,"Nope, you were in make-up when you got to the airport. Can't put on make-up without looking at yourself and you can't look at yourself without touParkng that thing."
Why does this matter to you?,It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.
I'll be right back.,"I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke, but then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse."
"We had a fight. We had a fight and I was angry and not thinking straight, and I walked out without my make-up and without my cross! I stopped at the drug store to buy make-up, but I couldn't buy a cross because they don't have an aisle for personal talisMans!!!","So you had a fight, I'm sure it'll blow over."
It was about nothing.,"Of course it was. Mark's tired, he's worried, he's got mobility pRoblems. It's normal that he'd blow up over little things."
"I don't mind fighting over little things! I don't Even mind fighting over big things! That I could understand. But we fight over nothing! You know a mailbox with a sign that says ""last pick-up 5pm"", does that mean last pick-up to go to the post office, or last pick-up to leave the post office and be sent out of town?",You fought over mail delivery?
"I tried to get him to drop the subject, but he wouldn't. I told him he was right, he thought I was being condescending.",You were.
He's pushing me out of his life.,Maybe you're misinterpreting.
Did I misinterpret with you? At least this time I recognize it. That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you've Ever loved they're better off without you.,"Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer."
Hello? It's for you.,House.
Do you know your phone's dead? Do you Ever recharge your batteries?,They recharge? I just keep buying new phones.
I thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal.,What's his creatinine?
"It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture, there's no choice anymore.",You have to do it just right.
What are you talking about?,"Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge. Is Cuddy there ranting?"
If I'd known you'd be out of contact--,They can handle it.
Right. So far only 3 organ systems have failed.,"Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office."
What do you mean by doing the LP just right? We're not going to screw up.,The odds are this guy knows something we don't.
"He could know the answer to the meaning of life, the Man can't communiCate!",Have you had any indication that he's tried to communiCate something important?
No.,"That's cause you guys haven't scared him enough. I'm sure you've been all ""oh we'll take read good care of you"", why should he say anything? When you prep him, tell him he's going to die. Crush all hope. Don't let Cameron do it. Cuddy, you got a pRoblem with any of that?"
"Attention please, due to weather conditions, our flights are grounded until further notice. Cots are being provided on the lower lEvel. We apologize for the inconvenience.",Want me to run down and reserve you a cot with view?
Where's your knapsack?,Checked it through.
"Oh, that's right. I forgot it was hard for you to carry and walk. I booked a room at the airport hotel when I saw how bad the weather was; it was the last one available. Your leg can't handle a night on a cot.",Thanks.
I'm ready.,Right.
The hotel's upstairs.,Does Mark know about this?
Mark knows when things are bad I always like to have an escape route planned.,"I have to know what's going on here, cause when you have a fight with Mark, and you try to avoid me, I have to think that--"
That I'm feeling vulnerable and I don't want to be around you because it might lead to something.,Right. But then a hotel room...
Might also lead to something.,Hmm. So... which is it?
Our relationship is like an addiction. It's... like...,Really good drugs?
"No, it's like... vindaloo curry.","Ok, sure..."
"Really, really hot Indian curry they make with red Parkli peppers.",I know what it is! Didn't think it was addictive.
You're a jerk.,I know If you hadn't just had a fight with Mark...
For once in your life will you shut up?,House.
You're on speakerphone.,How did the LP go? Give me the reader's digest condensed version.
"Preliminary results are some kind of infection, which... narrows it down...","From infinity, yeah."
"At the rate his organs are deteriorating, he's got maybe a day or two.","Ok! Well, call me back when you have something."
He was trying to tell us something!,What did he say?
"You were wrong, it wasn't the fear. He opened up to me when I...",Sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment. Classic interrogation technique. What did he say?
You knew that I'd--,"Act the way you always do? Yeah, I did. What did he say?"
Now all we need is the English-aphasic dictionary.,"A fluent aphasic retriEves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants. They can be filed by sounds or by meaning. So if he wants to say table, he could say... label, or he could say chair. Or he could just say Jabberwocky, there's no way to tell."
"He also said ""they took my stain""?","Hold on. Uhh... I'm going to take this phone downstairs, so I don't disturb you. Is that ok?"
Sure.,"Keep him talking. Write down Everything he says. Stacy, that new make-up you bought, do you mind if I borrow it?"
Let's start this again. Bear - is it bare as in naked?,Crimson desire shows up well on sheet rock.
That's why I chose it.,"Well you must have gotten one new phrase out of him, something?"
We've been talking to him for hours. Maybe he's just given up.,Are you sure you told me Everything you found in his home and office?
Maybe House is wrong.,Hope that's not the end of the thought.
"When his wife's not in the room. The more devoted, the more reason to lie.",That's cynical!
You disagree?,"No, I'm just kvelling. Our little girl is growing up! Ok, what's the best way to rip a Woman from the side of her dying husband?"
Your flight's been boarding for 20 minutes!,I'll take a later one.
"Greg they can't leave without you, you checked your knapsack.",Are we in?
Yeah.,"Hi, I'm Gregory House; I'm your attending physician, your wife's not there, start talking."
"They took my stain! I couldn't tackle the bear, they took my stain.","Ok, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron. Give him the list again."
Are we sure he wasn't reacting to pain? He's been on painkillers.,"Come on Chase, drugs didn't do this to him. Even if he is an addict."
I dissuade the tonal Category.,"Oh please. Mr. sleeping pills, amphetamines, bring me up, bring me down."
"Will passenger Gregory House, please report to Gate 7. Gregory House to Gate 7.","Ever hear this one? Build a House, each wall has a southern exposure, big bear comes wandering by, what colour's the bear?"
White. It's a polar bear; you built your House in the North Pole.,"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?"
"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?","What's that? I can't see, is he nodding?"
Yes.,"Topamax isn't just off-labeled for weight loss. It's off-labeled for mood disorders. Plenty of bipolars are Manic in the daytime, depressive at night. He's been medicating for years with alcohol and sleeping through the bad hours. It explains the danger journalism, explains Everything including the kitchen sink. Ok, technically it's kitchen cabinets. He starts a project, then he stops."
Except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures.,"And it doesn't shut down your kidneys, but what it does do--"
"Excuse me sir, can I see your ID?",I'm on the phoneï¿½ I'm on the phoneï¿½
Gregory House--,"Look, I'm a Doctor, and this is an emergency call."
You'll have to come with me sir.,I'm not going anywhere.
You think you're gonna take me on?,"I kick, and I bite."
"House, you still there?","Being bipolar makes you take risks, you seek excitement. You make up stories."
I dine valutate a lEver!,"Fine, maybe your stories are legit. People would start to wonder. Annoyed politicians, entire governments would be on your ass. You couldn't tell anybody you were bipolar, which was fine. Until you fell in love. And you wanted that life. And you hear that there's a surgical cure, give the Woman you love the life she wants. All you have to do is change. Bilateral cingulotomy, an experimental surgery that some people claim helps mood disorders."
Which explained nothing because it wasn't Even in the right area.,"It's not the surgery, it's the secrecy! What causes recurring fEver? Neurological pRoblems, lethargies that you fight with caffeine pills and amphetamines. It wasn't your secret psych disorder; it was your secret daily drug use. It was the secret trip, and your secret surgery in Caracas or Buenos Aires, which by the way didn't work given the state of your kitchen cabinets."
House! Shut up.,What's going on?
You just don't trust me.,Get some blood on a slide. Do not put it through a computer this time.
"Fletch, she'll be back. Give her time to miss you.",I'm counting on you to get me off the no-fly list.
Is your Patient going to be alright?,"Physically, his chances are good."
Physically?,Two people who weren't meant to be together. Maybe they'll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much.
"Yeah, that's usually the way it works.",He loved her enough to convince himself he could change.
"But he couldn't, could he? You know what Woody Allen said about relationships? ""Irrational and crazy, but we go through it all because--","--we need the curry""."
I'm on it.,"Morning, Jimmy. Anybody die while I was gone?"
Did -- did you iron your shirt?,Thought about shaving; couldn't find a razor.
What the hell happened in Baltimore?,"Sorry, Parkef. I nEver kiss and tell."
"there's no such thing as ""just a kiss.""",Did you iron *your* shirt? Everybody's flash today.
Are you planning on asking her to leave Mark?,Not sure. Cameron keeps my calendar.
Hey. This is a big deal. This is an affair. Have you Even talked to Stacy about what the hell this means?,Didn't have a lot of time for talking. If you know what I mean.
Great. Breaking up a marriage; fertile ground for high comedy. We need to talk about this.,"Gosh, wish I could. How did the HIV test go? Did you study up?"
I rescheduled for this afternoon. We have a new Patient. 34-year-old female. Movement disorder.,Movement disorder? Fascinating.
This isn't just gonna go away.,No. But maybe you will.
"According to her husband, the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car.",What does the flailing look like?
Her arms spasm uncontrollably and there's a mild facial twitch.,Demonstration?
"You wanna know what it looks like, go see the Patient.","Ooo, snarky. Was he like this the whole time I was gone?"
Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on Tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds. Counteract the estrogen.,"It's a great idea, if you want to kill her baby. Movement disorder can present in the first trimester."
She's not pregnant.,"Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate. Get a real pregnancy test. You know, the one with the blood and the hormones and the rabbit. Oh, I'm sorry. It's still your limo. Whaddya say, Miss Daisy?"
WhatEver you want.,Lame duck's done quacking.
"You quack, people shoot at you. Cuddy just put me here to make you miserable. Another two days, you can go back to making yourself miserable.","Okay. Get an MRI. See if it's in her head, or in her uterus. You're gonna want to paralyze her. You run tests on a flailer, somebody's gonna lose an eye."
"Hyper-vigilance, sudden irritability...",Symptomatic of! lunch with Cuddy?
The Patient now defines Huntington's.,Then what do you need me for? Start her on Huntington's meds.
Could stroke.,"If we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis. Then her kid will nEver get the chance to say goodbye. Wanna tell the class how that feels?"
Huntington's Patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.,She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time.
"All the signs are there. Movement disorder, psychosis... It should be Huntington's.","Yeah. That'd certainly make your job easier. Well good news for Margo, it's not Huntington's. Bad news for us, the psychotic break eliminates fertility meds; which means we have no idea what's wrong with her. We give you so much, and you give so little!"
"None of her family members are sick, nobody at her office, her volunteer group, kid's classes, and PTA members. All fine.","So she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work, she volunteers at school, attends PTA. What makes mommy run?"
You're thinking drugs?,"Cocaine. Explains the psychosis and the flailing, and the uncanny ability to bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan, and nEver Ever let Teddy forget that he's a Man."
I'll go look for her stash.,Take Foreman. There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.
I know you're in there. I can hear you caring.,The door was locked.
"It's for a Patient. She can't roll. Now lock that door, too.",Paranoia; must be the good stuff. Times like these I wish I had cancer. So what did she say?
"That depends. What did you do, and who are we talking about?",We both know that as soon as we talked you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle. I need to know what she said.
I have a crazy idea: why don't you go talk to her?,Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.
I didn't say *do* her. I said do *something.*,What exactly did she say?
She didn't say it was a mistake.,She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab; too much guilt.
She left you.,"Harsh toke, dude."
House.,Killjoy.
Prescribed to her daughter.,Mommy does Everything for her family these days. Even swallows their pills.
It's possible the kid's meds are the kid's meds.,"Pop enough Ritalin, it can explain Everything."
Tox screen will confirm that.,Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system. We're done. Get rid of her.
We're not done. We have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else.,"Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet. You just can't resist. You're like a diabetic at the ice cream counter. You want to say no, but you need that chocolaty goodness."
"Yeah. Well, I'm still signing the charts. So until tomorrow, you're not allowed to kill anyone.",Wuss.
We've asked her three times if she's on any meds.,So we don't ask *her.*
So we don't ask *her.*,"Candy striper. So, you like dogs?"
She's not on any medication.,"Well that's strange, because this bottle has her name on it. And I think these are medical pills inside."
Doctor prescribed Stella! a few months ago. I nEver told you about it because I nEver gave her any.,"Hmm. That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty. You missed a couple of days. Take five."
Stop.,"Why? Unless they're not hers. You need some water, sweetie?"
I'm not taking Ritalin.,Come on. All the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too.
Should take a couple of hours to process her. Then you can take her home and divorce her.,Working late? Or are you just avoiding Mark?
"It was one kiss, Greg.",So far. I'm planning on keeping a chart.
"I'm moving back to Short Hills, I think it's time.",You're leaving?
It's nEver meant to be perManent. And now that Mark's getting better!,Yeah. Much better. Except for the whole walking thing.
He needs to get back to work.,Right; saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream. You're running away because the kiss meant something.
I'm not running away. I'm going home.,With Mark.
What's going on?,This better be important.
You've gotta come back in.,No I don't.
"Margo's stable, but--","Oh, my God. Well, I'll be right there."
What took you so long? It's midnight.,Traffic. Cinco de Mayo. You owe me a 100 bucks.
You didn't take the test?,Fear trumps anal Every time.
It's not a big deal. I had the viral load and antibody tests. It's 99.9% that I don't have HIV.,"You have the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose! nearly 100, right?"
No arrhythmia. So Ritalin isn't the big pRoblem. Something else is going on.,Fine. Let's play doctors.
Wouldn't explain the movement disorder.,"Nothing explains Everything. What if it's a crime syndiCate? Let's say Ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper. Ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing--"
I still don't think Ritalin--,Fertility meds are competitive by nature. They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.
Which could cause clots. Which could have caused her to stroke.,So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie.
So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie.,Cameron. I love you. Get your test results tomorrow.
The prescription for my heart condition; a bit on the cheesy side.,I was trying for roMantic. Still fits.
Mmm.,Did you tell Mark?
"Am I going to tell him? Still working on that phrasing. How about; 'Know all that stuff you were worried about when we first came here, Honey? You were right.'",Pithy.
Everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.,You already did the hurting part. He just doesn't know it yet.
No cancer.,She's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.
"Millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.",Right. They get babies. She had a blood clot and a stroke. She'll get another one and pRobably die if we don't find that tumor. Do an endometrial biopsy.
What?,Shh.
If you have a personal issue that's interfering with--,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
What are we waiting for?,Your four weeks just expired. Your reign of terror is over. Mine is just begun. Now go stick a needle up her hoo-hoo and find that cancer.
What are you watParkng?,TV. What are you doing here?
Ted's with my mom. He asked the nurse to watch me.,What nurse?
Do you still have the balloons?,No.
Do you want to play something?,Nope.
When can Mommy come home?,Don't know.
What's wrong with your foot?,War wound.
Does it hurt?,Every day.
That's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.,They say that a lot?
They don't fight.,Not Ever?
People who love each other don't fight.,Right. Forgot that. What floor was that nurse on who was watParkng you?
House.,What?
I'm here about Stacy.,What about her?
I think I'm losing her.,"Your wife, your pRoblem."
She won't talk to me.,"So what, you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink."
She keeps saying Everything's fine.,Find a bar and talk to a stranger.
You're the only one who's been through this. I'm shutting her out. I'm saying things and then hating myself for saying them. How did you get past that?,Didn't.
Can you please be a huMan being for one minute and talk to me?,"Sorry; gotta go, people dying."
House.,You're not ready for this.
I've seen the way you and Stacy talk to each other.,You're an idiot. You pRobably just set your rehab back three months.
Let go of me! Get off of me!,Liver tumor doesn't make sense.
You saying the CT was wrong?,I'm saying the symptoms don't add up. A + B does not equal liver tumor. We gotta solve for X. We gotta look at this differently. What do we know about her?
Side effects of the Ritalin caused the--,No. We've examined the file up and down. Come here. Give me that. Why do you people always overlook the huMan element? What do we know about her? Margo! Dalton; the Woman.
She's a people pleaser. She doesn't like to let people down.,NEver fights with her husband.
She went to drugs instead of asking for help to Manage her life.,"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?"
"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?","Foreman. Need your help here. You want to pull a bank job. Would you go it alone? If you're gonna Rob a home, sure. It's a one or two Man crew. But a bank. Lookout. Getaway driver."
I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.,"So here's the caper. Fertility meds create a distraction. Mommy had 3 refills on the Ritalin in the last 3 weeks. That team goes straight for the top floor. Has no trouble taking out communications , but--the specialist, Safe Cracker. All he does is stroke, blood clot, liver tumor. Foreman was right. This bad ass Even does flailing. Come on. Only one guy I know does that kind of work."
Birth control pills?,"While the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your liver, should I have them do a hysterectomy too?"
A hysterectomy? I'm trying to get pregnant.,"You don't have to lie to me. We're not married. You're supermom. You can do anything. You work sEven days a week. You volunteer. Raise a kid. Yet you still somehow find the time to lie to hubby number two that you really, really want to give him a Parkld with his Parkn and pretty brown eyes."
What makes you think that I don't--,Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.
That's it?,Also.
What are you going to tell my husband?,"That I'm canceling the surgery. You can do the explaining. It's tricky, huh? It's one thing to say you can't have a baby. It's another to say you don't want one. Personally I'd make up some other lie."
Could--could I die on the table?,Could you die if you tell him the truth?
You can't cancel the surgery.,"If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own."
"You have no proof the birth control pills caused this, you have no proof she's Even taking them.","Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy."
"Or, we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.",Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.
"Here's what I think she's gonna say. Oh, I love Greg. But if you go against a Patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar. And if something goes wrong, I end up in court having to defend the big mean doctor, albeit with dreAmy eyes, who wouldn't beliEve the nice suburban mom. And Even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery.",Shocking. It's benign.
People do crazy things for love.,No. Crazy is hanging out in the Park all day talking to pigeons. Margo knows what she's doing. She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.
"No, she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover up her pathetic lie.","It's twisted and Manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...roMantic. I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee."
Do we need to talk?,Nope. I'm fine.
"You don't know. In a few years, we'll give up. Stop trying to get pregnant. We'll hug; cry. Eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it. And he'll appreciate Stella Even more. And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years.",Something you need to see. Knowing is always better than not knowing.
It's a referral request.,Right. HIV thing came in earlier. You're fine.
"You won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?",It said confidential. I wanted to know.
The most important letter of my life and you're still an ass.,"Comforting, isn't it?"
Hey!,Hi.
I'm going to talk to Mark tonight. And I'm going to stay here with you.,Don't do it.
This isn't funny Greg.,I know.
You... spent all these months chasing me. Now I'm here and you start running? What the hell changed?,Nothing. Nothing changes. I'm not going to change.
Who asked you to?,Mark is willing to do whatEver it takes. I'm not. NEver was.
"Oh, now you're introspective? Weren't so analytical the other night. [Beta Comment: My mom has this saying! about a cow and free milk.",You were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.
What?,"How do you think this is gonna end? We'll be happy for what? A few weeks, few months; and then I'll say something insensitive, or I'll start ignoring you. And at first it'll be okay. It's just House being House. And then at some point, you will need something more. You'll need someone who can give you something I can't. You know I'm right. I've been there before."
Oh. Oh. It doesn't have to be.,"It does. It does. I don't want to go there again. I'm sorry, Stacy."
What did you tell her?,I told her she's better off without me.
You're an idiot. You don't think she'd be better off without you.,Right. I sent her off on a whim.
You have no idea why you sent her off.,Don't do this.
Watch the line.,Deia rei marki. Deia rei marki!
Been looking for you.,Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.
"If they could handle it, they wouldn't be asking for you. Is that a Journal?",Friend wrote an article.
In Hindi?,They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in India. Says so right on the cover Kid's heart rate's a mess.
Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.,I assume the burn unit knew that.
I assume the burn unit knew that.,His potassium's low.
Which can also be explained by the burn.,"Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down."
Could be amphetamines.,Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart; or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.
Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart; or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.,"Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG."
Is he Even going to survive the burn?,"What have you got a date or something? 40% of his body, if the burns unit can prEvent an infection, his body will regenerate maybe 10%, surgeons will do 20 or so grafts, 6 months in this room he'll end up with a series of nasty scars, maybe some pain but he'll live. Unless his heart shuts down because we can't figure out what's causing the low potassium and tachycardia. We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven."
He's dead.,While he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.
Where do we get one?,Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.
"Well, when she gets here, fire her.",Oh yeah!
Did you issue this memo?,Look at that.
"Congratulations, the Patient that has been in a coma for 2 years and counting is still in a coma. This is not my signature; I don't know anything about this guy. I'm supposed to introduce him, have lunch? The coma Patient has a migraine?","Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prEvent a migraine."
"That's a migraine, increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.",I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--
You induced a migraine headache in a coma Patient?!,"Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now."
Have you Even read an ethical guideline?,Well if you are to try out a new migraine prEvention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...
Did you sign this?,Errr... yeah. We can talk later about the appropriate discipline.
Anesthetist get in here.,Who electrocuted my Patient?
He wasn't electrocuted.,What does the seizure tell us? Move.
What are you looking for?,"Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment. Differential diagnosis, go."
"Could be MS, seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.","Well let's find out which, get an MRI."
No nuclear imaging. He wouldn't survive the move to radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.,Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS.
Can't do a lumbar puncture either.,"You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine."
There's no other way to look at a brain.,Transcranial doppler sonography.
"She said brain, not pregnant Woman's uterus. They do sound alike.",I used one to look at a brain this morning.
"Why didn't you take the Patient to radiology, get an MRI?",Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.
You're not going to get a diagnosis of MS from a sonogram!,"Not definitively, but Patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex. Ok then."
"You've nEver been to one of these things in your life, who is this guy?",No idea.
What's with the outfit?,"Sudden Parklls, and light sensitivity. Inexplicable."
Hmm! He must be good. You went to Hopkins and studied under BrightMan and Gilmar.,Shhh...
You were supposed to get the Doyle internship. This guy's von LieberMan?! The guy got you thrown out for cheating?,The Dean threw me out. Von LieberMan just ratted on me.
"This guy's name is Weber, not von LieberMan.",I call him Weber von LieberMan. Way eviler. Shh.
So what's the plan? You going to wait 'til he bends over then make a fart sound?,"I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist."
"Well you cheated off him, how bad can he be?",He got the answer wrong.
Uhh... you stalked this guy for 20 years just for this shot to humiliate him?,Shh! I'm trying to learn.
--vessels without significant rebound.,He doesn't Even know what that means.
"You're going to interrupt him, aren't you?",If I have a question.
And what's that going to accomplish?,Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?
You have got to find less Debilitating outlets than humiliating people! I... hear bowling is more fun than stalking.,But I'm better at this.
We found a subarachnoid bleed.,Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.
There's no way to tell without--,Shut up!
Excuse me?,Not you.
You know if my lecture is interrupting your meeting I can wait.,"Bahut shukriya . As your people say in India, 'preciate it. We'll figure out why later. And fix the bleed or he dies. Talk to you in a couple of hours Teri maa ki"
"And with a P value of less than point zero zero one, we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prEvents migraine headaches without daily administration.",Err... excuse me doctor.
He knows his field better than you do.,"It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prEvent a migraine."
That's why they call it a breakthrough.,That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.
"No, the... err pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough.",I'm sure your wife and Lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?
Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.,"And how exactly did these studies work? You give this drug to a bunch of people and if they don't get a migraine you go ""voila, my drug works""? Erm, excuse me miss, uh do you have cancer? Wow! Mango juice prEvents cancer!"
"We had a very specific control group. Chronic migraine sufferers, I don't have time to go through all the math right now but the incidence was dramatically--","Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?"
Do I know you?,I know your math skills. They blow.
You sound very familiar.,"Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in India? Why not publish it in really, really cool head cases of South Philly?"
Neuroscience New Delhi is a respected journal.,Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.
Get a hooker. Anything.,See I'm thinking that publishing studies is pRobably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach around. And choosing a journal that no one can actually read well that's... that's shrewd.
I know I know you.,Sure you do. Dick.
The name's Phillip.,"Oh, my bad. Something to do with your face. I always think your name is Dick."
House?!,Here.
"Medical school was 20 years ago, give it a rest, grow up.","Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!"
You cheated!,"I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work."
"Oh yes, you would like to beliEve that because it plays right in to your fantasy.",I tested it.
Oh really? What were your parameters? Where's your study?,Room 2134.
"You haven't changed a bit. You took shortcuts in Med school, you're taking shortcuts now. You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.","That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special."
Adam had an orgasm.,What? You mean while he was se--
What's wrong?,I'm having a migraine.
Are you ok?,Hah. Yes. I was right.
It'll knock you out for a couple of hours.,"No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber."
Yeah.,Gotta schedule me some time in there.
Weber's meds aren't Even legal in the US.,It's legal in India. I was disoriented.
Err! moving around is a bad idea. Hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know. Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.,Nothing can hurt my heart.
"Hey you're going to feel some dizziness, definitely going to be constipated.",Differential diagnosis for getting off.
"No, something's seriously wrong with him.",Different diagnosis for ejaculation. Don't make me say that again.
"We're not stalling you, we just don't know.",Then guess.
Could pain medication cause an orgasm?,I wish.
Most people don't orgasm from a needle prick.,"Actually Chase has a point; the brain is like a huge train station. If the switches get-- -- you're the neurologist, talk for me."
"If sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle, it's possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad.",He's a lucky kid. Let's not fix him until the burns heal.
"Crab's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy.",All very bad things. No way to look for any of them in his condition.
"He's on 20 different medications to Manage his pain and his heart, how often he urinates. His brain is like a waiter that's got too Many--",Heyy! I do the metaphors.
"So we just wait for his burns to heal to see if you're right? If you're wrong, he doesn't have that kind of time.",Dominic Larrey.
He another dead doctor?,He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Parkef. Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.
By amputating legs.,And with bugs.
"Maggots eat dead flesh, only dead flesh, so they're perfectly suited to clean wounds. They also kill the bacteria that thrive in injured tissues.",Ohh!
"Dr. Jekyll I presume, they found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo, police wanna ask you a few questions.",Need something to wash it down.
Coffee? Bad idea. You're better off with water.,Coffee's closer.
"Fool-proof plan by the way. Either his meds would work and you'd be in psyParkc pain because von Evil is going to be rich. Or they wouldn't, and you got to be in agony all day. Perfect lose-lose situation. Very you.",I had to prove--
You proved nothing.,Right. This isn't a migraine.
"Yeah. Dear New England Journal of Medicine, I took this guy's drug and still got a headache thus scientifically proving that my archenemy is an idiot. You just wanted the pain.",The meds are supposed to prEvent migraine.
"You get distracted by pain, leaves less room for the things you don't want to think about, like the Flyers sucking or the price of gas or... ohh, the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.","God I wish the pain, would go away."
Did you sleep here?,Lower.
Do you want a pillow?,"Not softer, lower. Frequency of your voice is grating."
You should have been better by now.,I'm super. Patient?
The maggots did great for the burn but the brainwaves are still all over the map.,"Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction, which means there's an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head. Do a lumbar puncture."
We've already established that we can't get a lumbar puncture.,"C2, C3."
"No, no, NO way. I only saw a cervical tap once and that guy got paralyzed.","Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair, or dead."
He doesn't have MS or an infection.,His proteins aren't elevated?
"Wrong protein. IGM, not IGG. Elevation was pRobably caused by the bleed.",What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?
How can you still be on MS?,"I gotta be on something. Something's interrupting his neurons Parktchat, like lesions."
"We can't scan for them, the only test we can do, we just did and it was negative. He has no tingling, no numbness. And you read his history; parents didn't say anything about--",What about Adam?
We can't look into his brain but you want us to read his mind?,Good point.
Good point.,"Yeah, you can finish the sponge bath in a minute."
They're just re-doing his dressings. He's out. He's fine.,I didn't page you to put him out; I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?
I didn't page you to put him out; I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,"Thank you. Come on, I need to talk to him."
"House, you can't wake up a burn victim to play 20 questions. It's torture.",He won't remember.
He's going to be in extraordinary pain!,"God you're good, you're putting me to sleep! I know he's going to be in pain, I know you disapprove, I'm his attending. Wake him up."
Oh my god!,I'm Doctor House.
It hurts!,"It's going to get a lot worse so answer fast. Before the accident did you experience any numbness or tingling in your fingers? You got burned, it's healing. I need an answer!"
It really hurts!,Any tingling in your arms or legs?
Can you do something? I can't..!,Adam! You gotta listen to me! Did you feel anything?
Is he ok?,Get Everyone in my office.
Where are you going?,Kid's screaming gave me a headache. Gotta take an aspirin.
"House, you ok? We've been waiting for you.",I'm hallucinating.
Hallucinations with migraines are pretty uncommon. What did you see?,I saw music.
Sensory deception makes no sense.,Shhh...
Past that. He's seeing sounds. Took something.,"Why's it so dark in here? Beautiful day outside, open the shades, let the sun shine in."
Its night time.,"It's still Tuesday, right?"
You look better.,I took something.
Mind if I ask what?,"Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our Patient, he's depressed."
He told you that when you woke him up?,Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.
"That's not diagnostic of depression. Lack of appetite, isolating yourself--",Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?
Seizure.,Which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least a second seizure.
So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.,"No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine."
Tox screen was clean.,"Yeah, but you know how much crap he's got in his system from dealing with those burns, the guy could have the Spanish Armada floating through his bloodstream and we wouldn't know about it. Until they started firing cannons."
Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms. This is a brain in trouble.,This is a brain with too much serotonin.
"Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it doesn't cause a brain to shut down.","Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do. Every 10 million or so cases, sets off a chain reaction; produces too much, enough to fry itself."
Where are you going?,"Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice."
You can't.,Why? Did he say he doesn't like me?
Anesthesiologist told the parents what you did.,Everyone's a tattletale.
Everyone's a tattletale.,Is your son depressed?
"No, who are you?",I'm doctor House.
I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway!,"If I didn't wake him, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash. We think he had a seizure."
This wasn't my fault?,"Well if he hadn't had the brain pRoblem, he wouldn't have the burns. On the other hand, if you hadn't put him on the ATV, he also wouldn't have the burns. You can Debate your personal responsibility after I leave. I need to wake him up again. I need to know if he's taking antidepressants."
He's the happiest kid I know.,"But you don't know, do you?"
He's my son.,"Hmm... that's sorta my point. At sixteen, they'll tell anyone anything, except their parents."
Adam talks to us about Everything.,"Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine."
There was nEver... cocaine! What!,You sure? Are you having him followed?
He told us when he got drunk at a party; he told us when he started having sex--,Sixteen. Way to go.
He told us when he cheated on a math test; he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him! He doesn't hide anything from us.,But if he was depressed...
"He'd tell us. We don't Judge, he's not depressed, we're sure.",Bet-his-life-on-it sure? Just hypothetically.
Yeah.,Okay.
Okay.,"Kid's happy; happy, happy, happy."
Then we're back to where we started. Seizure disorders.,Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.
Vascular malformations?,Would have seen it on the sonogram.
Hepatic encephalopathy?,Liver enzyme tests were normal.
Where are you going?,To take a leak.
What are you doing?,"Can't come in here, you're not sterile."
"Don't touch our son, we told you!","Seriously, millions of bacteria, micRobes on you. He'll die of sepsis."
I know he is. House! You can't do this!,"Oh if I had a nickel for Every time I've heard that. Relax. Are they going to sue us? If I'm right, I save his life. If I'm wrong, he's dead no matter what I do. Either way, how much have I really hurt them?"
Leave him alone!,You're not sterile; do you want to kill the kid?
Give me the syringe.,"No pain, no gain."
Hey! You gotta stop this!,"They're right, he's not depressed."
"Yeah sure, I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.",What's that on his wrist?
A burn.,Why on his wrist?
Why not on his wrist?,"His back, his torso, Everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there."
So what?,It's a perfect circle.
"So a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist, a screw from the ATV",Maybe.
Why are you torturing him?,Does your son smoke?
I'd kill him.,"So, he talks to you about sex, crack, anything except cigarettes. He has a cigarette burn on his wrist, also a fading nicotine stain between two fingers. Bad news, your son has a filthy, unhealthy habit. Good news, he's trying to quit. Bad news, the quitting is killing him. Good news, I can cure him. Bad news... nope, that's the end of it."
Quitting smoking can kill?,No-smoke meds are antidepressants. Crappy ones you can get over the internet are loaded with whatEver antidepressants they can get cheap. Since mommy and daddy obviously didn't take him to a pediatrician. Sorry I was wrong about him being depressed. Treat him.
"Hey, did you drop acid?",Why would I do that?
"To annoy me, or maybe because you're miserable, or... because you... want to self-destruct. Pick one.",How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks? I'm just saying that's also a possibility. How did you know about it?
Cameron is worried about you. I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours; if you were functional she must be wrong.,"Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it."
Thank you for ruining my clinical trials. Pharmaceutical company is shutting me down.,"You're kidding, really?"
"How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.",I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently loCated--
So what's next? You going to follow me my whole life? Torture me?,Why would I do that?
You waited 20 years to do this. What's next? Break up my marriage?,No. We're Even.
"Right. Oh thanks, for setting me up.","An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants. Everything in balance. Buddhists call it karma and Christians call it the golden rule, Jews call it... I don't know. Rabbi Hillel said something poignant. Universe always settles the score."
Does it?,"No, but it should."
I'm Paula.,Hey Paula.
How you doing? You work over at the college? Or are you full-time over at the--,"I'm looking for a distraction. You don't need to talk to do that, do you?"
How'd you get here?,By osmosis.
No helmet?,Didn't seem like riding weather.
And the fact that you can barely stand upright had nothing to do with it?,Infarctions hurt that's what they do.
"Worsening pain could actually be a good thing, means the nerves might be regenerating.","Could be good, could be bad. Thanks for the differential. Any other options?"
Have you Ever considered a career as a motivational speaker? Why don't you check out some rehab?,I did the rehab thing.
One session and you didn't Even finish that session.,The guy wanted me to visualize the healing. I can do that at home.
At least let me get you an MRI.,"It's a very simple equation; more pain, more pills."
"Teenage super model. Presented with double vision, sudden aggressive behavior, cataple--",You had me at teenage supermodel.
You okay?,Wow you should be a model. Are you really 15?
Who are you?,I'll be the one saving her life today; assuming she's dying. Who are you?
Any idea what's wrong with her?,"From the looks of it, not a single thing. I pRobably should stop staring and check out the file. So what set off the brawl? She stand in your light?"
"Look I know some models are notorious for hissy fits, but Alex, I've nEver Even seen her get angry. Even when she was a kid she was--",I'm sure she was delightful in her youth. And then you passed out.
I was passed out but I wasn't. I... I knew what was going on but I couldn't move or talk.,"Yeah, sounds like a medical thing. It's called cataplexy; cat fight and cataplexy on the catwalk. Cool. How much were you drinking?"
She only had one sip of champagne.,Forget it. We'll find out from the tox screen.
"All right, look, I gave her a valium. You think that's what did this?",No. How long have you had the sweats?
A couple of days.,Any other complaints?
"Uh, my stomachs been bothering me, and I've been feeling a little nauseous.","Okay. Here's how this works; my lackeys will be by shortly to draw some blood, collect some urine, any other fluids you've got, they'll do some other doctorly stuff and we'll be in touch."
Since when do you voluntarily go see Patients?,Have you seen her?
She's fifteen.,"Yeah, but there's something about her. Something in her eyes, a kind maturity."
"Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul. This is creepy Even for you.","She's a fashion model, on the cover of magazines. They hold her up as a sexual ideal; the law says we can't touch her for three more years. How hypocritical is that?"
"Did the history rEveal anything, oh I don't know, medically relevant.","History. Right, knew I was forgetting something. You should do one of those while you're writing the labs and the tox screen."
There's no age limit on addiction.,He's right.
"Or bulimia, or her age. Some girls don't start till their mid to late teens.","Evidence to the contrary; the rounded hips, the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts."
Implants. I've seen some of her photos. They've grow dramatically since last summer.,Symptomatic of turning fourteen. Two clinic hours says that those love apples were hand crafted by God.
I thought you didn't beliEve in God.,I do now.
Could we talk about her health instead of her breasts?,"Could be relevant. Come on Cameron, there's nothing to be ashamed of, Many women dEvelop breasts -- No, I'm fine."
"Even if she is an addict a lot of her symptoms, the cataplexy, the violence, they could be neurological. We chalk this up to drugs we could be releasing her with juvenile MS, or Parkinson's --",Detox her.
Fine. We'll set her up on a program; they'll wean her onto the methadone.,"And in four weeks we'll know you're right. Or we'll know that Cameron's right and the pretty girl will do Milan next fall in a wheelchair. Put her in a coma, pump her full of naltrexone. Cut the four weeks to one night."
You son of a bitch you killed her.,She's not dead.
Get her out of that coma.,I don't think so.
"Stop this. Alright, I! I don't consent anymore. I want to do the slow detox.","Did you Ever get a paper cut? A really nasty one, between the fingers? Multiply that by about a billion and you just barely approach the kind of suffering she'll experience if we wake her up now. We're committed to this. She's out till morning go get a book."
"I haven't slept in weeks, because my teeth hurt. Dentist couldn't find any cavities. And I'm getting these headaches.","Oh, poor you."
"I think I'm going crazy. And my stomach, I roll out of bed and I want to puke.",I take it you're married.
You must be psyParkc.,You must be witty. When's she due?
How'd you know she was--,"Because I'm doing her. You've got couvades syndrome; which is just a fancy way of saying you should stop whining. Millions of women have got the same thing, they're not bugging me. You're suffering from sympathetic pregnancy. Gotta go. People dying. Whole circle of life thing."
It's all in my head?,"No, it's all in your hormones. Good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk."
"Anterograde amnesia, short term memory loss, evidence of a hypoxic brain injury; might be the result of getting cut off from the oxygen when she flat lined. PRobably the result of that rapid detox you told us to push on her. You gonna put that down? You gonna sulk? I'm not gonna indulge you. Treatment for hypoxic brain injuries consist of!","Cameron, Chase and the dark one; Foreman, right? Patient flat lined for like 30 seconds, got to be oxygen deprived for longer than that to lose brain function."
We can't be sure how long she was--,Her brain's fine.
Memory loss. You're saying that's not a neurological symptom?,No. I'm saying what I'm saying. Her brain's fine.
She's faking?,She's got post traumatic stress disorder.
We got models fighting in Iraq now?,Show me a Woman on heroin who looks like that and I'll show you a Woman who's been sexually abused.
That's your proof? That she's good looking?,"He Manages her career, travels the world with her, at her side 24/7; he's either a very good dad or a very bad dad. You saw that tuchas, would the fact that she's your daughter really stop you?"
Oh.,Her brain is running away from reality. When the drugs can't do it anymore it starts to shut down.
Your theory has the advantages of being completely unprovable and completely exculpating you.,"When you guys are done talking do an MRI and an LP; when her brain checks out as normal then we'll know that daddy really, really loves her."
Why would your mind go to abuse so fast?,I had a funny uncle.
I don't know if it has something to do with this case or if you have something personal going on. The whole break up thing--,It's personal.
House. Your pain is affecting your decision making.,"You got a pRoblem with a call I make, question the call don't make it personal."
Are you saying pain can't affect your mood? If I'm right about the pain you're going to want to rush Everything; which is what you're doing. Don't.,Thank you. Are you doing your daughter?
What?,"We should pRobably talk privately huh, come on, walk with me."
I'm not.,He's not. Sure he's not. She is a babe though.
I should take your head off.,"Your glands are fine. So now you're my Patient. You've got doctor-Patient confidentiality, no worries. So what did you do to her?"
How could you possibly think?,Hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her.
You son of a--,"It's a compliment. The heart shaped ass, those perfect perky all natural breasts."
That is my daughter you're talking about.,"No, that's your daughter you were talking about. 'She just instinctively knows how to walk. Designers just love that heart shaped ass, those perfect perky--'"
I'm her Manager I have to promote her.,"Oh, that makes sense. So you compartmentalize. When you're dealing with the press you're her Manager. When you're helping with homework you're her dad. When you're making sweet, sweet love you're her Manager."
All right.,Do you love her?
I nEver touched her.,Do you love her?
What are you doing? Trying to trap me into saying--,"Do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her? Psychological conditions can Manifest themselves in physical pRoblems. Sometimes these can be extreme enough to kill. There are treatments, but only if there's a diagnosis. Are you going to admit that you slept with your daughter or are you just gonna let her die?"
One time.,PTSD. Get her a psych referral and pack her bags. He did her.
Don't think so.,"Daddy thinks so. Could be mistaken, said he was drunk, could be some other daughter."
We have to call Parkld protective services.,Doctor-Patient confidentiality.
"Doesn't apply in abuse cases, you know that. We're Mandated to report sexual abuse.",Is it okay if I save her life first or do you want to make sure daddy doesn't get visitation rights to the grave site?
So we're just gonna leave a Parkld molester in the same room as his victim?,"It's got windows. Fine, arrest him. Use Cuddy's handcuffs."
If you're too distracted to deal with this because your leg hurts.,"Yeah, I'm distracted. I'm all hung up on this fifteen year old Patient who's cataplectic, can't remember what she had for lunch and is rapidly losing control of her body. And I want her father here in case they've got any more secrets that I need to know about. Now, if you're not too distracted go take out a piece of her brain and stick it under a microscope. Wilson!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you really think we need to jump straight to brain biopsy?","No, lets keep playing pin the diagnosis on the supermodel until she's dead."
Heard you killed your supermodel.,Only for a minute.
Just for my own clarity. How Many more Patients do you have to kill before you admit this leg thing just might be a pRoblem?,Three. I need your help.
Find a way to kick up the contribution. What did House do now?,"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?"
"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?",You'll have to check with Cameron.
House.,"Quick, God, smite the evil witch!"
Are you sitting on evidence that your Patient was sexually abused by her father?,"God, why have you forsaken me?"
MRI looks exactly the same as it did two years ago. Nerves don't seem to be regenerating.,I figured as much.
SEveral researchers have proven that psychological pain can Manifest as physical pain.,You think I have a conversion disorder? You want me to see a shrink.
"Brilliant idea, sending Stacey away, it's really done wonders for you.",Listen none of this has anything to do with Stacey.
"Right; giant coincidence that you've gone completely off the rails since she left; inducing migraines, worsening leg pain-- Ow!",Aw. You miss Stacey too?
Brain biopsy shows no white matter disease.,"Cameron, you going to tell Cuddy or has she already got you wired for sound?"
I had to do what I thought was right.,"So white is out, that just leaves grey."
Am I in trouble?,You had to do what you thought was right. They call it grey area because you nEver really know what's there. We can't test for any of those things.
So I'm not in trouble.,"You can torture yourself all you want. What if Everything we're seeing, is just smoke signals."
Okay. Who's sending them?,"Tumor. If she has cancer anywhere in her body, she could also have paraneoplastic syndrome which could be causing antibodies to attack her brain. Antibodies are stupid that way."
Paraneoplastic syndrome is awfully rare in a fifteen year old.,"Fifteen year olds who look like that are awfully rare. It would explain the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy, the memory loss, Even the twitParkng. It's perfect."
What if it's not? We could waste weeks searParkng for a tumor that we don't Even know is there.,Then let's make sure it is there.
There's no test for paraneoplastic syndrome.,"Sure there is, the squeeze the tube test."
It wasn't definitive.,But the twitParkng should stop right about now.
Oh my god.,Could've just been a coincidence. TwitParkng does tend to stop and start. Let's be sure. The IVIG vacuums her blood neutralizes the stuff that's making her twitch. It's actually kind of cool. I wonder if could make you dance.
This is unbelievable. You did it. You fixed her.,"No, all I did was prove that she has cancer."
"No, all I did was prove that she has cancer.",I need a favor.
I'm not in a giving mood.,It'll help us both. I need a shot of morphine in my spine.
"If your leg hurts, take your vicodin.",It's not enough. Get a syringe.
"Morphine is extreme, Even for you.","Yeah, write that on the insert."
Get one of your lackeys to do it.,I don't want them knowing.
That you're on the road to becoming a junkie?,That I'm in this much pain. I don't want them questioning my judgment. I can't ask Wilson because he figures its all in my head.
"Well, I agree with him. I'm going home.","Well, what about this?"
What are you doing?,Is this in my head? Cause I could swear I remember a thigh muscle being here.
I'll get a syringe.,It's gotta be cancer.
It's not cancer. You seem to be back to your old miserable self.,"So I just randomly predicted she'd respond to IVIG? Her twitches are gone, her memory's getting better."
What did you take?,"If the increased pain's psychological, no drugs gonna help."
If you thing it'll help the drugs will help. Power of the mind.,"You're right. The more I talk to you, the more the pain floods back. Knew the twins were real. Chase owes me. You check the pancreas?"
"Oh come on, you're just making up organs now aren't you. We checked the pancreas. Obviously you've taken something.","You check the bones? There are a lot if bones, I think."
And none of them have cancer.,Ovaries?
"There's no mass, if anything they're undersized. No leukemia. No Hodgkin's. We checked Everything. Unless they've invented a new organ, it's not cancer.",Differential diagnosis.
It's gotta be cancer. There's gotta be something we missed.,You gotta learn to let go Foreman.
If it was PTSD the twitParkng wouldn't have magically disappeared when we started the IVIG.,"Wrong. What it wouldn't have done was medically disappear, nothing to stop it from magically disappearing. She was watParkng me start and stop the medicine."
You think she's faking?,"Not consciously, but if her subconscious is trying to get away from it all cancer's got to be a lovely vacation spot. Tell her you've got to give her a fresh IV. Don't tell her you're starting her on saline. See if the twitParkng comes back."
Help me.,How did you get my pager number?
Please.,PRoblem is if I give you an epidural you won't be able to feel when to push.
You're not funny.,Pretty sure I am. You just can't appreciate it because you're in pain.
"George, if you don't get off your ass and help me.",Oh shut up! You've got yourself the perfect Man; a Woman. He's got more estrogen coursing through his veinsï¿½
Oh shut up! You've got yourself the perfect Man; a Woman. He's got more estrogen coursing through his veinsï¿½,Who did her vaginal exam?
I did,Did she have hair?
What are you getting at?,Right now I'm getting at whether or not she had hair down there.
Uh! not much.,"She's Manipulative, yet completely docile. Everybody tells us that outburst on the catwalk was out of character. She's nEver had a period."
You're thinking this is hormonal?,I'm thinking she's the ultimate Woman. I! I need to schedule an MRI.
The twitParkng stopped.,Because we changed your medicine back to the real stuff. Stop talking.
You gave me fake medicine?,That's what I said; in the vain hope that you wouldn't feel the need to also say it. Stop talking.
"Wilson already did an ultrasound, said her ovaries were undersized.",The ultrasound would be the way to go if you were looking for ovarian cancer.
What are we looking for?,That.
Oh my God.,Looks like a tumor doesn't it?
But those are.,Yep.
Yep.,We found a tumor.
She has cancer.,"Technically, no."
So its not cancer?,"No, it's cancer. But, he has cancer, on his left testicle."
She's not a guy.,"His DNA says you're wrong. Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. You've got male pseudohermaphroditism. See we all start out as girls and then we're differentiated based on our genes. The ovaries dEvelop into testes and drop. But in about 1 in 150,000 pregnancies a fetus with an XY chromosome, a boy, dEvelops into something else. Like you. Your testes nEver descended because you're immune to testosterone. You're pure estrogen, which is why you get heightened female characteristics; clear skin, great breasts. The ultimate Woman is a Man. Nature's cruel, huh?"
"This is obviously a joke, this is impossible.","No, a joke would be me calling you a homo. See the difference? I'll schedule him for surgery."
"No, you're wrong. I'm a girl. Look at me! How could you say I'm not a girl? See! They're all looking at me. I'm beautiful!","Anger, it's just the cancer talking. Put your clothes back on. I'm going to cut your balls off. Then you'll be fine."
How's the Patient.,Post op. I sent him slash her up for a psyche visit.
Calling her him slash her isn't really helping.,"Good news is, I don't think dad's going to be sleeping with him slash her again. See, now it's gross. I need another shot."
When did the pain start coming back?,A few hours ago.
About an hour after you solved the case.,If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.
Same dosage?,"If you would be more comfortable, I might be able to deal with a few CC's less morphine."
It wasn't morphine.,What did you give me? I told you I wanted--
His right testicle is almost twice as big as his left.,Cool.
It's pRobably testicular cancer.,No. That's impossible.
The symptoms all indiCate--,"The shoes aren't right. Here's how testicular cancer would Manifest itself. First the Patient would get the exact symptoms that he's got, then Foreman would examine him, then he'd suspect testicular cancer on the count of the symptoms being so perfect, then he'd stick a needle in it, then he'd call a surgeon. And while that guy operates, the rest of us would be out bowling. And since we're not wearing bowling shoes, the disease obviously did not progress in that fashion."
"LP showed some white cells, but his MRI is clean.","Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain ""clean""."
"Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain ""clean"".",What you don't trust me?
Are you talking about the left temporal lobe?,Neat! You can see through my hand!
It's just a shadow.,"Or it's an infection. When guys have brain-crotch pRoblems, it's usually the result of using one too much and the other too little."
"Blood and urine were negative for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlAmydia.",So treat him for all 3. Stat.
Umm... negative means he doesn't have it.,"No, negative means he pRobably doesn't have it, which means he pRobably has cancer."
I thought we were wearing the wrong shoes for cancer.,"We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma. Except Chase's, they're just goofy."
"We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma. Except Chase's, they're just goofy.","Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain. If it does advance he's dead no matter what we do. So give him the STD meds, and hope the tests were wrong."
"Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain. If it does advance he's dead no matter what we do. So give him the STD meds, and hope the tests were wrong.",Spinook. Who's the lucky Woman?
My wife.,"No, I don't want to know who gets the chocolates; I want to know who you're having the affair with."
"Fell on his head as a Parkld, tragic.","Norwegian chocolate. Frankly, you buy that stuff the terrorists win."
"Some people bottle up their feelings, have them come out as physical pain. Healthy huMan beings express feelings such as affection by giving gifts.","Gifts express guilt. The more expensive the expression, the deeper the guilt. That's a 12 dollar box so that means you haven't slept with her yet, or she wasn't that good."
"It's not all about sex, House.",Really? When did that change?
I wanna get depo provera.,"Actually, at your age, as long as you're careful, the risk of you getting pregnant is pretty limited."
"Yeah but it would calm me down, right? If I get a high enough dose.",You mean calm as in... peaceful lake on a cool summer Evening? Or in the lesser used meaning of nothing can Ever bother you again because life has absolutely no meaning? High dose of depo provera will chemically castrate you.
Yeah.,"Ok... I'm going to get up to leave now. I'm going to walk to that door, turn the handle, and then you're suddenly going to decide that you have to tell me the truth. I'm going to have to turn around and come all the way back. You see the thing is, my leg hurts. Can we cut the walking out of the equation?"
I love cows.,Any particular variety? Guernseys? Holstein?
Which are the black and white ones?,Oh god.
"I pass a farm on my way to school. And they're so beautiful. They're so majestic I dream about them. Leather shoes, hamburgers. How can anybody do that to a cow?","Make love, not belts. Beautiful."
I haven't actually--,"Oh relax; it's something we doctors deal with all the time. And I'm going to write you the name of a drug, you don't need a prescription and looks just like depo provera."
But does it do the same thing?,"Oh god no. That stuff has all sorts of nasty side effects. It's real medicine. Now this is all you need, your frat buddies will be completely fooled. You tell them how appalling the doctor was, lots of laughs."
I have not had sex since my divorce.,I didn't ask him to take the medicine; I asked you do give him the medicine.
He hasn't had sex in over a year.,He's lying.
He knows what's at stake. We should start treating him for lymphoma right away. Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--,Wilson! How long can you go without sex?
How long can you go without annoying people?,"No seriously, a week? A month?"
I'm not having an affair.,I didn't say you were. Not in this conversation. I'm talking about a Patient!
"People have impulse control, we don't NEED sex.","Well not like air, but as a biological imperative, sure we do. There's two things we get stupid for - money and sex, and since money rarely enters the bloodstream. Was his daughter in the room when you asked if he had sex?"
"I told him we could talk privately, he didn't care if she was there.","It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me."
"It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me.",Lunch is early huh?
Lunch is early huh?,"Hi, I'm doctor House. I hear you'd rather die than admit you had sex."
I'm sorry I... couldn't tell my daughter.,"Right, coz she's what? 22?"
I slept with her mom.,She pRobably knows that's happened already. Roll over.
"My wife had an affair, I forgave her. She had another affair and I forgave her again and... Amy thinks I was an idiot.",So smart. You must be very proud. Roll over.
I assume that you've been in love.,Is that the one that makes you pants feel funny? I'm starting you on a cocktail of STD meds.
Amy is just getting over it. She barely spoke to her mom for months and if she thought that it was happening again and that's why I got sick... We... we just happened to be at the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.,Cheese is the devil's plaything.
It was just the one night.,Well you're obviously completely over her.
Amy thinks love leads you to make stupid choices.,You're certainly setting a good example for her.
How's that possible?,He met a Woman in church.
Does she...?,Crash cart!
Is this another seizure?,Shut up.
Here you go,40 milligrams Knock him out.
How would an STD do this?,It wouldn't.
It's not an STD. Lymphoma wouldn't erupt that suddenly.,"So what is it? A disease that attacks his brain, heart and testicles. I think Byron wrote about that."
Wouldn't mess with the reproductive system. Maybe things aren't so nicely connected. He's 65. We could be looking at multiple systems just starting to break down independently.,Way to a Man's heart is through his stomach.
He's had acid reflux for years. It can't be relevant.,Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them.
Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them.,"You don't need this so much. PRoblem is not your lungs, it's your heart. That Italian cheese thing at the church - what sort of cheese?"
Why do you need to know?,I'm having a fondue party. Was it sheep cheese?
Might have been. Why?,Was it soft?
Yeah.,Taste like crap?
Uhh... yeah. Bitter.,Taste like this?
Yeah. But... how did you?,That was regular low fat American. I added some bacteria for flavour.
You fed him bacteria?,"It's pretty much on Everything. Especially the unpasteurised sheep cheese they make in the Alps. That stuff will give you brucellosis. Key to a long life - exotic women, and boring cheese. I'm going to start you on rifampin and doxycycline."
"Doesn't make any sense. I mean nobody else at the ""church"" got sick.","99.9% of ""Christians"" have so much acid in their stomach they become churning cauldrons of death for all those nasty brucellosis bugs. But you were taking antacids for your acid reflux, so that turns your digestive tract into a pleasant scenic river for all those bacterial tourists."
You sure you're right?,"Absolutely. Your socks don't match, which means you got out dressed in the dark, which means you don't want to wake your wife which means you don't want to talk to her, which means--"
I was referring to your Patient.,"Oh that. No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese!"
How long before you get the tests back?,"We'll know before that. If I'm wrong, he'll just keep getting worse and slowly die. And if I'm right, either we caught it in time he gets better, or we didn't and he goes into cardiac arrest at any moment."
"Paddles! Charging. 250. Clear! Charging, 300. Clear! Charging, 360. Clear! Epinephrine.",Are you going to tell her?
"That you suspect an affair? Sure. She already hates you, why not?",Because you think that getting it off your chest will let you sleep better. It won't. You'll end up sleeping on my lumpy couch.
There's nothing to tell.,Why are you playing foosball here at 8 o' clock at night?
"You always want to simplify Everything. Boil it down to nice, easy equations, nice easy answers.",Go home and have sex with your wife.
His heart muscle's half-dead. He'll be lucky to last a week.,"Other than that, how's he doing? Seriously. His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils. How's all that other stuff doing?"
"Uhh his brain is clear now, and so is the genital and urinary tract and his kidney function is good.","So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here."
"So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here.","He's a prime candidate for transplant. Doesn't smoke. Drinks moderately. His tox screen is negative for illegal drugs, and legal ones. Surveillance blood culture show absolutely no sign of any lingering brucella bacteria."
He's 66-yrs-old.,Told me he was 65. Liar. I'm out of here.
There is an inverse correlation between Patient age and success rates.,"He's in excellent health. This was his first hospitalisation since breaking his leg at 23. Or 22, I'm not sure anymore."
"If this Patient were to survive the operation, he'd get another what? 5, 10, maybe 20 years if he's very lucky?",So you're saying that old people aren't as worth saving as young people?
He's saying that hearts are a scarce resource. We obviously have to choose criteria--,"No I get it; women live longer so they should get preference, right? The African-Americans, they die a lot younger so to hell with them."
What you think you're going to win me over by calling me a racist?,"If the test is who gets to use it the longest, you can either be a racist or a hypocrite."
Your Patient had a life. A family. We've got 18-yr-old kids who only--,"How old are you, doctor? When do we get to toss you on an ice flow?"
"And thank you doctor House. Unless anybody else has any further questions, we will now go into private session.",Oh I'm on pins and needles. I wonder how you'll decide.
I wrote a letter to the Board of Directors appealing the Transplant Committee's decision. I'm alleging bias against you clouded their medical Judgement. I need you to sign.,They made the right call.
You don't beliEve that. You told the committee--,I was advocating for my Patient.
Then why are you--,Advocating for my Patient. I gotta go clinic duty. I need you to get me the files on Everybody who dies here today.
You really think this thing will change their decision?,Nope!
Nope!,Moooo!
I think I broke my ankle. I was kicked by a hoof. I'm so in love. She was so beautiful.,Which one?
"One of the black and white ones, I'm not sure what type--","Not which type, which one? I want a name."
Why would it have a name?,"Not ""it"", she. Or he. I wanna know her dreams, her hopes."
It's a cow.,"Hey, I'm not the one who said he was in love. People who actually have this condition rationalise it, they dismiss it, they don't elevate it to the lEvel of poetry. Plus there's a wooden splinter in there. So either you hit yourself with a 2 by 4 or Elsie has a pick leg. I'm off duty at 6, give yourself another whack and come back and scam somebody else."
"I'm sick. And you're a doctor, you have a duty to help me.",Technically I don't have to treat anybody before running a series of painful and often humiliating tests.
90-yr-old Woman died of pneumonia.,Unless she has a bionic heart. What's next?
"Umm... baby, died in the ICU.","Babies are useless, they got hearts the size of ping-pong balls. Next."
Err... 40-yr-old male.,Yes?
Heart attack.,"If you really cared about me, you'd find me a better corpse."
No other deaths. There's one Woman who was in a car accident.,Bad one I hope.
Don't think the procurement people have been notified.,Give me her file.
It's in the ER; they're still looking on her.,Age?
Not 40.,"Young, damn."
Young is good.,Smoker?
Don't know.,Find out.
"She's still alive. Even if we get on the list, we can't go near her.",Overweight?
She's on the hefty side.,Excellent. Our odds just went up.
What odds? What is this?,"60% of potential donor hearts get tossed in the trash because there's something wrong with them. With fat people, it's closer to 80."
But if her heart's no good then--,Big fat sloppy heart beats no heart all
Big fat sloppy heart beats no heart all,Are you Mr Neuberger?
Yes.,I'm Doctor House. Need to ask you a few questions about your wife.
Is she going to be ok?,I'm afraid I don't know that. Could you tell me about her accident?
"They think she fell asleep, went off the road, that's all they told me.",Any pRoblems with her health until now?
Why?,Police say it's important.
Erm... she had a fEver today but otherwise she was--,How high?
101. She hasn't missed a day of teaParkng in... years. And I should have made her stay home.,Any other symptoms?
"I... I'm sorry, I thought umm... she was just pronounced dead , I thought he was telling you.",I didn't know. Shouldn't have made assumptions.
What did you want from me?,"I'm sorry for your loss, but I need your wife's heart."
The Organ Procurement Coordinator just left the hospital.,"Means we got lucky, either that or she's getting lunch. Dead Woman's last name have a 'u' or a 'w'?"
You're hacking into a confidential Patient file?,Is that a pRoblem for you?
It's a 'u'. N - E - U.,Three minutes ago... her organs were officially declared not viable. Time to go dumpster diving.
"Hey, she's got Hepatitis C, her ALTs are three times normal. With Henry's immune system down, an infected heart will kill him.","Fortunately, she didn't have Hep C."
She tested positive.,"Her history says otherwise. Her husband told me she was running a fEver with stomach pains, not symptomatic of Hep C."
Hey what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?!,"Again, sorry. But we need to talk."
Mr Neuberger has Every right to take his wife off the ventilator.,His wife signed an organ donor card.
Which became invalid when her organs were turned down.,"I can use them! I just need some time! Committee says they won't take her heart. Another committee says a guy can't have a heart. It's a marriage made in heaven. I can find a surgical team that can do this. Classify it as experimental, it's not going to screw with any numbers. This is what she wanted; she wanted her organs to help another--"
She nEver wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator.,"She's not, she's dead! She's not in pain, she's not suffering. It's just her... meat we're dealing with here."
This is my wife.,Not anymore.
She deserves some respect. Some dignity.,I respect the living.
"Right, that is why you made me think that you were her doctor. Made me beliEve that maybe there was some hope.",I nEver said that I was her doctor.
Nicely played.,It's not over.
I'm Amy Arrington. I wanted to thank you.,This girl's father will die by next weekend unless he gets your wife's heart.
"House, don't you think that's a little Manipulative?","No, it's hugely Manipulative."
You're an ass.,"Hey listen, you take your wife off life support, and I'll have forgotten about this in two weeks. Gale here on the other hand--"
Amy.,"WhatEver. You're mad at me, fine I get that, take it out on me, not on her."
Fine. Your dad can err... have her heart.,"FEver, stomach pain, raised liver enzymes."
She's sick.,"Worse than that, she's dead."
"My point is, Even if it's not Hep C, it's something. They turned it down as a donor because if we put that heart into someone, they won't survive. WhatEver made her sick will kill him.",Yeah. So what is it? Enzymes indiCate--
You want us to do a differential diagnosis on a dead person?,We're going to cure her.
We're going to cure death?,MWAHAHAHAHA. Doubt it. Just want to get the infection out of her heart before we get the heart out of her. The fEver indiCates an infection.
She pRobably has Hep C and a bad case of the flu.,"Let's assume, just for fun, that the answer is something that might be helpful."
FEver and belly pain. Could be a gall bladder infection.,"Like that. Do an MRI, stat."
Perfectly round. Now Hep C would explain--,"Question was nEver is it Hep C? Question was given that it's not Hep C, what is it?"
Not vascular enough.,What if she was sloppy about washing her hands after pooping?
Err... ameba infection?,"The amebias started in her liver and spread to her blood, that would explain all her symptoms. Except for the crushed skull but I'm assuming that's from the car crash."
I'll start her on paromycin and chloroquine.,10 grams each.
That's... 20 times the normal dose.,Right. So we'll destroy her retinas and damage her hearing. WhoEver wants those parts is having a very bad day. Couple of hours on the meds and she'll be feeling great.
Right. So we'll destroy her retinas and damage her hearing. WhoEver wants those parts is having a very bad day. Couple of hours on the meds and she'll be feeling great.,Got your labs. Do you eat guinea pigs?
No.,How about hamsters? Or mice? HuMans?
What are you talking about? Is something wrong with me?,"Absolutely nothing. Blood work is perfect. You got lots of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of proteins. Including a little something I like to call 'bovine serum albumin' which you get from eating the animals mentioned. Or cow. You don't really worship cows. So I have to wonder, what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical."
"Absolutely nothing. Blood work is perfect. You got lots of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of proteins. Including a little something I like to call 'bovine serum albumin' which you get from eating the animals mentioned. Or cow. You don't really worship cows. So I have to wonder, what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical.",Nice.
It's my mom.,Well either that's a very old photograph or it's your step mom.
"She goes around the House in a bikini. Or less. I... I can't stop thinking about her. My dad's in Europe. I... I'll be watParkng TV, she'll give me a massage, I can't walk for an hour.",Still. Cows.
She's my mother!,Step.
Please? I just need the medicine for 3 months until I graduate and I move out of the House. Please.,You're not going to have any fun at graduation.
You're not going to have any fun at graduation.,Keep up the good work. Your shirt is ironed. That means you haven't told your wife anything.
Let's say you're right.,You're saying I'm right?
No. Let us say. Does it occur to you that maybe there's some deeper guidance than keep your mouth shut? That maybe a friend might value concern over glibness? That maybe... maybe I'm going through something that I need to have an actual conversation about?,"Does it occur to you that if you need that kind of a friend, that you may have made some deeper errors."
Her heartbeat's irregular. Looks like global hypokinesis.,Stop the meds.
Are you giving up?,"Either we're wrong, and our heart is unusable, or we're right, but the treatment we have to give her will make her heart unusable. I'm sorry. You can pull the plug now. Find me another body. That fat guy on the other end of the service didn't look so hot."
No! She's not ready.,You were ready this morning.
She's not done. She's gotta save that guy.,Alternate theories?
Amebiasis was our best hope. The fact that her heart rate went back to normal when we stopped the meds pretty much--,What's our second best hope?
Maybe we should just biopsy it.,"She's a fridge with the power out. We start poking around inside, the vegetable goes bad. No offence."
Her err... toxin screen was clean.,"Those things nEver cover for any of the really cool toxins. Run the screen again for... whatEver you can think of. You keep the other Patient alive, you check out her school, and I seem to need to hire another doctor to go search her home. Come on."
"If she was taking any medications, I'd know about it.",Does your wife dye her hair?
"No. Her mom nEver went grey, she didn't either.","Guess this must be yours then. Can you think of anything else she might have lied to you about? Any drugs she ""gave up"" when she married you?"
"His heart's not pumping enough blood to his brain, we're going to have to give him some help. Get the balloon ready.",Do you use this drawer?
"No, that's for her vitamins.",And sleeping pills.
She nEver took sleeping pills.,Ok. You on a diet?
No. I guess you nEver really know someone do you?,"Quite the insight. She lied to you about her hair colour, and didn't want you to know she thought she was fat. Unless you nEver lied to her about anything that huge, I think you can pRobably let those slide."
Diet pills could have messed her up. Raised her liver enzymes and caused the belly ache.,But not the fEver.
Maybe something else set off the fEver.,Like what?
"Before I show you these, they were in a locked drawer in her desk, the vice principal said that Laura must have confisCated them, they've had some pRoblems--",Neither interesting nor helpful. This at least is interesting.
No it's not.,Sex with teenagers isn't interesting? Where did you grow up?
It isn't helpful. Teenage boys aren't toxins.,What if the cyst isn't a cyst?
Then we have nothing to go on.,"I said it's not a cyst, I didn't say it was nothing. What if it's a scar?"
Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome? Pushing gonorrhea again?,You have anything better? Test her. Then start her on ceftriaxone.
She's positive for gonorrhea!,I think that's the first time those words have been uttered in joy.
He's in a coma.,Start him on dobutamine.
"House, she's still got a significant amount of gonorrhea in her system.","Hopefully tomorrow, it'll be in his system. I need two ORs and the transplant team."
I assume this means that you found out what was wrong with Laura?,She... had amebiasis. We just found a different way to get rid of it.
That was kind of you.,"I didn't want him going postal on us. Soon as his wife's heart's in our hands, you can tell him about the gonorrhea. He's gotta be tested. Preferably before he gets any sympathy sex."
Could I stay with you for a few days?,You idiot. You told her.
"She told me. Things have been crappy at home lately, I figured I wasn't spending enough time with her. I figured... Turns out you're right, it's always about sex. She's been having an affair.",Want a beer?
"Yes, we need an ambulance at 10600 Xavier, here in 4B, my husband can't breathe! Oh my God, he's turning blue, you have to send someone now, please! Hurry!",You blow dry your hair?
"Oh, sorry, did I wake you up?",You blow dry your hair?!
Excuse me for actually caring what I look like.,I think the word you're looking for is obsessing. You've been at it for almost an hour.
"If you wanted in, all you had to do is say so.","I don't want in, I want sleep!"
"It's about time you got up anyway, it's almost 9:00.",This isn't gonna work.
What?,You. Staying here.
You're kicking me out? After one night?,"You think we should try counseling first? Why d'you want to sleep on a couch, anyway? You've got money. At least until the divorce is finalized."
What were you doing?,"Awesome, a sex fiend with a swollen tongue. Just think of all the places I can make Foreman search."
He's not a sex fiend; he's a happily married Man.,No such thing.
What are you doing?,Testing a new caffeine delivery system.
"I didn't see any sign of trauma, and they were remarkably open. I asked about STDs and they admitted participating in a threesome a few months ago.",A hundred bucks says they're as miserable as the next couple.
"If he's not happily married, I don't know who could be.","You're looking for something. If you're happy, you've got nothing to look for."
"His wife arranged it for an anniversary present. If you ask me, if two people really trust each other, a threesome once Every sEven years might actually help a marriage.","Okay, I say we stop the DDX and discuss that comment."
"No, ALS would affect his facial muscles before his throat.",What if the pRoblem's not in his throat?
That would be a little odd considering that's where all his symptoms are.,Says who?
The Patient.,"Since most Patients can't tell their ulna from their anus, I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know the difference between choking and suffocating. His throat might be fine, his lungs might be messed up. Get more blood, a chest CT and a body plethysmograph. Unless, of course, you think we should be asking the Patient where his anus is, first."
"It feels like I have to urinate, and then when I try to go!",Pull up your pants.
"It's my prostate, isn't it?","Nope, not your prostate. Herpes."
Herpes?,"Herpes. Your turn. If it makes you feel any better, half the Patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot."
"No, it doesn't. Look, this is impossible. I've been married for 20 years.",Had any sex in those 20 years?
"Yes, of course ""ï¿½",Then that's how you got it.
The only person I've had sex with is my wife.,"Bummer. Take this, once a day. Tell your wife to do the same. It's not going to cure it, but it'll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks."
"But there must be some mistake ""ï¿½",You got any kids?
Yeah.,Any of them take guitar lessons?
No!,"Tennis, art, acting?"
"My daughter does karate, why?","Give this to her sensei. Oh, wait, does your wife play tennis?"
No.,That's what I figured. It nEver hurts to make sure. For Miyagi.
Cause could be idiopathic.,"Can't be idiopathic. Idiopathic means ""without a known cause.""ï¿½"
"What I meant was that ""ï¿½","What you meant was you don't know what the cause is, just say that and we can avoid this conversation. No applause? What's his current condition?"
Stable.,Then we can wait.
Wait for what?,For whatEver you can't figure out to cause something else. You know it's going to.
"Stop, stop, make it stop! [CGI inside of his hives, which look quite nasty.","Now we've got something to discuss. What causes both lung scarring and the itchy, red blotches?"
"It's obviously not a reaction to medication, you haven't given him any yet.","Right, but what besides what's obviously not caused both the lung scarring and the splotches?"
Where are you going?,"To complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system. Either talk loud or get in here. Same color coming out as going in ""ï¿½ think that's a marketing thing?"
We've already ruled out allergies.,Did we? Where's Cameron?
We're in the men's room.,Need an allergy expert in here!
This can wait two minutes.,You don't know that. Chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table.
"Yeah, and some homeopathic studies have also found that ground-up spiders can cure cancer. Can I go now?","No. Lungs, skin. Skin, lungs. Sklungs? Lungs, skin. Throat. Heavy metal toxicity. It explains the lungs, the itParkng, the swelling in the tongue and throat."
I thought you didn't beliEve there was anything wrong in his throat.,I nEver said I didn't beliEve it. I just said I had good reason to doubt it.
And now?,Now I have good reason to doubt those doubts.
He and his wife worked a wedding in Cabo San Lucas. A lot of pottery in Mexico is contaminated with lead-based paint.,"Now aren't you glad you joined us? Search their House, and screen his hair and blood for lead. And test for mercury and arsenic while you're at it. Chase, find out what the resort cooks with, if they've repainted recently or did any plumbing repairs."
I don't speak Spanish.,Then it'll be challenging.
Then it'll be challenging.,"Good Lord, what is that smell?"
Stuffed pepper.,Stuffed with what? Vomit? I thought you were going to a hotel.
I found an apartment. I can move in on Monday. Is that fast enough for you?,What's today? Where'd you get all that stuff?
"Well, not from your kitchen. Don't you Ever eat anything besides canned soup and peanut butter?",Don't you Ever eat anything that doesn't look like it's been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle?
"Try it. It's good, isn't it?",No. Just better than it looks. How much beans and rice d'you think you'd have to eat from a ceramic pot painted with lead-based paint to get enough lead in your system to damage your lungs?
Are we talking a Parkld or an adult?,Adult.
"Then I'd say a lot. You'd have to eat beans Every day for months. Now, why do you have a season pass to ""The New Yankee Workshop""ï¿½?","It's a complete moron working with power tools ""ï¿½ how much more suspenseful can you get?"
I was watParkng something!,"No, you're about to watch something. I'm watParkng something. See the difference."
"Yeah, I can tell.",You think ants are the pRoblem?
Can you stop stuffing your mouth with pancakes for one second?,These aren't pancakes. These are macadamia nut pancakes. Wilson made them and they're amazing.
"She says she doesn't use bug spray ""ï¿½",Little silver dollar slices of heaven.
"Some ants are poisonous. Maybe ""ï¿½","Forget the 72 virgins. If I blow myself up in a crowded restaurant, I think I'm asking for a plate of these babies. Was the ant small and red or big and black?"
Big and brown.,Halle Berry brown or Beyonce brown?
Is there a difference?,"Is there a difference. Army ants could devour, dissolve, eat a cow in a matter of hours. Australian bull ants, on the other hand, are nasty little bastards, but more of a nuisance than a threat. No surprise there."
Beyonce.,"Well then, that's not it. How much clay did he eat at the resort?"
"It's a five-star, $400 a night place, they don't cook with ceramic pots.",Tox screen?
"No evidence of lead, mercury or arsenic.","Run them again. Call the resort, find some disgruntled employee to talk to. Go back to the home ""ï¿½"
It's not heavy metals!,The symptoms say it is.
The tests say it's not.,"Well, who're you gonna beliEve? The symptoms or the test?"
It could also be a food allergy.,Cameron says it's not.
"Which I assume he eats with milk, one of the most common adult onset food allergies.","Start treating him for lead poisoning, it's the most likely heavy metal. And yeah, you can test him for allergies for dairy, wheat, and legume."
Means there's a neurological pRoblem.,"More significantly, it's yet another classic sign of heavy metals."
"Lupus could cause ""ï¿½","No. Lupus progresses slower, there'd be joint pain."
"So it's not a typical case! We should get an ANA ""ï¿½",It's not lupus! The symptoms don't match.
"His urine has elevated proteins and red blood cells. It's lupus-induced kidney failure. If we don't start treatment ""ï¿½",Heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting.
So would lupus nephritis! And it also causes tissue swelling.,"He's choking on his tongue, not his feet."
The corticosteroids we gave him should control the inflammation and can cause facial swelling.,"Still not his throat, but you're getting closer."
I'm doing an ANA and a serum complement.,"If you're so sure, why waste time with tests? Start treatment. Oh no, wait, you can't do that, because we already have and it's not working, ergo ""ï¿½"
Cortical steroids aren't the only treatment for lupus nephritis! We can also try cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressants!,"Only if we confirm the diagnosis with an ANA, serum complement, anti-DNA, IV pyelogramic kidney biopsy."
So now you suddenly beliEve in tests?,"The symptoms ""ï¿½"
Enjoying the salad?,There's no lettuce.
I'm aware that there's no lettuce. Do you know when I obtained this knowledge?,"Actually, I'm in the middle of ""ï¿½"
When I made it. For myself.,"Well, how was I supposed to know?"
"Well, I was hoping this might tip you off.","That's kind of selfish, don't you think?"
"I offered to make you some, you said no!","Ah, that was before I tasted the pancakes. It's a compliment, you should be flattered."
Here. It's Mrs. LAmbert's herpes test results.,Mrs. who?
"You've told more than one Patient his wife is sleeping with his daughter's karate teacher? You want to stir the pot, you have to clean up the mess.",What would you do if you got herpes?
"She's coming in at 5:00, don't make me come looking for you.","Actually, I'd know what you'd do. But, I mean, a normal guy."
And don't be calling in sick or saying that your team needs you for some kind of emergency consult.,"He suspected that his wife had also been playing the pickle games, he'd just keep it on the down-low. Just wait 'till she got infected."
He'd give his own mother herpes if it got him out of clinic duty.,"Of course, maybe it was the wife. Maybe she was the one who ""ï¿½"
"Of course, maybe it was the wife. Maybe she was the one who ""ï¿½",Where's Mrs. Nympho?
"She's waiting outside, why?",Go search her.
"What, you mean her medical records?","If I'd meant that, good chance I'd've said that."
You think she's poisoning him?,"His symptoms should be getting better the longer he's here, instead they're getting worse."
"So either she's poisoning him, or it's not heavy metals. We've done over ten heavy metal tox screens ""ï¿½","Because there's no reason to test for the other thirty. They don't get into the air or food, they only get in you if someone puts them in you. The only way we're going to find out what she's been sprinkling on his corn flakes is to search her."
I am not going to accuse a Woman of trying to murder her own husband simply based on some paranoid theory.,It's the only explanation. We've eliminated Every other possibility.
We have not eliminated Every other possibility!,Has he responded to the latest lupus treatment?
He's only been on it for a few hours.,"He hasn't responded because it's not lupus! It's not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She's all that's left. Do it!"
"He hasn't responded because it's not lupus! It's not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She's all that's left. Do it!","Hi, I'm Dr. House. Mind if I take a look in your purse?"
Why?,Because I'm going to need to search it and you for whatEver you're using to poison your husband.
Why would I want to hurt my husband?,Then you won't mind if I search your things.
Absolutely not.,"She agreed to let me search Everywhere else, but this she says no to. Doesn't that tell you something?"
"Yes, that she doesn't want some lunatic doctor searParkng her vagina with a flashlight.",Cameron can do that.
"I am not going to ""ï¿½",The Woman hasn't left the hospital since they arrived. WhatEver she's using she's obviously hiding somewhere.
She's not poisoning him!,It's the only explanation!
"No, it's the only explanation your twisted mind can come up with because you're angry that you can't find the answer and you're taking it out on her!",And you are protecting a complete stranger based on some Parkldishly roMantic notion that people are all so happily married they don't want to kill each other!
Are you calling me Parkldish?,Grow up.
"Let's see! I'm thinking Colonel Mustard, in the music room, with the candlestick.","There's no music room, it's the conservatory."
Same thing.,"No, it isn't. If we don't find out what she's using, start treatment immediately, he'll be dead in a week."
"If you're right. If Foreman's right, you'd have basically raped an innocent Woman. My wife fired the maid. Apparently she's getting rid of anything that reminds her of me.",You did your maid?
"I was nice to our maid, which annoyed her, God knows why.",Maybe she was doing her.
"No one was doing her, all right?","But you still feel responsible. Even though nothing or no one was done, it's still your fault."
"I offered to keep paying her salary until she found another job, but she refused to take any money without doing any work, so!. If you want someone to clean your apartment, it's on me.","You're supposed to be moving out, not moving more people in."
"She's not moving in, she's gonna clean!","Maybe I should just move out, and the two of you could ""ï¿½"
"Yes, she is quite the little actress.","So, let's say she's not poisoning him."
"We should start him on cyclophosphamide, see if it makes a difference.","Yeah, and interferon."
"Interferon isn't an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity, either.","True. But it's pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection. We didn't consider it because it doesn't ""ï¿½"
Because it doesn't make sense! There's no fEver!,"Because he's got no immune system, thanks to the immunosuppressant you prescribed him for lupus treatment."
"He didn't present with a fEver, either.","Because at that point he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction, which again, thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dorMant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection. Give him interferon."
"But if it is lupus, interferon could make it worse. Suppress his bone marrow Even further.","Which is more likely, a rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus in a Patient who's already on steroids or a team of doctors missing a post-viral reaction?"
We didn't miss anything.,"Well, then, I'm wrong, and you shouldn't. Give him interferon!"
It's not working. Both his lungs and his kidneys are continuing to deteroriate.,Up the dose.
We already have.,Apparently not enough.
"I don't think it's a virus. We've been running titers for Everything we could think of, they're all negative.",Increase the interferon.
"House ""ï¿½","You got a better idea, other than lupus?"
No.,Then up the dose.
Mr. and Mrs. LAmbert's appointment was over an hour ago.,"Sorry, I was sick. And my team needed an emergency consult. Your wife has herpes."
"What? That's impossible. I don't have any ""ï¿½","You haven't had an outbreak. Yet. Don't worry, you will."
"But you're the one with blisters on his ""ï¿½",Doesn't mean he got it first. You don't need to have an outbreak to spread the virus.
From you! And maybe I'd actually get more if you weren't getting it somewhere else!,"Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk about."
"I'm sorry, there is no test ""ï¿½",Either of you two Ever sit on a public toilet? Well?
Of course.,Herpes can live for short periods of time outside the body.
"Dr. House, you know you can't get herpes from ""ï¿½","Some politically correct doctors will tell you that it's impossible to get infected by a toilet seat, but they'll also tell you not to use the same bath towel to dry your crotch and your face during an outbreak. See the contradiction?"
I always use a paper cover.,Always?
"Yes, of course.",What about you?
"Oh, please, this is ridiculous.","Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi."
What?,"He could beliEve that you could get herpes from a toilet seat, or he could be cheating on you and be happy to have an out."
"The toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?","Sure, but she'd only refuse to beliEve such a well presented lie if she were innocent. And since you both can't be innocent, you ruddy jackass."
Thanks a lot.,My pleasure.
Wow. Not bad.,"She has a family history of arthritis, doesn't she?"
"Yeah, she does. What does ""ï¿½","Stop the interferon. Do another heavy metal screen, only this time test for gold."
"You don't still think that she ""ï¿½",And don't let her go to the bathroom!
"Why would you care if she ""ï¿½ hello?",Oh!
"Hi, I'm Lady.",What did you do to my closet?
"Uh, I cleaned it. Dr. Wilson said that I could go ahead and ""ï¿½",It's not Dr. Wilson's closet! Where's the wood box?
Wood box?,"Yes, the wood box. It's made of wood, and it's box-shaped. It's been in the back of this closet since the day I moved in."
"I didn't see any kind of ""ï¿½","Well, you may not have seen it, but you've obviously moved it. The question is, where?"
"Well, I did not move anything, I just left the ""ï¿½","Look, it was in this closet, then you came, now it's not in this closet!"
What type of box is it?,"Wood! Wood! It's a brown, wood box, it's got a metal handle, it looks like a tackle or a toolbox ""ï¿½"
Do you need to fix something?,"Um, thanks."
I'm going to the bathroom.,Where is she?
She had to go to the bathroom.,I told you not to let her.
What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?,"Why not, she likes that."
"What are you doing? Uh, your hand is wet.","Sorry, must be nervous. I got some bad news."
What?,"The damage to your husband's lungs is perManent. Kidney damage is rEversible and with the right therapy he should regain full neurological function. Other than the fact that he's not going to be running any marathons, he's going to be fine."
"But that's good news, isn't it?","I'm not finished. When I was a kid, my dad was stationed at a marine base in Egypt. We were in the middle of nowhere and there was absolutely nothing for a kid to do except look for a mummy's tomb."
You didn't want me to go to the bathroom because you wanted to tell me my husband is going to be fine and that you used to live in Egypt?,"I didn't have a pRoblem with you going to the bathroom. I just didn't want you to wash your hands. I nEver actually did find a mummy, but I did learn a fair amount about the ancient Egyptians. For example, they discovered that stannous chloride is not only great for toughening ruby glass, but if it's mixed with gold, it turns bright purple. Now, either your fingers are actually worth their weight in gold, or you've been sprinkling your husband's cereal with gold sodium thiomalate. It's an arthritis remedy it's rarely used here in the US, but it's still popular in Mexico. I've gotta give you props. I've nEver heard of anyone using gold before. It's almost! poetic."
"Why would I ""ï¿½","Because you were trying to kill him, I'd love to know the why behind that why. But you're not going to tell me, are you?"
You're wrong. I love Bob.,I nEver said you didn't love him.
Maybe she was having an affair.,Or maybe she just gets her kicks slowly sucking the life out of a guy and watParkng him suffer.
He must have done something to her.,"Yeah, he had it coming."
The only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath.,Or maybe she just got tired of being married. Didn't want to admit to family and friends that the marriage that Everyone thought was perfect wasn't.
"Shouldn't one of us stay with her? If she tries to run ""ï¿½","Yeah, Cameron, go back there. Well, it would be weird if we were all in the ladies' room."
We started chelation therapy with dimercaprol.,Thrilled to hear it.
His kidney function hasn't improved.,It will.
He's gonna need a lung transplant.,"He's becoming more attractive by the minute, isn't he?"
You're pleased. You think you've proved Every marriage is a mistake.,Do I look pleased?
Cuddy called.,I know. Saw the caller ID.
"Young girl, anaphylactic shock.",You answered?
"Turns out, that's what stops the ringing. It's a weird case. I thought you did the dishes last night. It was your day.",I did. Those are new. Midnight snack.
For a midnight snack you made a pot roast. The same pot roast I made last night.,"Yeah. Actually it was after midnight. Today is your day, right?"
"You want me out of here, I get it.",No it's fine if you stay.
"The place I was going to move, the guy nEver called, otherwise I'd already be there.",I said it's fine if you stay.
"Yeah, that's why you're making me miserable.",Maybe I just want to make sure you do your fair share around here.
That...,What's weird about it? The girl with the allergies.
Yeah. She's immuno-compromised.,What are you doing?
What? You asked me--,"You knew that I was interested, that gives you a valuable bargaining Parkp. Could have had me doing dishes for a week."
Why did she have a clean room in her home?,"Heart transplant. The immune system's in the toilet, mommy builds her little angel a John Travolta quality bubble."
"Six months after the transplant, she doesn't need to be confined to a clean room.","Six months without putting out, Dr Cuddy doesn't NEED to wear thong panties, but it's not our call."
"I was wondering when you'd get around to my panties. She's had 4 days of work-ups. They've tested Everyone who came anywhere near that room, Everything in the room.",It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.
Maybe it's not what was there; it's what she was doing.,Exercise allergy. Love it. What sort of exercise could a strapping young Man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly be--
Or the girl snuck out and she's lying about that.,Or the parents are lying about the room being clean.
These are your big ideas? Somebody's lying?,"Hasn't let me down yet. Re-check mom, dad, the girl, the boy, the room and the home."
Test was negative. No semen allergy.,"Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis, I don't buy that it's unrelated."
He loves her. Did Everything he could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.,What's that mean?
"Love is an emotion certain people experience, similar to happiness. No, maybe I should give a more relatable example.","Oh snap! What did he do to protect her, brillo-pad his privates?"
I assume he washed and he...,"Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions."
"Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions.",You the boyfriend? Need to borrow you.
What is going on?,Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.
Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.,Did you take anything to stay healthy? Something stronger than an apple a day?
Is he ok?,"He's just tired. From being in a coma so long. What'd you take? Don't worry, he can keep a secret. Antibiotics? Penicillin? Any of those names ring a bell?"
"Yeah, uh... my friend Elliot, his dad had like a whole bottle that he hadn't finished so I swiped it and took a bunch for like a week. There's no way I was going to risk breathing germs on Melinda.",This is the one downside of teenage sex. You're idiots. You almost killed your girlfriend. She's allergic to penicillin.
What do you think there was still some on my lips? I brushed my teeth!,"Think lower, and more fun."
I mean... it can... it can go through your stuff?,"Totally, dude! There's this administrator here, whenEver she gets sick she just gives me the prescription."
"But you know they tested Melinda, they said she wasn't allergic to my stuff.","Yeah, 4 days later. By that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock in the bottom of your hamper."
Do you have to tell her it was my fault?,"No. Great part of being a grown-up, you nEver have to do anything."
"It's not an allergy, it's her heart.","What's the good news, what's the bad news?"
Congestive heart failure.,Is which?
Good news.,Why?
"I don't know, it just sounded like you.","New puzzle piece, always good news. What's the bad news?"
We've got 2 puzzle pieces from 2 different puzzles.,Seems that way.
What if her anaphylaxis wasn't anaphylaxis. Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure.,And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?
We explained the anaphylaxis.,"What do you mean 'we'? I did! Guess I thought I did, maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me."
And heart pRoblems aren't so rare for someone who's had a heart transplant. I say we assume House was right about the anaphylaxis--,It is tempting!
"Heart failure could be either infection, coronary disease, or rejection.","Sorry, there's a reason they call it the WHITEboard. It's not my rule. What ties both of these conditions together?"
"Where is... the hooker, I assume?","Right up here, buddy."
You said you'd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex.,I didn't say it had to be with another person. Can you think of anything that would tie together anaphylaxis and heart failure?
"No. I was waiting out there, for hours!","Now I need a lot of foreplay, and then there's the cuddling afterwards. Any way that anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis Even if it responds to epi?"
No. Well no wonder you were in the mood. This month's New Jersey journal of Cardiology.,Have you seen the centre fold? There's no WAY those valves are real! Any chance that the heart failure could be unrelated to--
"No. If you need time alone to work, you just have to say so. You don't have to lie about it.",Lying's more fun.
"Being lied to, not as much fun.",Please have an answer to this question: what's for dinner?
You STILL haven't done the dishes?!,"You want one of these? I think I got a couple of blueberries... ohh... nope, sorry just one. Well don't look all weepy. If you've got a pRoblem with me, deal with it! Short my sheets or something."
At this rate it'll be up to her lungs in a matter of days.,"So... anaphylaxis, heart failure and paralysis. We couldn't put the first two together; I'm guessing we can't put all three together."
Particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick. We did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites.,Can we put any two of those together?
"Could be a virus. West Nile, Even Polio with her immune system shot.","Get an LP. And do PCRs for the viruses. And get an EMG to check for Guillain-Barre. Foreman's right, we've got to find out why she's paralysed. But not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds."
"You didn't get any messages for me last week, did you?",Nope.
"That's funny, guy finally called back. Place I lost? Said he left 3 voicemails.",Gotta pee.
Which I nEver got. If that wasn't clear.,He must be lying. You wouldn't want to live with a liar.
You erased my messages?,Yup! Decided I wanted you to stay. Told you that didn't I?
"You're... miserable, and you're lonely, and you're going to trap me here to keep me Every bit as miserable and lonely too","Yeah, and you're happy happy happy."
"Ok, hey, I'm obviously going through a rough patch here. Your wife leaves, tends to bum somebody out.",Do you know where my pee went?
You're missing some?,"Nope, came out of me and went right into the toilet. Now why would that be?"
"You're William Tell, you could pick an apple off someone's head?","No, it's because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet. The stuff's in the kitchen, you have plenty of time. All that was missing was the WILL."
This isn't a college dorm!,It could be.
We're not 18!,"So what? What did I do to you? I scammed you into doing the dishes, made you sit on the steps. I didn't kill your puppy. I did not make you miserable."
"Oh, so this is therapy?",No... just makes me smile.
"All right, I'm finding a new place tomorrow.","Right, but not tonight."
Well I figure you wanna shave my eyebrows while I'm asleep I wouldn't want to deprive you of that last smile.,"You're not going anywhere. You're going to sit on my couch, and depress us both because you just can't admit that it's over with your wife."
"That's right, I'm here on vacation.",Have you gotten a Lawyer yet?
That's... that's... not...,"You Even called one? As long as you're here, it's just a fight. As soon as you get a place, then it's a divorce. Everything sucks. Might as well find something to smile about."
Melinda's dying.,We're all dying. How fast?
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI to rule out a spinal lesion.,Cuddy? What's she doing on this?
The family lost confidence in us.,I don't blame them. I'll be right in.
This time of the year they're not spraying.,"This girl's tough. She gets what she wants. She's deprived of huMan contact; she gets herself a back door Man. Or in her case, a side window boy. What else has she been deprived of?"
She's on a special diet because of her allergies.,"The boyfriend brings the hot beef, he also brings a side dish. Botulism."
"This paralysis is ascending, remember?",Not if the heart pRoblem was really a paralytic pRoblem.
She didn't admit anything. He admitted the sex and we didn't ask him about food.,Get me a rat.
You have a rat.,"What? We're not going to kill Steve! Only way to confirm this, we inject a rat with her blood, and wait for it to get all botulistic on your ass. In the meantime I'm going downstairs to browbeat the scared dying teenage girl until she... breaks down like a scared dying teenage girl."
"What? We're not going to kill Steve! Only way to confirm this, we inject a rat with her blood, and wait for it to get all botulistic on your ass. In the meantime I'm going downstairs to browbeat the scared dying teenage girl until she... breaks down like a scared dying teenage girl.",You're up early.
We're checking for spinal lesions from leukaemia.,"Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly. Unless this is the Patient with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure, and the paralysis. In which case you're wasting your time."
We wanted a second opinion.,"Second? We've given you at least 8. Ok, well then here is 9. Botulism. Listen to me, have you eaten anything abnormal? Any canned foods?"
No.,"You sure? Lying to your parents is usually the right thing to do, but there is an impending death exception."
Don't talk to her like that!,"You're right, she nEver lies. I was being rude. When your boyfriend snuck in on Friday night - surprise! - perhaps he got you some sexy little treats, huh? Some Honey or some edible underwears, massage oils, come on, anything."
We didn't--,"Yeah, we know about the sex. Turns out that Danny's little Danny is full of penicillin and that's what caused your anaphylactic shock."
"No! It was clindAmycin, what I use.",He said he was on penicillin.
It's a non-penicillin antibiotic.,If the antibiotics didn't cause the anaphylaxis...
It's still on the table.,Everything's connected.
What did we discuss? What was the differential?,"Cameron said... When Dan came to your House that night, did he go through any tall grass?"
What are you doing?,"Your daughter had 2 visitors on Friday night. One of them is still in the room. She has tick paralysis. Dan tracked a tick on to his jeans, which wouldn't be a pRoblem but being a teenager, Dan couldn't keep his tick in his pants."
We already checked her.,Now I'm checking her.
Tick bites don't ordinarily cause anaphylactic shock.,This girl's allergies are not ordinary.
"House, get out of here, we have to re-intubate her, and get her into the MRI.","Time course is perfect. Bite itself sets off an allergic reaction, venom takes 4 days to kick in, heart's vulnerable, hits that first. Then a day later, sets off the ascending paralysis."
Except that ticks aren't usually invisible.,"They are until you find them! oh no, that's dandruff. Okay well that wasn't nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped. It just means that next time it'll be Even better."
What's happening?,That's the tick venom ascending.
"She's going to need a trans-venous pacing wire. Ok, magical tick hunt is over! Only real doctor stuff now.","She's just going to get worse. Ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed. She's going to be dead in an hour, Even if you pump her heart full of jet fuel. Unless you let me find the tick."
The only thing I know for sure is that your daughter's heart won't last another 20 minutes without treatment.,"Okay, just need one final instruction, when I find the tick on the autopsy, do you want to know? I'm thinking not, pRobably will make coping easier."
Not inamrinone could cause death. Death's worse. We have to get her up to the ICU.,"Sorry, a little crowded in here."
"House, get out of the elevator.",You're welcome to wait for the next one.
Got her.,"Well as long as we're stuck here, this might be a good time to look for that tick."
Turn the elevator back on.,"Just be a minute, Honey."
Atropine's wearing off.,Inject her again.
That's just temporary.,"Temporary's fine, we're not hanging wallpaper."
We've got to get her upstairs and put her on norepiniphrine.,It wasn't penicillin. You still think the symptoms are unconnected?
We've got to take care of her heart--,"You wake up in the morning, your paint's peeling, your curtains are gone, and the water's boiling. Which pRoblem do you deal with first?"
House!,"None of them! The building's on fire! We treat her symptoms, she dies, we find the cause, she lives. That tick is an IV drip of poison, we unhook it, she'll be fine."
This is my last atropine. Buys us about 3 minutes.,Let's get her gown up.
Ear canal's clean.,Left foot's clean.
"If it's not here, we've only got... heart rate's 46.","It's here. Looks like a mole or a freckle, something we missed. Check the armpits."
I'm sure he must be mistaken.,Perinuem.
We checked it. If we get her upstairs--,Maxilla.
"Checked. Down to 38. We don't have a lot of time, we've got to--","Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair."
"Checked, checked, checked. We checked Everywhere. It's not-- 35, we've got to get her to the ICU.",We haven't found the tick yet.
"We already kidnapped her, you want to add murder!? We've looked over Every inch of skin on her body, House. It's over.","Hey, is that the first time you had sex? With all the other stuff going on down there she might not have realised..."
Wait!,See? I told you it'd be Even more dramatic.
See? I told you it'd be Even more dramatic.,"Push norepiniphrine, get her heart back to normal. She'll be completely cured by tomorrow."
"Foreman, let's get her into the ICU.",Inamrinone was a stupid idea. Unless you wanted me to get that girl in the elevator.
"Oh, I wouldn't do that.",Wouldn't respect you if you did.
I called a divorce Lawyer today.,Does that mean you're leaving?
Call.,You'll call anything.
My stack's bigger than your stack. You in or out?,"You know that relative to their size, gorillas have smaller testicles than huMans."
"Well then you'd pRobably have an edge over a gorilla, but not over me.","Reason is, primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females."
Do you think there might be a better time to annoy me about my wife?,I'm talking about poker.
"Women are evil, you're right to drive them away. Call fold or raise, storytime can wait!","We're smaller and better than Parkmps, bigger and worse than gorillas. For all our rationality, our supposed trust and fealty to a higher power, our ability to create a system of rules and laws; our baser drives are more powerful than any of that. We want to control our emotions, but we can't. If we're happy, things don't annoy us. If on the other hand, we're sitting on crappy hold cards, little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more. I raise."
So are you going to tell me an annoying story Everytime I raise?,God that would be annoying.
"That sounds like gastroenteritis and dehydration. Order fluids and I'll take it on my service. Bet's to you, House.",They scan his head?
Don't play games. You gonna call?,How's the heart rate?
"I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis. I'm not going anywhere. Put the order in, and have someone tell Alan and Sarah that I'll be up when I'm done. You in or out?",I'm out.
"Oh! Stone cold bluff! You might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards, and a little less time staring at my breasts.",They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.
They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.,Follow my finger with your eyes.
How much longer will doctor Cuddy be?,"Given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party, I'd say it's going to be at least 3 hours before she's Even conscious."
Weren't you at the same party?,I don't drink. I want you to reach out and grab my cane.
What's wrong?,Your son's brain is losing control of his muscles.
Dr Cuddy's message said it was just dehydration from diarrhea.,She's wrong.
Is he going to be all right?,I don't know.
You are mean.,"Hey! How's that anal fissure? Did it heal yet or is it still draining? Oh, I'm sorry, didn't realise you'd come back for seconds. I figured that after the girl on the stairwell you'd be done for the night."
He's joking.,"No Adam's apple, small hands. No surprises this time."
I'll er... see you later.,Got a case.
"Well you could have just said that, you didn't have to screw with me.","Yeah if I didn't screw with you, you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid, which means you'd be useless. Better to extinguish all hope. Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me upstairs, stat."
What's so urgent?,"Two cases, same symptoms. What do 6-yr-olds and 70-yr-olds have in common?"
"Their immune systems don't work as well, could be Listeria.",I already checked for that.
So does asthma.,No no no.
Could both be diabetes.,No! The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle. What's weird is the kind of circle of life thing.
This kid doesn't have kidney failure.,He will.
"Based on this file, the kid just ate some bad food. Was the old Man--",They were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.
This case is 12 years old.,Yep.
And this case is Cuddy's.,She assigned it to me.
She agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis?,"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?"
"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?",What were we talking about?
Two Patients with two symptoms in common. And 5 symptoms not in common.,"While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old Woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was... In case any of you missed that class in med school, that one's untreatable. Kid's got the first two. Took Esther an hour and 20 mins to go from two to three. And less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit."
"This is all because a Parkld has some blood in his diarrhea. He's got a tummy ache, if there was any reason to think it was anything worse, Cuddy would be all over it.",Great. Do a colonoscopy.
On a 6-yr-old kid who pRobably has nothing worse than some food poisoning?,"If you happen to find any purple papules, do me a favour and grab a slice. I want to check for Erdheim-Chester."
"A disease that there have been what, maybe 200 reported cases of, Ever?","If Esther's family had let me to an autopsy, there'd be 201."
"Forget it Chase, your punParkng the shark story is good but she's not waiting for you.",So?
Blood blisters.,"You mean papules. Come on Cameron, who's right?"
Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.,Let me see. If it's not Erdheim-Chester...
"It's exactly what we said before, garden variety viral gastroenteritis, can we go back to the party?",Do a kidney biopsy. Esther's shut down in exactly--
"This kid is not Esther. You screwed up, she died, I'm sorry but that does not mean this kid is dying as well.",Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.
What's that?,Urine.
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.,Still think it's not the same case?
Still think it's not the same case?,"So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?"
I'll go and do a biopsy.,Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains Everything?
"E. coli H0157 causes bloody diarrhea, and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Toxins from the bacteria causes his kidneys to shut down, we should start him on plasmapheresis.","Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?"
Goodpasture's syndrome. Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.,But not the purple papules.
"His hematocrit would have to be low, it's at 44 and Esther's nEver dropped below...",42
You have the file memorised?,It's my lucky number.
You check Esther for that?,"She nEver showed any signs of... if he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain. Chase, run a blood smear and immuno-chemistries. Foreman get an MRI."
I'll page Cuddy.,No you won't.
She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.,"She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her."
You can't handle people disagreeing with you? She might have a different take on this.,"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy."
"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.",Keep your answers short and discrete. Is Cuddy still playing?
The Parkcken is still in Picadilly Square.,Brilliant. She'll nEver suspect that NorMandy is her target.
Is that House? Tell him that the blinds just went to 20-40 and he's running out of Parkps.,How's she doing?
"Well what's going on? The way you took off, something's obviously--",Love to chat but got a game to play. How's she doing?
Are you talking about me?,And what have you got?
Hmm... does sound like high dose cardio meds.,Two hearts. You got the flush?
Still waiting on the final labs.,She drinking her seltzer?
"No, hydration is not a pRoblem.",Means she's bluffing. Push her all in.
SEven of clubs.,"Oh dear, sounds like I messed up. You're going to be stuck with her for a while. Talk to you soon."
The base of his brain's been infiltrated by a small mass. We think--,Pituitary?
Explains the low blood pressure.,Pretty much confirms the lymphoma. Should have started Esther on prednisone.
House!,It's a train. We don't know what kind of train--
Woah,I'm thirsty.
It's closed!,It's not now. We've got one advantage. We know where the tracks are going.
The fact that the end of the line is death... is an advantage?,The fact that we know is an advantage. Which means we can get ahead of it. Next station is the liver. We've got about 90 minutes before it gets there. Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.
I'll do an ultrasound.,"No, treatment will tell us more faster."
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?,Treat him for Everything! Give him acetylcysteine and interferon and silymarine and whatEver else you can think of to protect the liver.
What's going on?,Oh just catParkng up on some TV. How're you doing?
She says the Patient--,I heard. What've you got?
Well Cuddy just raised and err...,You're paired.
What?,Nines?
How do you know?,"Anything lower, you wouldn't sound so excited. Jacks are higher, your voice sounds like Debbie from accounting is sitting in your lap. Ask Cuddy if she can beat a pair of threes."
"Wait, wha... what's going on? If you're going to mess with me, wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?","Yes, it would."
Erm... can you beat a pair of threes?,What did she do?
"I left orders for PO fluids, doctor.","Enough with the codes, she obviously knows it's me."
She's drinking her seltzer.,Did she stop?
Yes.,Go all in.
Umm... but...,Just do it.
"You couldn't care less about this charity Event, you claim not to be messing with me, obviously you're either trying to keep me--","Shut up! Look, last time I wanted the game to go on. I still do. Means that this time you get to win."
Meds seem to be working. Liver's holding its own.,Good.
But the platelets are dropping.,Even better.
Why? It means he's getting sicker.,It's new. New is good. Because old ended in death.
We had to put him on a ventilator.,"He's back on Esther's path. We Managed to make the train skip a few stations which means that instead of 12 hours, he's pRobably got less than two. Which begs the question why. What did we do?"
Acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs.,"Mess with them, not shut them down in 20 minutes."
Slows down all five hundred of them?,Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?
Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,What effects would interferon have on leukemia?
"Depends on what type. Could make it better, could make it worse.",Four-year fellowship to learn that.
Tell House if he wants to play cards he can get his ass back down here and play.,"You hear that? She wants me off the phone, means she's vulnerable. Go all in."
It's over in less than 2 hours. Which means you either have 3 of a kind or just 3's. I'm guessing 3's. I bet five hundred.,Go all in.
You obviously want to bust me . Why would you--,Either you go all in or I tell Everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.
"Oh, oh, oh no, oh no! Ohhhh that's gotta hurt.",What happened?
I just killed two birds with one straight. Goodbye.,"Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old."
"If you need help, ask. These games are insane.",Games have a higher success rate.
"Well, I don't see anything that looks like leukemia. You do a bone marrow biopsy?",No time.
"Even if there is an occult blood cancer, you wouldn't expect interferon to make it worse. And certainly not this fast.",What would move this fast?
"Who may or may not have had Kawasaki's. This kid on the other hand, he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries, choking off blood to his major organs one by one. First the GI tract, then the kidneys, then the brain, now the lungs.",Can anyone think of a reason why Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly? Other than it doesn't. Nice.
What was the old lady's sed rate?,Elevated. 98.
You can't use another Patient's labs to diagnose Kawasaki's disease!,Is that like a dare or something?
You don't have time to be wrong.,"Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he lives, Ian's coronary arteries."
Have you read Moby Dick?,It was a book?
It was 10 years ago.,12
Obsession is dangerous.,Only if you're on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale. I think I'm in the clear.
You do realise it's a metaphor?,"You do realise that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen? God I wish I had a metaphor to explain that better. Go back to the game. Don't worry, I'm not going to get eaten by witches."
Esther didn't have a mass in her heart.,Ian's younger. He can take more of a pounding. Esther died before the disease reached her heart. The disease made a mass and made it fast.
Connective tissue?,"Kid can't take any more theories. Only thing we know is that whatEver that mass is, that's what he's got. We need a piece of it. I'm doing a biopsy."
I'll shut the blinds.,"No let them watch, I do my best work on the big stage. Passing through the superior vena cava."
You're in the atrium. Pull back. You've hit the wall of the heart.,These procedures would be so much simpler if you could do them on healthy people. And out again. V fib!
Cardiac arrest! Call a code.,"Come on, paddles! Come on."
Charged.,Clear!
"Code blue, Iso room. Code blue, Iso room.",And again.
Nothing.,Again.
Again.,You got a clock on this?
How much longer are you going to keep doing this?,Clear.
Wait! I've got something.,He's back.
What are you doing?,Doing what we came here to do.
It almost killed him.,"I know, I was right here. Give me a vacutainer."
"His brain's been oxygen-deprived for over 8 minutes. There might be nothing left, he might--",Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer?
Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer?,"So, what's he got?"
Brain damage.,Good chance. I was talking about before that.
You're not worried about--,"Things I can't do anything about, I try not to."
Very unlikely in a 73-yr-old.,"WhatEver this is is very unlikely. Come on, more ideas, let's go people."
"If it's genetic he's had it all his life, why now?","I don't know, it sure fits nice enough."
Chondrocytomas.,How's it going? You win?
"I got called away. By the angry parents of a Patient. There are THREE of you here, none of you had the sense to stop him, to pick up a phone and call me.","I told them you'd signed off. The parents are mad because their kid is dying, that's understandable. But if he doesn't die, they won't be mad anymore."
"Well if he's brain-damaged, they might still be a little ticked.",I had to do it to save him.
"You had to do it to diagnose Esther. You may have killed a 6-yr-old because you're obsessed with a Woman who's been dead for 12 years. Sometimes you lose, House. You're not God!",He's not dead yet.
"No, but you're done with him, it's my case now. Go home, go ride your motorcycle, go brood in a dark room, just don't go near Ian again.","So, anything else or is it just these sEven?"
"Drop it House, she's right.",No she's not. You know she's not.
We should have called her.,I'm surprised you didn't.
You're going to have to find a way to let this go. We can't go near Ian.,"We don't need to go near him, we have his tumor. Cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol, she may be right about my screwed up obsession, but I'm right about the medicine. How Many tests can we do with that? Look, we cure the kid we solve Everybody's pRoblems. How Many?"
Maybe two good pieces.,How Many okay pieces?
Three would be pushing it.,"Three tests, sEven choices. Okay, what's first?"
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.,"Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?"
"Or it's his immune system, histiocytosis.","Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that."
Time course fits.,"Mr Foreman, you agree with both of them? Thanks for playing."
"If we have enough tissue for two tests, why not do both?",Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.
Sarcoma is more likely to hit a 6 and 70 yr old.,Tuberous sclerosis it is.
You think sarcoma's less likely?,"It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable."
KR67's negative. And PCH antigen is negative.,Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.
Mighty Casey struck out.,"Thanks a lot, didn't read that this weekend."
I vote for neurofibromatosis.,Why?
Because the other choices suck worse.,Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.,You want me out of here?
You come up with anything?,No.
Hey.,We can talk about it tomorrow.
"I erm... I won the poker tournament. I totally played this guy BurMan from Business Affairs. I got great cards, but I don't bet. Just call, no raises. BurMan pairs his king on the flop, I keep calling, the river turns, I check. He can't stand it. He goes all in, he's sure he's won. I call. I flip 'em. Oh!",Pocket aces.
I nailed his ass!,The aces were hiding all along.
The aces were hiding all along.,Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.
So did Esther.,Disease lied.
"Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.","Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--"
We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.,Run the test.
You sure about this?,"Wait, let me think about that. Don't pressure me. Just run the damn test."
Cells look like macrophages.,That's a good start.
That's a good start.,Take your time and say it loud.
CD 68 positive,Start the treatment.
So Esther can rest peaceful now huh?,Yeah.
Forty. You got lucky. You going to call?,"What I do, is not just based on the flip of a card."
You guessed. You got lucky.,It fit.
It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.,"No, not just as easily."
Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible. Are you going to call?,"You know, relative to it's size, the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal."
You've seen one Patient in the last two hours.,CompliCated case. I'm a night owl - Wilson's an early bird. We're different species.
Move him into his own cage.,Who'll clean the droppings from mine?
Twenty-five year old female with sleep issues.,I'm guessing she's... what's the medical term? Upset. These 25-year-old females are usually completely rational. They're rocks. Really. Eh... my theory seems to be supported by the fact that she swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. Get her a shrink. And I need some shut-eye.
She's a little bit more than upset. She hasn't slept in ten days.,"She's lying. Without REM sleep, your neurons stop regenerating - the brains shut down lobe by lobe. She'd be insane after five days - dead by ten."
"Give me a little credit, I know what gets you off. She took the pills to sleep, not to kill herself.",ClEver alibi.
"You knew I was writing one, you gave me notes!","Got a case. It can wait, you two finish. Five bucks says someone loses an eye."
"The brain is being stressed, we need to reliEve that. You've had my article on your desk for the last four months!","I'm a very slow reader. No fEver, no white count, means no infection."
SParkzophrenia?,No delusions.
You read his!,"I signed it, I didn't read it. Aside from the sleeping pills, tox-screen was clean. No cocaine, meth, amphetamines, or diet pills."
Nothing that would cause sleep disturbances. When did you get his article?,Ahh.. about three weeks ago. Let's go back to the beginning.
How far back?,"Genesis. God said, let there be light."
Optic-nerve disease.,I'm sensing another article.
Negative for optic nerve disease.,But she sleeps.
"For like 10 seconds. Maximum, one minute. We also checked the ocular pressure. It's normal.",And she doesn't know she sleeps.
"The brain is often unaware of stage one sleep. CT showed no tumors, no clots, no seizure disorders.","So.. she sleeps, she just can't stay asleep."
You... going somewhere with this?,You know what keeps me awake at night? Monsters in the closet.
"There's no monster in the closet, we looked.","Well, it's certainly not showing up on the scans. Where's Cameron?"
She felt I could deliver the news on my own.,"Oh, this is going to work out great."
Come on.,"If you two guys can't play nice together, I'm taking away your toys. I don't care whose fault this is."
If YOU hadn't---,"I especially don't care if it's my fault. WhatEver this Woman has, it's not showing up on our tests, which means she's sick... just not sick enough for us to see it."
You want us to make her sicker?,Yes. I want to stress her body. Specifically her brain. Keep her awake.
"But pRobably Even with the few minutes of sleep she does have, its torture.",So is cutting people with knives. But you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.
"House, those few seconds of sleep are maybe the only reason she's still alive.","The more symptoms we can force out of her, the more tests we can do, the more tests we do, the more information we get, the quicker we make a diagnosis. See how much more fun it is when you guys get along? You two, take the first four hours."
We've got rectal bleeding.,"What, all of you? So the monster is peeking out from under the bed. Which either means she has a clotting disorder, or she has a tumor in her colon."
We'll do a colonoscopy.,Who's keeping her awake now?
"Yeah, he's got all the ideas.",Who is with her?
"Her partner is donating blood, so she's with the nurse.",PRobably singing her lullabies. I want her awake.
You have to sedate a Patient to do a colonoscopy.,"Why? Just because of the pain? If you find a tumor in her colon, you can knock her out. If you don't - she stays awake."
That much blood is not a 'just a' anything.,When two people fight this much - you know what it means.
"The question isn't what, it's why.","Oh, get a room."
"Do you have a specific type of neurogenic toxin in mind, or should we just start running a thousand different tox-screens?",Just pretend I'm not here. I'll be reading.
"Or it could be us, do you have any idea what it feels like to have a six-foot long hose shoved into your large intestine?",No. But I now have a much greater respect for whichEver basketball player you dated in college.
Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.,"What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy. She got the rash that was diagnosed as poison ivy around the same time the insomnia started. Rash plus nosebleed, plus sleep disturbance equals Wegener's Granulomatosis. Start corticosteroid treatment."
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.,"Much lower dosage. Get her back on the juice, triple the dose. Get a cianga, and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener's."
"She has a... menstrual pRoblems. They're really bad, the pain keeps her in bed all day, plus, she's super depressed.",She said 'super depressed'?
She heard that birth control pills can make her feel better.,She wants birth control pills for her PMS.
I guess.,"Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her pRoblem is more likely a URI than a PMS."
URI?,Upper respiratory infection. A cold.
I don't think so...,I also think she's got a pRoblem with SAC.
SAC?,"Thanks for playing. Stupid American Parkld. If you want the pill, all you have to do is walk into any health clinic in Jersey alone and ask for it."
That for a cold?,"No. That's for your ovaries. I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you Ever had a blood clot?"
No.,"Super. In three months when you need a refill, take a bus to a free clinic. Don't wait around hoping for mom to get another sniffle. Not the sharpest chopstick in the drawer, is she?"
Is this just one of your experiments? You just wanted to see how I'd react to being screwed over by Foreman?,"Nice idea, but no. This was just good old-fashioned laziness. I gotta hand it to Foreman though, he knew that you were a suck up and I don't give a crap. He successfully exploited us both."
"Right. We're both victims. A simple heads up, that's all I needed. You know, between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts, you could have tipped me off.","Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me. And as annoying as you can be, at least I know you're not going to pop a cap in my ass. Witty, huh?"
Yeah of course.,Was she sitting up or lying down?
Sitting up.,Then it wasn't REM.
But Chase says her eyes are moving the exact way.,Did you start her on the steroids?
"Not yet, we were still doing the---",Then she wasn't sleeping.
How do you know?,"Because we haven't done anything yet. She may be able to sleep with her eyes open, but unless you also discover that she's got two extra teats in the hooves of her feet, there's no way she'd be able to retain enough muscle tensity during REM sleep to sit upright. It's a movement disorder. Which rules out Wegener's. Where's Foreman?"
Keeping her awake.,Good.
She could have been exposed to an open wound.,Did she have a dog?
"Animal allergies seems unlikely, but its possible that---",When?
When?,When did she get rid of the dog?
About a month ago. Her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday.,Well then it's not allergies. She's just leaving her girlfriend.
You... spoke to the dog?,"If her birthday was a month ago, she would still be on steroids for the poison ivy. And those meds would have suppressed any reaction she might have had to the dog, which means she lied about being allergic. The dog's a commitment. You pretend to be allergic, because you don't want to tell your girlfriend that you're not planning on being around that long. So I think we can move onto options other than allergies."
We should still do a scratch test. If she's allergic to one thing--,She is not allergic.
"Okay. Well, we could either base the diagnosis on your admittedly keen understanding of lesbian relationships, or, we could do a scratch test.",Do a scratch test.
Why not? Considering her current mental state.,What about her mental state?
You... were right about her wanting to break up.,"It just means I was right, doesn't mean she's suicidal."
A bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place.,"Sleeping pills. God knows why she'd want them. What else can cause sleep disorder, and internal bleeding?"
"Drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping, and compromise the liver.",What are you doing here? Who's keeping her awake?
"Doesn't matter. Liver function tests are through the sky. The liver's not compromised, it's dead. She doesn't need a diagnosis, she needs a new liver.",She's not getting a new liver unless we can figure out what's wrong with her.
"Test for cirrhosis, twelve hours. Test for hepatitis, eight, she's not going to last another six.",So your advice is we just give up?
"My advice is that we narrow our focus to conditions that we can diagnose, treat and cure in less than six hours. And there's nothing on that list.","The girlfriend donated blood, right?"
Yeah. So?,That means they're the same type.
You can't ask the person she's about to dump to donate half her liver!,"Does seem tacky, doesn't it."
"Does seem tacky, doesn't it.",I'm Doctor House. I'm in charge of your case.
What's going on? How come no one is keeping her awake any more?,You're in acute liver failure. We can continue the transfusions and the lactulose. But it's only a stopgap. There's really nothing we can do to stop the toxins from building up in your bloodstream. Which means that in a few hours you will lapse into a coma. And you won't wake up. I'm sorry.
That's it? You're giving up? You're... not going to try to figure out what's doing this to her?,"Well Even with the right diagnosis, any treatment is going to take longer than the time she has left."
"If it's her liver, can't she get a transplant?",Wouldn't work without a diagnosis. WhatEver killed the first liver will do the same to the second.
"But it... but it would give you more time to make the diagnosis, to get her better.","Well, it may give us an extra day or two, but, no procurement agency is going to let a liver go to a Patient with an undiagnosed pre-existing---"
Hannah and I have the same blood type. Couldn't I be the donor?,It is medically possible for us to take a part of your---
"Please, I don't care about the risks!",You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.
You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.,"I just bought us 36 hours. Differential diagnosis - which monster eats your liver, screws up your sleep, and causes bleeding?"
Does Max know Hannah plans to leave her?,"Didn't come up, so I guess, no."
"If she knew, there's no way she'd go through with this.","And if you didn't have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship with Every dying person you meet, we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas and might actually be able to concentrate on the differential."
We have an ethical dilemma.,No we don't. Continue.
"What about splenic cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma? She's the right age.",It could explain the bleeding. Maybe the liver failure.
We're withholding information relevant to her decision to risk her life. How is that not an ethical dilemma?,It's not medical information.
Who cares?,The AMA.
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.,The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.
This is immoral.,"Look, let's say you're right. We tell, she changes her mind, our Patient dies. How is that moral? What else?"
"She's not shrooming, she's a sports nut.",Right. Skiers nEver party.
"She's doing this out of love, and Max doesn't know---","It's only moral to save a person if they love you? That's kind of a selfish way of looking at life. I like Wilson's disease, like cancer, love mushrooms."
"Yeah, but we don't have the time to test for any of these. Before she can get the transplant, we need to do about 80 procedures.","So do those tests, and my tests at the same time. Use the PET to look for cancer, and Wilson's while you endoscope her bile ducts and scrape her stomach for mushroom spores. One of you CT her liver, While the other two check protein CA125, and CA19.5. Oh yeah, if anyone says anything to Max, they're fired."
We have to.,We have to not. Because she's not our Patient.
"She's getting surgery, she's someone's Patient.",Need a little help.
Inexplicable rash on a Patient's scrotum you need me to look at?,27 year old female wants to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend.
That's very generous. This the sleepless girl? What's she got?,Liver failure.
You don't have a diagnosis.,The transplant buys me time.
Let's just skip the part where I say this is insane.,It was her idea.
"If she wants to be an idiot, it's her call. You don't need me. Have one of your team walk her through the process.","The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests, right? Can't really advise them both."
You're concerned about the ethics of this? What's going on? What do you know?,Nothing medically relevant.
But you know something. And it is relevant.,"If I can't tell her, I can't really tell you, can I? And if you're advising her."
I assume this information is in the medical file.,My Patient's confidential file.
This hospital's file.,"You can either satisfy your curiousity, or remain ignorant, do nothing ethically wrong and my Patient doesn't die in three hours."
I take it you've seen that?,"Seen it, digested it, watched it blow up my entire department."
You read Cameron's version?,I didn't read either.
It was good.,Better than Foreman's?
Maybe. He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures. She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent. How any Patient can really be informed without a medical degree.,The same old party lines.
Foreman should have told her.,"Ah, shoulda, woulda, coulda."
"If you allow this sort of thing in your department, you're basically saying it's OK.","No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one."
"They won't trust each other, and they won't trust you.",They shouldn't.
Deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another. Then what would you do?,"I could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world, and Foreman still would have done what he did because that's who he is. We can only hope that Cameron has learned something."
Right. Because you're all about the teaParkng.,Our Parkldren are the future.
Hey! Cuddy cleared Max for surgery. She's OK to go.,How's our Patient?
She's also cleared.,"I don't care about the prep, what about the diagnostic tests?"
"Blood proteins are normal, it's not---",Where's Cameron?
Taking a sample of the bile duct.,Surgery is supposed to start in about 15 minutes.
She had a chance to get one last---,Hannah and Max will be in the same room.
You wanted us to do as much as we can before---,Both awake. With Cameron.
I don't know how to say this...,Good lord.
You can tell me anything.,She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?
She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?,"Ding ding, let's go."
"Ding ding, let's go.",I told you---
I didn't say a word to Max.,This is exactly why you got screwed with Foreman. You're looking for people to do the right thing.
"She hasn't slept, her judgment's compromised due to inactivity in her pre-frontal cortex.","Oh, she could have the best pre-frontal cortex in the history of Mankind, but given the choice of life versus death, those bad bad people are going to choose life."
"Then why did you sedate her? If she wasn't going to tell, if she was nEver going to do the right thing, why bother knocking her out? This isn't about them, if she talks, if she does the decent thing, then you don't get to solve your puzzle, your game's over, you lose.",Yeah. I want to save her. I'm morally bankrupt.
"Ah, it doesn't have to be a motive. But it sure tastes good.","Oh! I am so reliEved you two are here. Without you looking at me, they're playing foosball down there."
Max's heart stopped.,Your Patient is on the other side. Now get yourself upstairs and figure out what Hannah has or Max has risked her life for nothing.
Max's cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation. They restarted her heart and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into Hannah.,"Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?"
"Gastric content was negative for spores, so no mushroom toxicity.",And the initial tests were negative for cancer.
Which cancer were you looking for?,Any of them.
"Not going to tell you much. Her blood was thick after she was given immuno-suppressants. They fight rejection, they also mess up our ability to get any clear readings.",Great battles kick up a lot of dirt. Obscure the battlefields so the generals can't see what's going on.
"So what are your orders, General House?",Sound the retreat.
"She's been taking the decongestants, but she's not getting better, She.. also says...",What?
Her boobs are bigger.,"Wh... how could you get them mixed up? They come in a little wheel, they don't look anything like decongestants."
You speak Mandarin?,I can count to ten and ask to go to the bathroom and æ­ï¿½ï¹ä½ å¿«ç¶ç¥æ¯äºã
"FEver is 106, she's in full rejection mode.",Is that supposed to surprise me?
Her white count is normal.,"Normal is not normal. She's been on steroids, transplant team gave her a cocktail of immuno-suppressants, she hasn't slept in over a week. Her white count should be in the tank."
We should start broad spectrum antibiotics.,"Yeah, you might want to add some Parkcken soup. It's just as useless, but it's got Parkcken. We need to know exactly what kind of infection we're dealing with, what infection causes sleep disturbance, bleeding, movement disorder, organ failure, and abnormally normal white count."
"There is no ulcerations on the skin. The bleeding, it looks more like leptospirosis.",Without conjunctivitis and elevated creatinine?
Makes sense if we were in the Sudan.,You sure she hasn't been out of the country?
"You don't know? Come on, if you don't stay up to date on my notes, where's your next article going to come from?",You talked to the dog?
We're not as up on foreign languages as you are.,Has the dog been traveling?
It came from a breeder.,Where?
"I don't know. A place called Blue Barrel Kennels. They only had the thing for like, two days.",Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?,"Wanna see a magic trick? Oh no, where'd it go, where'd it go? Is it here? How about here? There it is. Oh, it doesn't look anything like a nose."
That wasn't there this morning.,"Give that to the lab, and call the CDC."
And tell them what?,That we have a Patient with the plague.
The... black plague?,Looks that way.
"The plague is carried by rodents, not dogs.","Where there's dogs, there's fleas. If they hail from the southwest, then those fleas can't tell the difference between prairie dogs and puppy dogs. A small percentage of plague cases present with sleep disturbance. Imagine, an idyllic river of bacteria. Okay, it's not idyllic for her, but it serves my purposes. The steroids and the immuno-suppressants acted like a big hunk of dam across the river. Physics 101, put a dam up in front of a raging river, the river rises. By stopping the immuno-suppressants, we blew up the dam, and a hundred foot wall of bacteria flooded her lymph nodes."
We better find out where that dog is now.,"After you restart the immuno-suppressants, then fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin, sulfate gentAmycin, and tetracycline. Use a garden hose if you've got one. Get yourselves some prophylactic treatments as well."
I've got the plague?,"Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that."
Did you remember my DVD player?,"Well if you wanted it, you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out."
"No I get it, it's a drag watParkng porn on VHS.",I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it. That's if you Ever get a phone installed.
"Ohh forget it, I'll come by and get it myself, err after work, Thursday?",Won't be home Thursday.
"No pRoblem, still have a key; I can let myself in and out.","I guess maybe I could bring in it tomorrow. After all, how Many times can you hit pause at the part where Lindsay Lohan wins the spelling bee? What is it about girls who can spell?"
It's a math contest.,What is it about girls who can count?
It's poker night isn't it? You said weeks ago that I could play. Stop making excuses.,"Gotta go, building full of sick people. If I hurry maybe I can avoid them."
"Thank you, I appreciate it.",God talks to him?
"It's not psychosis, he's just religious. The only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium.","No, you talk to God you're religious, God talks to you you're psychotic."
A lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic. That doesn't mean--,God Ever talked to you when you were in the seminary?
No.,"God's loss, our gain. He's either psychotic or a scam artist."
He was actually err... really impressive.,"Well yeah, with the burning bush and all, it's quite the show."
"And he told Cameron, God wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.",God knows you stole Cameron's article?
I'm over it.,Yeah. I can tell that from the Berlin wall of body language between you. I'm shocked that he picked up on it. Low sodium - check for Addison's?
No pigmentation and potassium lEvels are normal.,Cirrhosis?
"Liver feels fine, transaminases are normal.",We should monitor his saline intake to correct the low sodium. No more than one mEq per litre per hour. Let's push the Patient history to see if there's any history of drugs or other delusions. I'll take care of it.
You're going to talk to a Patient?,God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.
God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.,"So, you're a faith healer. Or is that a pejorative? Do you prefer something like divine health Management? I thought God might have mentioned that I was coming."
"I'm ok with faith healer, Doctor House.","Oh! That's a nice one, didn't Even go with I see an 'H' and a medical coat."
The nurses talk about you a lot.,"Ah, don't beliEve them. I keep a sock in my pants. Faith - that's another word for ignorance isn't it? NEver understood how people could be so proud of believing in something with no proof at all. Like that's an aParkEvement."
God's asking for our trust. You can't love somebody and not trust them.,Trust has to be earned; can't trust someone hiding in a closet.
You don't trust anyone.,"You seem lucid, there's no confusion, no lethargy. What drugs have you been taking?"
"Nothing. Erm... some aspirin, I get focused on something, I forget to eat and next thing you know I've got a hunger headache.",So aspirin and hospitals are ok. That's an interesting attitude for someone who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.
Just because I beliEve in prayer doesn't mean I don't beliEve in germs and toxins.,That bottle's been opened before. You refilled it at the water cooler.
Yes.,How often do you do that?
"Few times an hour, he likes to stay hydrated. You think germs might have gotten in?",I think water might have gotten in.
Excuse me. I have a friend with boundary issues. Can this wait 5 minutes?,Is she dying?
Yeah.,Before the end of this consult?
They could build monuments to your self-centeredness.,"Patient, 15-yr-old, faith healer, hotline to God."
What are his symptoms?,"He is NOT a saint. He figures out what's going on in people's lives by watParkng, listening, deducing--"
You're worried about trademark infringement?,"Then he passes on advice from God so he can watch them jump, it's a power trip."
Ah! And there the similarities end. Why is he here?,I fear for the huMan race. A teenager claims to be the voice of God and people with advanced degrees are listening.
"Majority of Americans beliEve in a personal God, what are his symptoms?","Massive cramps, low sodium, turns out he's been drinking water non-stop, God told him to purify his body."
Huge water intake would cause low sodium...,"Which would cause the cramping, yeah I get it."
What? That's it? You solved it. You just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you?,"Um hmm... he's all better. You know I get it if people were just looking for a way to fill the holes. But they WANT the holes; they wanna live in the holes. And they go nuts when someone else pours dirt in their holes. CLIMB OUT OF YOUR HOLES, PEOPLE!"
"Are we certain he Even had a seizure? Him singing and healing, he does it all the time, doesn't he?",Isn't it interesting that religious behavior is so close to being crazy we can't tell them apart?
Or tuberous sclerosis.,"Hmm... how to settle this? We could ask our Patient to ask God, or we could MRI his brain. Which way do you want to go? 'cos I'm open to all of them."
House! Why the hell did you let an unstable Patient wander the hallways?,His leash broke.
"The last thing a terminal Patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure. She was... freaked, she was angry...","And now she's not freaked and angry, and you are."
She says she's 'feeling better'. Maybe not singing or dancing but she's feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months.,Sudden drop in pain could create euphoria. You should let her have her vacation.
"Oh, that's great. And when vacation's over, when she crash lands from all this denial, she was dealing with her illness. Now her expectations are rising and you're not the one who has to be there when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her.",Don't you guys have anything to do?
You actually keep score?,Your MRI results aren't done yet; go back to your room. No singing.
"Well you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium, what are my guy's points for?",Your trick about the spat between Doctor Cameron and Doctor Foreman apparently impressed someone.
"And the second point? Do you think it could be because I... healed Grace? She's been back to see me, I like her.","You like messing with people. That's why you're here now. Now maybe you think that your batteries are powered by God, maybe you don't. Either way, you enjoy what you do."
Yes. I like helping people. I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.,Hmm... but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.
That doesn't happen.,"Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?"
God told me.,That's not fair. We were having fun; it's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there.
He spoke with me about you too.,"Forgive my enemies, nEver date a Taurus when Mercury's in retrograde, yeah, I learnt that one myself, the hard way."
God says you look for excuses to be alone.,"See that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep, but you could say it about any person who doesn't pine for the social approval of Everyone he meets, which you were clEverly able to deduce about me by not being a moron. Next time, tell God to be more specific."
God wants you to invite Doctor Wilson to your poker game.,Don't talk to my Patient.
What are you talking about?,You get all huffy when my Patient stumbles into yours in the hallway but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.
"This is fun, it's like password. Keep talking; I'll jump in when I get a clue what the hell you're talking about.",God knows about my poker game.
You think I told him?,Either that or I start going to Church Every Sunday. That would mess with my bowling league.
MRI shows an abnormal area.,Tuberous sclerosis.
It accounts for all the symptoms.,All of them?
Leading cortical tubers identifiable. We can do this surgically.,Tell our Patient congratulations. Soon his chats with God will be a thing of the past. Tie goes to the mortal.
I'm not normal.,I need you to talk to my Patient. I'll get this one.
Why do I have the feeling you're plotting world domination?,"Moses is refusing surgery. You have a gift, people thank you for telling them they're going to die."
"If I can get him to agree to surgery, I want in on the poker game.",You would let this kid die just to get into a stupid game?
I knew they'd send somebody else.,Think God has a big mouth.
God put them there for a reason.,You think God needs a telephone in your head to talk to you? Isn't he Everywhere? It's not a long-distance call.
"This is the way God does things, through natural law. If he went around doing big flashy miracles all the time, nobody would need faith.",How come Everyone else needs faith but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear? Your turn.
This is the way that the Lord often is with his chosen ones. He... he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.,"How sweet. You abdiCate your authority; avoid those tricky parental issues like whether to let him drive at 16, just let him die at 15."
"So you... beliEve your son is... umm... a saint? The way I understand it, one of the hallmarks of a saint is humility. Now someone with true humility would consider the possibility that God hadn't chosen him for that kind of honor. Well, he'd consider the possibility that... he just... had an illness.",You have a gift for Manipulation.
"I listen, I have an actual conversation with people; which shockingly does raise the odds they'll be co-operative.",That's what I'm saying. You read that kid; you Manipulated the hell out of him. Bring pretzels.
That's what I'm saying. You read that kid; you Manipulated the hell out of him. Bring pretzels.,"I know that knock. Use your key, I'm not getting up."
"I know that knock. Use your key, I'm not getting up.",Game's not 'til tomorrow night. Those aren't pretzels.
I took some images of Grace Palmeri's cancer.,Yeah...?
Her tumor's shrunk.,Don't tell my Patient.
Don't tell my Patient.,"I want all the records on miracle Woman. Every test, Every treatment she's Ever had, Every question she's Ever answered in this hospital. Anything sent for previous doctors. Go back to neo-natal if you have to- Which part of keep them away from each other confused you?"
They're friends. She thinks he saved her life.,Now we have obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true.
They've withdrawn permission for the surgery. I put the Lawyers on it. Her tumor shrank?,I'm on it. Tell Jesus that we need another 24 hours to normalize the sodium lEvels.
It's already normalized.,"Actually, tell Joseph. Jesus will know you're lying. And I want you and Foreman and Cameron to go over Every line of Every file on that Woman."
Isn't he the one we're supposed to save?,The only way to save him is to prove that she is still dying.
You think House will just shrug and say that if one of us doesn't check the home?,"Kings on nines. Wilson! This is err... Dry Cleaner, Tax Accountant, Guy from the Bus Stop. This is Wilson."
How come he gets a name?,Seniority.
Hello.,Find anything?
Do you have any idea how Many electrical devices give off radiation?,All of them.
I'm going to be here all night.,"Everybody's a whiner. Be a do-er, not a me-tooer. Raise."
I'll raise your raise.,Keep looking. Fold.
"So did they find anything? Or are you going to have to accept the fact that Every now and then, remissions happen?",This call had better be worth my time.
This is what happens when it's not our Patient. We don't know enough.,That's why you're there.
She's got a boyfriend.,Unless you think he's radioactive...
He could show up any minute! The honor of working for you is not worth a felony charge.,Give me a minute
"I'm screwed, aren't I?",9 bucks for a straight flush. He's not coming home. Relax. There's nothing in this universe that can't be explained... Eventually. Take this game. Only 2 people knew that you wanted in on it. I didn't tell him.
"I told you, I didn't tell him!","Why would you? No, the only person he's been getting all intimate and conversational with is your cancer Parkck. How would she know? The subject of my poker game isn't likely to come up in the course of a Patient interview. No, that's the kind of thing you mention to someone you're used to sharing the details of your day with."
Don't.,"Your rabbi, guidance counselor, parent... she's not your mom, is she?"
I'm seriously saying don't. [His voice has a very serious warning tone.,You've been having sex...
So not the place.,... with our miracle Woman.
Tell them my name isn't Wilson.,Most people in your situation just have their careers to worry about. You've got that and divine retribution.
Tell them.,"Tell me how it happened, I'll tell them whatEver you want."
She'd had a bad day - pain-wise. Her ride didn't show up to take her home.,So you offered?
Yeah. She didn't have any groceries. She was too sick to go out I... figured I could afford... take a half hour and... pick her up a few things and...,Stay and make sure she's ok.
Yeah.,"And nEver leave. You told me you got an apartment, but you moved in with her. You lied to me."
Tell them!,"His name is not Wilson, and he's screwed up worse than I am."
"Ok, yes, I lied to you. I'm sorry.","Half the doctors who specialize in oncology turn into burnt-out cases, but you - you eat neediness."
"Lucky for you. Thanks for the game guys, don't think I'll be coming back.","You're a functional vampire. Sure, you're heroic, useful to society, but only because it feeds you."
"You're a functional vampire. Sure, you're heroic, useful to society, but only because it feeds you.",There's nothing worth stealing so don't Even look.
There's nothing worth stealing so don't Even look.,"You don't just have a fetish for needy people, you marry them!"
Here we go.,"You mean it, and then time passes and suddenly they're not so needy anymore. Your fault. You've been there for them too much. They're getting healthy, independent, and that's just ugly. God you must be pissed at God right now for making her all happy."
Why are you doing this?,Because you're being stupid. You know what you're risking by sleeping with a Patient!
"Oh that's crap! You're not mad because I'm risking my job. You're not Even mad because I lied to you, you're mad because I lied to you and you couldn't tell!","Yeah, you got me nailed."
"Yeah, that's why you didn't want me in your poker game. Because when it comes to being in control, Gregory House leaves our faith healer kid in the dust. And that's why religious belief annoys you. Because if the universe operates by abstract rules, you can learn them and you can protect yourself. If a supreme being exists, he can squash you anytime he wants.",He knows where I am.
Think it's yours.,Yeah. I'll be right there. Jesus is spiking a fEver. He's delusional.
Tuberous sclerosis doesn't cause fEver.,I know.
I'll drive.,"Pick any random guy off the street, bring him in here, examine him exhaustively and you'll find at least 3 things wrong with him. This kid has tuberous sclerosis - a mild case."
But his tumors are growing.,"We assumed that the tumors were growing 'cos he's getting sicker, but he could have grown old and died and nEver known about them if he hadn't come here. We were looking for something; it's more or less in the right part of the brain. It's like we found someone standing over a dead body holding a gun. We arrested them, didn't look any further. Well sometimes, people really do just stumble into a murder scene."
"His fEver's 103 and rising. If we don't do anything, he's going to be chatting with God face-to-face real soon.",FEvers don't come from a long-term underlying condition. He's a garden variety religious nut who happens to have an infection. It's lumbar puncture time.
I'm sorry; you don't Even know what's wrong with him. God knows the answer and I would rather leave it in his hands than yours.,"Wilson, need you to do your thing."
You do know that I don't actually have magical powers.,I have faith.
Better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal...,Which antibiotics? We don't know what infection he's got.
Go as broad as you can.,Forget it; our best hope is your silver tongue.
What if it's not an infection?,Were you not paying attention when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?
"What if the tuberous sclerosis IS guilty? It had the guns in its hands, it was standing over the--",It doesn't cause fEver.
It causes Everything else. What if the fEver's the innocent bystander? FEver could have been set off by something he picked up anywhere. Could have been a bug he got here.,Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank; the virus went after the cancer first.
Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank; the virus went after the cancer first.,"For 200 years, there've been reports of wild viruses that target tumors. Early 1900's, an Italian medical journal wrote up a Woman with cervical cancer who was injected with a weak strain of rabies, I've no idea why they did that but her tumor shrank."
You think he gave her rabies?,One of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes.
"Herpes encephalitis. It would fit. Seizure, low sodium, Even the blurred vision and it would mean, if you're right, Grace's cancer is coming back. You're not going to be able to convince them. They don't want any more tests. They don't wanna--",They can't argue with the mark of Cain.
I'm not going to change my mind! No more tests! God knows the way.,"Ok, let's start with the shirt."
What are you doing? What are you doing?,"I'm on a mission from God. If you won't let me undress you, then strip."
What's he doing? What's going on?,That Woman you helped? You gave her a virus.
"She's healed, I have a gift!","Gift is jewelry, socks. What you have is herpes encephalitis. The only way you could have transmitted it is by scratParkng one of your own sores and touParkng another person."
"Herpes... that's something you get from sex, right?",Either that or cold sores. Your kid got it from the sex.
"No, no, no sores No, my body's clean, they examined me when I came in! No sores!","Herpes hides. You have an outbreak; it goes away, comes back, goes away. Strip! Maybe you didn't have a sore when you came in but you've got one now."
Dad I've nEver Ever--,Do you Ever wonder why a perfect Parkld of God should feel so desperate to purify his body that he needed to scarf down a dozen gallons of water a day?
"I have faith in the Lord. You, I trust; as much as you can trust a teenage boy. Take off your clothes.","Relax. A few Hail Mary's, a little acyclovir, he'll be picking up angels again in no time."
"Relax. A few Hail Mary's, a little acyclovir, he'll be picking up angels again in no time.",Come in.
My father told me I have to apologize to you.,You still hearing voices?
You're lucky. You go through life with a certainty that what you're doing is right. I know how comforting that is. Good luck.,You're not going to give me my final point?
You knew it was me?,Who else?
Who else?,You don't think God should get a point knocked off?
The tumor shrank.,Because of a virus!
"Do you know what the odds are? She had to have the right type of cancer; he had to have the right type of virus, the exposure had to be--",She won the lottery.
"You say won the lottery, he says... miracle.","Yeah, the hand of God reached into this kid's pants, made him have sex so he could scratch the rash, stick his fingers into some Woman's face, give her a few extra months. Come on, he's just another liar and Manipulator."
Well nobody's as perfect as you are. It is possible to beliEve in something and still fail to live up to it.,So... how's your girlfriend?
She got a little extra time out of this. Not a lot.,She didn't crash.
No. She said she's happier when she beliEves in something bigger than she is.,She still beliEves.
Faith. She's going to Florence.,You're moving out?
Yeah.,You moving back in with me?
I don't think that's a great idea.,But we're ok?
"Yeah, he's not proud of me, he's proud of Jesus. Everything I do right is God's work; Everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.","Cop with a sense of humor. Differential diagnosis. Guy's in the ER, bleeding on Everybody."
Good point. How about! drugs?,Tox screen was clean. He did howEver get hit by a bullet. Just mentioning.
He was shot?,"No, somebody threw it at him."
Reliable witness.,"His name's Baby Shoes, how bad can he be? The fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria. So let's expand the search, factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs."
He got CO poisoning outdoors?,"Yeah, all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify Kyoto. Or he got CO indoors, and then moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead. Test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxyhemoglobin lEvels are higher then 15% stick him in a hyperbaric chAmber. You go check the cop car for gas leaks."
"If it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.","Well maybe she is, but just doesn't have as good a sense of humor. Also check his personal car, his work, home, I'll check the precinct."
"No, you pRobably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place. We have a guy there checking things out.",Sounds ok.
How about the gas intake valve?,Looks great.
It's down in the furnace room.,Your system's fine. If you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick.
Then why are you here?,I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,"Yeah. I've uh, I've got a disability."
These are speeding tickets.,"A lot of emergencies. He's feeling better now, but you nEver know."
I'll see what we can do.,Where does your partner sit?
The place is a cesspool. But I don't think I need to test for anything.,"Nope, waste of time."
You know about the marijuana?,I've heard rumors since junior high.
The cop's acting high because he is high. He's got-,Legionnaires' disease. It's a good thing Joe got shot; the whole precinct would have gotten wiped out. Anarchy on the streets-
It takes 48 hours to test for Legionnaires'.,"And only 2 seconds to recognize that the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit."
"Marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.","Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted. Why don't we agree to disagree. Actually, why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me while treating him for Legionnaires'? It's not as pithy, but!"
He can physically see. His brain just can't process it.,No chance this is a practical joke?
Must be from the trauma.,Bullet fragments just happened to hit the same spot in both lobes? Stroke could cause Anton's blindness and euphoria. Officer Krupke is clotting in his brain. Start heparin to thin the blood. Find the clot and yank it out.
The clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.,"Great! Chase, stick your fingers in there, and grope around until you find it. Oh wait! When you turn him into a vegetable then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits. You know what would be better? Contrast MRI. Do we have one of those?"
"We can't do an MRI. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.","Well, let's flip a coin. Heads MRI, tails he dies."
"Police-issued Kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet. They would just catch it. So the bullet shattered on its own, meaning Baby Shoes was using .38 caliber hollow points, which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.",It's just so cool that you know that!
We could do an angio to find the clotting.,Waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll nEver get a decent view.
Next best thing to an MRI.,And a waste of time.
An angio might show!,"OH GOD!it's a coup! Fine go do your angio. When you're done wasting your time, come meet me down in the morgue."
"You don't have to like someone to be their doctor. Hey how you doing there buddy? Just sit still, and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time. Happy?",What did the angio tell us?
What are you looking for?,I called my mom. She didn't pick up. What did the angio tell us?
That Foreman should be off this case.,He's a neurologist. Unless you think the Patient's optic nerve is in his spleen.
He doesn't like cops.,"Foreman, policemen are our friends. If you and I Ever get separated shopping!"
I was just busting the guy's chops.,"See! He was just busting the guy's chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?"
"There appears to be some clotting, possibly around the Circle of Willis. Based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing. We need to cut into-","Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam up ahead. Is it a ten-car pileup? Or just a really slow bus in the center lane, and if it is a bus is it a thrombotic bus, or an embolic bus? Think I pushed that metaphor too far."
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.,"Oh, so you're saying it was just a waste of time?"
It gave us some information without killing him.,You don't know that an MRI will kill him!
The bullets have a ferrous base!,Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere!
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.,"Surgeons say inoperable, and the Patient's on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan."
You got a better plan?,Much! Bullet's identical to the one Baby Shoes popped Joe with. Let's see how magnetic it is.
Did anyone hear a!,I shot him! He's dead!
"The bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.",Only used a half-load of gunpowder.
It won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an MRI.,How unprofessional was Foreman?
"Worse than usual, better than you. He berated Joe for being a bad cop.",Berated or humiliated?
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.,"One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness."
Whoa! Whoa! You think I'm sick?,I think that an appropriate response to watParkng your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
The fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.,"Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance!"
I can't Even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.,"Well if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork."
Then it won't be a pRoblem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer Patient has a bullet hole in his head.,"The Man donated his body to science! Yes, it's a tragedy! If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first year med students use the carpool lane."
"Do not turn that on, House!","You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out."
"You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.",My bad.
"They have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it. MRI's gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.",Well it doesn't matter; we obviously can't use it on this Patient.
"No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other Patients.",That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I'm sure not pulling my weight.
The blindness hasn't.,Echo his heart.
Looking for what? The pRoblem is obviously neurological.,Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
I'm not sick!,Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled into his skull to reliEve the pressure? Hilarious!
"Someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd!",But not funny.
"If I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source. I'll get sick prove you right.","If you're not sick, it's not contagious and you've got nothing to worry about. If you are sick, the two of you are staying in here until we find out why. So you might want to make friends with the pig. Good news is I can finally get my MRI."
No you can't! You blew up the maParkne!,"Not the portable one, Chuckles. Chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet riddled head."
Wher! where you going?,"To the office, got work to do. Eat your meals, take your temperature Every half hour, and any meds I comMand you to take."
So I'm just a regular Patient now?,No! You get your own thermometer!
No! You get your own thermometer!,"Check your blood, anyone with an elevated SED rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie."
He should be a part of this.,He's a Patient.
He's not irrational!,He's not objective.
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.,"Right. You're not Even friends with him, why would you care? There's an area of increased T-2 attenuation is the cingulate cortex."
Kind of mushy.,"Cingulate cortex control emotions. This mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?"
"Question you might want to ask! a neurologist. Foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.","This is why he shouldn't be here. You wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here. If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself."
No! I-,"Well we'll nEver know; as long as he's not here, he's just like any other Patient. Which means we can dump on him all we want. What's eating the selfish jerk's brain?"
"West Nile, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis!","Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?"
"Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?",Whoa! You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy that doesn't consider you a friend?
He's just a Patient right? It's the job.,Hey! You don't have to go anywhere. Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab. Foreman brought back samples of Everything.
"What was that, 'Who wants to go next'? Some kind of test?","Don't worry. You made the right call. Foreman stumbled into whatEver it is without knowing, and he's way smarter than you are."
"Samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.",What about the blood?
"We have to go back to Joe's apartment, get more samplesï¿½",No one goes back to that place 'til we know what we are looking for. Get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows.
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.,"Yeah, I was nEver that great a math, but next to nothing is! higher than nothing, right?"
It would be his fault if we did.,We should get a sample directly from Joe's brain
We can't do a biopsy. There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.,Well I don't think that this is the time to be pointing fingers. I didn't give Foreman any.
You wanna give Foreman a brain biopsy?,"Come on, really, who doesn't?"
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.,"Without a fEver, not a chance."
Joe had a fEver!,He also had Legionella.
"The mush might be forming an abscess. And since there was inflammation in the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense. The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.",This is a waste of time.
We should put an Ommaya reservoir in Foreman's brain to start administrating antibi-,"If I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly."
"Kernig's sign negative. Brudzinski's sign, single positive. Patient Joe Lureia distal and proximal arm contractures. Duration four seconds.",Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
"Most...commonly? You wanna treat me like any other Patient, do it. But the House I know nEver uses phrases like 'most commonly'",You're not laughing anymore.
No. Think that's a!.good thing?,"Sort of doubt it. Staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver or kidneys before it gets to your brain. Your organs are clear. It's not staph."
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.,Which I would've seen in your MRI Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Let me see the MRI.,There was no abscess on the image.
Let me see it then.,I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago. That soft spot can now be an abscess.,"If it was staph you would have a fEver, which you don't!"
101.6.,What idiot gave you that?
Uh!Square.,Tell me your date of birth.
Square again. Why is he here?,Because my neurologist is having surgery!
I thought I was just another Patient.,You didn't beliEve that crap did you? Date of birth.
"The Ommaya reservoir is inserted into the parietal lobe. My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.","Oops! Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy. Hey, I'm just messing with your head. Mother's maiden name, please."
How is he?,Still dying.
We have Foreman's biopsy results. Non-specific signs of inflammation,That's it?
His result for staph: Negative. He's not Even a carrier.,"Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too."
Can I go to Joe's apartment now?,No. Go back to the lab. Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
For what?,"Everything. Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain."
That's thousands!,"Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman. He's on to hand contractures; he'll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won't be able to tell us. We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we'll see how far behind Joe he is."
"Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman. He's on to hand contractures; he'll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won't be able to tell us. We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we'll see how far behind Joe he is.",Why are you still here?
You're being cautious. You're being!common. When you don't give a crap-,How Many of your guys have caught cancer from their Patients? Let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.
"It's just another case, huh?","I'll bet you can Even have unprotected sex with your cancer Patients without Even catParkng a damn thing. Boy, I wish I had your job."
He's over his limit on morphine.,Where's Cameron?
Foreman!,Imagine being constantly reminded of the pain you're about to be in.
Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!,So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy. Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
You're condoning this?,I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
I'm gonna make you feel better.,Joe has a new symptom: hyperalgesia.
Joe has a new symptom: hyperalgesia.,The infection is spreading into the pain center of the brain.
"His brain is telling him that his whole body is in pain. Because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.",Suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
What if he used cedar wood to hide the pot smell? Aureobasidium fungus can grow there.,Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?
"No. But maybe..,",Maybe what? Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
Maybe what? Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?,Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.,"God, you're weak. Guy steals your article, tells you you're not his friend. You still wanna risk your life for him."
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.,Wow.
Yeah.,"God, you're weak. Guy tried to kill you. First thing on my list of things do would be to stab him back. Shoot him. I've got a gun in my desk. Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and give the bastard Everything he wanted."
I'm not here for Foreman; I'm here to save myself.,"Ehh!. Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That's why you're wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?"
"Ehh!. Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That's why you're wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?",Give me the bag. Mildewed dishtowel.
To retest for staph.,"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara. Explain the blindness.,Now that I recognize as oven crud.
Could be meat with TriParknella. Would explain the high fEver.,What's with rye bread?
Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning which would explain the contractures.,Three loaves.
So?,You're going back in there.
You're going back in there.,Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That's looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That's looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.,You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.",Whistle or something. Do that come hither thing.
Whoa.,"They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern. Joe's been feeding them. Now look down, you see a river of pigeon turd?"
Uhhh... no. There's barely any.,"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way."
"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way.",PRobably been stealing cable from his neighbors. Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings? You see a shovel or a dustpan?
Found a scraper; it looks used. Sitting on a bucket.,Bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for Cryptococcus neoforMans.
Yup.,"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness and intractable pain. Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson: don't cut corners when you're growing your pot. See you back home."
Foreman.,Foreman. Foreman! Time of death.
No.,Time of death. 12:26 p.m.
"You high, Popo?","Cop with a sense of humor. You check the cop car. Also check his personal car, work, home!."
"You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.","Time of death, 12:26 PM.]"
"Time of death, 12:26 PM.]",I need a bone saw.
I'm sorry.,You said you would --
I wish I could,"I just want a little tiny slice of this guy's brain, that's all I need, just enough to tell me what's killing Foreman."
A thin slice of Joe's brain could also cause a public health crisis.,"It's not a good idea to scream ""fire""ï¿½ Every time someone lights a match."
"Don't downplay this, House. You put both of them in isolation for a reason. Joe's death elevates the situation to a biosafety lEvel 3.",Oooh. LEvel 3. We should call Jack Bauer.
I called the CDC.,"Well, tell them we'll be really, really careful."
"We don't have the proper equipment for you to be really, really careful! You can do whatEver you want to Foreman but the CDC will do this autopsy.","WhatEver. The point is, we'll be lucky to get results in three days."
"I told them how urgent this is ""ï¿½",-- and they told you!
We'll have the results in! three days.,"Ah, that's a shame, because Foreman will nEver get a chance to know what it was, because he'll be dead in 36 hours. Maybe this is a toxin; maybe it's not contagious at all. You're killing Foreman because of a ""maybe.""ï¿½"
"Well, you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.","Foreman, c'mere, fast."
What's going on? When are they doing the autopsy?,You're doing it. Now. Ever study how they used to do ice-pick lobotomies?
"Read about it in med school. Why would I ""ï¿½","Shove an ice-pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct. Bang it a couple of times with the hammer, get a sample."
"Foreman, you can't do it! You'd be in violation of ""ï¿½",Can't do the time if you're not alive.
"You ""ï¿½ I need you to suit up. Get that equipment away from Dr. Foreman.","Take your time, guys! Just tell them to go slow; it won't be your fault."
"Foreman, we don't Even know what kind of contagion we're dealing with.",Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head.
It's dangerous!,"Not to you, Foreman."
There are other ways to diagnose you.,"Yeah? You have the answer? Foreman, do it now!"
"I am warning you, do not ""ï¿½",What are you doing?
He's blind.,"He thinks he can see, same as the cop."
We need something to bag the sample.,Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.
"No, no, I'm fine! House, there's the sample, test it! You've gotta test that sample!","Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours. Intractable, unbearable pain is up next. Sure you don't want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?"
We should retest him for bacterial meningitis.,"If it was meningitis, we'd all be sick."
"His CSF might show signs of ""ï¿½","LP's pointless. We already did a brain biopsy, it was negative."
"If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.",How do we know you're not sick?
Do I seem happy to you?,NEver.
It was funny.,"Well, let's assume it's not blood-borne. If you start cracking jokes we can reassess. In the meantime, stay away from people and animals that you care about."
What about arbovirus?,Start treatment.
"For arbovirus? You think our Jersey-beat cop has spent a lot of time exploring deep, dark Africa?","Treatment for Everything ""ï¿½ likely or unlikely. If you can think of it, treat for it."
"We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys! there's got to be a better way.","Of course there's a better way! It's that body sitting in the room with him that Cuddy won't let us touch! Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals, parasites ""ï¿½ it's got to be one of them."
Where are you going?,To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.
Hello?,I'm at the cop's place. You have to retrace your steps.
"You don't think the ""treat him for Everything""ï¿½ approach is enough?",Where did you start your search?
The kitchen.,"You're going to tell me Everything you did, Everything you touched. If you went to the john I want to know when and why."
I started with samples from the mold in his sink.,What next?
That's it. Then I left. What do we do now?,Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.
How's Foreman? You're accessing a webcam?,"Cuddy's shower. Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I, hmm!"
Is that your kitchen?,"Well, obviously I couldn't bring him here. He's been exposed to whatEver Foreman's got."
You infected Steve?! Why didn't you just get a rat from the pet store?,Because I needed one with a clean medical history. Who knows what kind of antibiotics they gave those rats.
"So this is your plan, just sit here and watch your rat all day?","Eh, it shouldn't take long. Got the AC blasting, I soaked the floor of his cage!. As soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy."
As soon as he's dead.,"Right after he gets sick, there's a good chance he'll get hit in the head with a cane-shaped object."
Normally you just use your Patients as lab rats. It's a nice change.,First symptom is euphoria.
How do you know if a rat's euphoric?,"He doesn't usually climb on his water bottle like that, does he?"
The seizures only seem to happen when she's in her car seat. She starts to rock and grunt.,She responsive?
"No, no, it's like she's in a zone. And her abdominal muscles become dystonic.",Big word. Someone's been on the interweb.
"I looked up a few articles on epilepsy. You know, there's actually some really great youth soccer leagues that would Cater specifically to her special needs, and I think it might explain why she's been having a hard time in pre-school.","Well, let's confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back. StRobing lights and high pitched sounds can provoke a seizure. Woooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
You're a goof!,"Takes one to know one, loser! Wait, that means I'm a loser. Scratch that. These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards?"
Soaking wet.,She seem upset by them or just tired?
"No, she kind of thinks it's funny.","You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy. In actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying ""yoo hoo""ï¿½ to the hoo-hoo."
She's what?,MarParkng the penguin. Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood. Finding Nemo.
That was funny.,"It's called gratification disorder. Sort of a misnomer ""ï¿½ if one was unable to gratify oneself!that would be a disorder."
Are you saying she's masturbating?,"I was trying to be discreet ""ï¿½ there's a Parkld in the room!"
This is horrifying.,Epilepsy is horrifying. Teach your girl about privacy and she'll be fine. Here you go.
One afternoon and you're on pace to set the record for most Patients seen in a month.,"You're upset that I'm doing clinic hours? Wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day."
"For the past three hours, I've been on the phone with the CDC while you are wai ""ï¿½","Yeah, how's that going, by the way?"
"They promised to expedite ""ï¿½",Tough to do an autopsy when they haven't Even picked up the body.
"It's tough to treat your Patient when you're not Even on the same floor. Go, clinic is covered.","I go watch the meds drip into his IV, you think that'll make the treatment work faster?"
"Go to your office, play with your ball, write on your whiteboard, insult your team, do whatEver it is you do to figure things out.","Feeling guilty? It's not too late to change your mind. Go call the CDC, tell them you were just joshin'."
Treatment's working.,"The question is, which treatment?"
"We'll start weaning him off, one at a time. Which one do we start with?","I don't care if you do it alphabetically. Just stay on top of his vision ""ï¿½ first sign of regression means we've taken him off the wrong one."
Toxic side effect of his meds.,Philosophical question: how do you want to die?
Old age.,"Your choice is currently between four hours from now and fourteen hours from now, so I'm assuming that means you want the latter."
The cocktail's working. My vision's almost completely restored.,The meds are curing what's in your head but they're trashing your pancreas. That's why you're puking and you can't stand up without screaming.
I don't care! I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.,"Think you can handle a life without a pancreas? We keep you on these meds, you'll spend the last four hours of your life being able to see. Take you off, you'll go blind again, but it'll give us time to figure out what's eating your brain."
Dad?,"Yeah, you two can get caught up later. Sir, I need you to come with me."
"House! Uh, what is this?","He's not a what, he's a who. They Even have the right to vote now. Rodney Foreman, Cuddy. Cuddy, Rodney Foreman."
"Nice to meet you, ma'am.",This is Foreman's dad.
"Yeah, I got that.","Dr. Cuddy here is the Dean of Medicine. Remember that cool autopsy I was telling you about, the one that would save your son's life ""ï¿½ she's the one who can give us the green light to do it."
"Mr. Foreman, I am doing Everything I can to get the CDC ""ï¿½",Won't be soon enough.
"-- and my decision to follow public health safety protocols ""ï¿½","Oh, don't blame the rules. Don't hang this on policy and protocol."
"Steve's still acting normal, no sign of contractures.","They've got the cop's body in a locked, airtight bag."
And a guard on the door. Those feds are seriously paranoid.,"He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours, he's due."
"You haven't sprinkled Senokot granules on his donut, his bowels would open up like the Red Sea.",He wouldn't eat the donut.
Have you seriously been down here for hours?,No. I had to pee a couple times.
You've got to stop blaming Cuddy for this.,"Given that it is her fault, it seems appropriate."
"That part is her fault. The part where somebody wasted his time in a basement plotting the overthrow of a government agency, that one's on you.",The only thing I can do is think. You can pretty much do that anywhere. As long as no one's bugging me.
Only it's moving much faster in Foreman.,"Good! It's an anomaly, anomalies tell us things. Why would this go faster in Foreman, what's different?"
Could be a different strain of the same disease?,"Right! We were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease, we should be looking for a different strain of an unknown disease!"
Foreman's black.,What? How long have you been sitting on this information?
"Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes, stop me any time ""ï¿½ they all affect black people more than whites.","Check Everything. Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites ""ï¿½ look for anything with a documented racial disparity. Wait."
The rat's showing symptoms?,No. He's completely healthy. Maybe that's the difference between Foreman and the cop.
"And the punishment for violating those regulations?! Is it death? Hmm? Because frankly, I'm okay if you get a fine, a suspension, hell, you can spend a couple of years in jail if it saves my life!",You're dying too fast.
Couldn't agree more.,"Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?"
What's that?,"Legion ""ï¿½ Legionella pneumophila."
And why are you carrying a vial of it around with you?,"Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection. Our cop wasn't, he had Legionnaire's Disease. Our cop didn't turn into brain food until we cured the legionella. Legionella slowed down the disease."
Why would that happen?,No idea. Just know that it did.
So you want to infect Foreman?,You gonna tattle to the CDC?
"The meds can't help me but a disease can? Forget it, just take the pain away and put me under!",If I put you under I can't monitor your pain. If I can't monitor your pain I can't tell if the legionella's working.
"I'm not consenting to you giving me ""ï¿½ What was that?","Hmmm, wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something. Would have been much more dramatic. Keep your slippers on, wouldn't want you to cut your foot."
The legionella helping?,Yeah.
Good.,"But not great. It didn't fix anything, it just slowed it down. The whole point was to give Steve a little more time to get sick."
What are you going to do if he nEver gets sick?,Brilliant.
Brilliant.,"Cameron, what kind of illnesses affect huMans but not rats?"
Why are you asking me that?,Because I'm sure you spent the first twelve years of your life dreaming of being a vet. The rat is not getting sick. Cameron is not getting sick.
Sorry.,It's okay. It's not your fault. Presumably you're still healthy because whatEver it is is not blood borne. Steve has no excuse; he did Everything that Foreman did.
Foreman tested negative for Every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.,"And what infections could he be positive for but test negative for? When we test for infections, we look for antibodies. Now, what if the Patient is infected, but has no antibodies ""ï¿½ what if the body is not fighting the infection?"
"Why would ""ï¿½","Neh, eh, I asked first. Let's start with the 'what', we'll deal with the 'why' later."
If the body doesn't recognize the infection our tests come back negative and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.,"Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman. And what if the Patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella? The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire. So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects huMans and not rats, and the huMan body would be unlikely to recognize."
"Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman. And what if the Patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella? The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire. So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects huMans and not rats, and the huMan body would be unlikely to recognize.",The answer is listeria. I'm starting you on amp and gent.
So you're basing this theory on the tests being negative and your rat being healthy?,And the fact that Legionnaire's is helping you.
But the medicine you wanna give me will put an end to that.,Yeah.
And if it's not listeria all the gent will do is cure the Legionnaire's Disease and put whatEver is killing me back into overdrive.,Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I'm wrong. The antibiotics are in the airlock.
I think the first biopsy didn't give us the answer because you didn't go deep enough. I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.,Absolutely. Don't blame you. The world is such a compliCated place if you've got higher reasoning skills. I'm often jealous of smaller animals and retarded Parkldren. Take the antibiotics.
There can be minimal damage if it's done right. If the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.,"One slip, you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth."
I'd rather be disabled than dead.,"Sure, I make it look oh-so-sexy. It's actually not as glamorous as you may think."
The biopsy will tell us for sure what's wrong.,The antibiotics could do the same thing!
Could! Not will.,"We try it, we see!"
The antibiotics will bring back the pain!,"Pain makes us make bad decisions. Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator. Now look, we still have time. I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before."
"Pain makes us make bad decisions. Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator. Now look, we still have time. I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before.",Start Foreman on IV antibiotics. Where's his dad?
Where are you supposed to be when your son is dying?,He's not with him.
He's in the chapel.,"I've started your son on a new course of treatment. If it works, he'll get better. If it doesn't, he won't. While he's not getting better, he's going to experience so much pain that we'll have to put him in a chemically-induced coma while we figure out what to do next."
My son says you're a Manipulative bastard.,It's a pet name. I call him Dr. Bling.
I assume you're here for a reason. What do you want from me?,When your son is in a coma you're the one who's going to have to make the medical decisions for him.
"Oh, whatEver you decide is fine.",You don't care what I do?
"No. I'll be your proxy, but we're not okay. You're scared, you're dying, but that's the only reason you wanna set things right. We're gonna get you better first, and then, if you still want to apologize, I'll be around. I'll call that Lawyer.",Any improvements?
No. As far as we can tell the only improvements the antibiotics are treating is the legionella. I think we need to consider alternate theories.,Like what?
We do the biopsy.,Give the antibiotics more time.
There is no more time; the pain was almost unbearable already!,"So he's almost in unbearable pain, he's not almost dead, which means we have more time."
Why weren't you with Foreman?,"I hang out in the basement, you rag on me. I stay in my office, you rag on me. Honky just can't buy a break."
Do the biopsy.,"Based on the cop's progression I figure he's got another four hours before ""ï¿½"
You figure? You're playing Russian Roulette but the gun's pointed at him.,No. Cutting open his head is what's dangerous.
"Oh, it's dangerous. Well, what would people think? The reason you don't see Patients is because if you know them, you'll give a crap about them.","I know you ""ï¿½"
"He's out. The EEG shows he's still in pain, the antibiotics have had more than enough time, we're doing the brain biopsy.",Not unless you people can't come up with something clEver in the next three hours.
"Now, we're doing it now!","Well, who died and made you boss?"
It's legal.,He's out of his mind! Yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy's head.
I'm sorry.,"You're sorry? You're talking about this Man's son. You're denying him the right to be a part of ""ï¿½"
"Yeah, you're a hero. If it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's. Sorry. Thanks.",That was great!
It was rude and unnecessary.,Yeah.
Go away.,Give me time.
We're out of time.,An hour.
"What does ""out of time""ï¿½ mean?",His O2 stats are at 94 right now. As long as they're above 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.
So what? There's no point in waiting.,You were right. We should be cutting into a corpse's head.
"Yeah! We should be, except the CDC has got the cop's body under ""ï¿½",There's got to be other bodies.
You think this thing has killed other people?,"No, that apartment was a dump. Just because Steve McQueen didn't get sick doesn't mean some other varmint didn't. You give me an hour, I go back there and find a dead animal, we cut its head open instead of Foreman's."
"Foreman's already at 100% oxygen. Once his O2 stats hit 90, I can't wait any longer. Where's your suit?","Either you'll find the answer, or I'll find the answer. Doesn't matter."
92,Found a blind bird.
Great. How fast can you get it in here?,I'll know in about 30 seconds.
"You better have the bird, the surgical team's in place.",I screwed up.
How can you not capture a blind bird?,That's not what I meant. I screwed up the first time through this place.
Foreman told you Everywhere he went.,"It's not where, it's when. He came here in the early afternoon. Me and Steve came two hours too late, you came six hours too early. It's the water, the irrigation system only pumps ""ï¿½"
"House, I tested the water, the water's clean! House.","We tested the wrong water. He stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water. It's riddled with Naegleria."
I know.,You already did the biopsy?
We don't know.,Up and at 'em.
"No, I mean, I don't feel any pain.",Keep your head still and follow my finger.
I'm okay?,"Your breath stinks, you're peeing into a bag. What are our names?"
You did the biopsy? Thank you.,Names.
"Cameron, my dad, and the Manipulative bastard.",You remembered.
"Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba, CDC autopsy Eventually found the amoeba, and House found it in the water in the cop's roof.",Wiggle your left toes.
"Wait, you went back and she did the biopsy?","Your left toes, Foreman."
I just did.,"No, you didn't."
He can't move his toes?,He can move them. Raise your right arm.
"He's right here, Honey, he's ok, he's right here.",Tonight. L Word marathon.
You watch the L Word?,On mute.
I'll pass. Dinner with Cuddy.,Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids? They really ought to save their energy for other things. Like crying.
She's the suck up.,She asked you?
"She's smart. She knows if she buys me enough alcohol, my defences just might be weakened.",Doesn't make sense. Unless she ran out of batteries.
"Hey, I'm recently single, she's single.","You're too nice for her to like you; she's not needy enough for you to like her. She's got an agenda, just not one that includes an appearance by 'little Jimmy'. I'll poll my peeps. How Many of you think that Cuddy asked-- or rather peep."
Chase got a case in the ER; he wants us to take a look.,"Unless Chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony, he had no reason to be in the ER."
Cuddy put him on a 2-week NICU rotation. Patient had an unexplained seizure.,"Seizures are cool to watch, boring to diagnose. What about Foreman? He needs to get his malingering butt back here."
Thanks. I feel great.,"Glad you're back. Cameron makes lousy coffee. Take mine black, the way I take my brain-damaged neurologists."
How are you coming along?,Tell her Everything is great. Neither of us wants to deal with her guilt.
I don't feel guilty.,"Of course not, hell if people felt guilt Every time they accidentally lobotomised a guy..."
I was trying to save his life.,"Yeah, your heart was in the right place. It's just his brain that's not quite where it's supposed to be. Tell her Everything's great."
"It's true. No more left-side right-side rEversals, still some short-term memory loss and spatial processing pRoblems but trying not to be too hard on myself.","Yeah, might pull a muscle."
Seizure that can't be explained by epilepsy. And accompanied by elevated calcium lEvels.,Still bored. Tell her why.
"Because seizure with mildly elevated calcium is diagnostically simple. It's either hyper parathyroid, cancer or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.","Well done. But until you can remember how to make coffee, hands off the Patients."
"Lungs are clear, get an EEG, confirm that brain functions are ok.",Can we focus on the task at hand? Why did mommy twitch so hard she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?
You don't need me for this.,"Of course I need you, we're a team."
"Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries in the brain cause seizures, inflamed arteries in the kidneys cause calcium build-up.",You're a moron; did you Even look at the file? Kidney functions fine.
Whipple's.,What?
Whipple's.,"Test her. Cameron thinks it starts with a ""w""; I'm thinking ""v""."
"Dad vomited this morning, maybe they've both got strep.",Think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guy's poop chute?
V for vasoconstriction.,Gotta be my guess.
"Excess calcium makes blood vessels in the brain clamp down, best case scenario, seizure; worst case, stroke.",Do a digital subtraction angiogram. Foreman can't tell up from down and Cameron's a girl - all that mechanical stuff.
"Sorry, Cuddy says I'm stuck here.",You're late.
And you are in my locked office. Again.,What you got there? Special panties for your date with Wilson?
It's not a date and it's none of your business.,"It's not a date, it is business. And if it was business, you wouldn't say it was none of my business."
What do you want?,I want to talk about your date with Wilson.
It's not a date.,This is fun. Spring Chase from NICU and I'll shut up about your date.
NICU is short-staffed.,"Have you suddenly lost the ability to lie? Nobody's quit NICU in two years. And if you're making up reasons, that means there is no reason. Which means he asked for the assignment, didn't he?"
"If Chase needs a break from you, he should take it.",Absolutely.
I have no idea.,"So what causes seizures, hypercalcemia and the thing where mommy bends like Gumby?"
A little busy here.,"Oh oh, baby's lungs are going to conk out any minute. PRobably want to deal with that."
I'll get right on it as soon as I finish indulging my boss.,Multi-task.
Chemical pneumonitis. Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs when he was underwater. Start him on prednisone; keep him on high FIO2 .,Let the indulging commence.
And tox screen was negative.,"Lithium doesn't show on a basic tox screen, scarecrow."
Myelogenous meningitis could also cover Everything.,"Rare complications of a rare blood cancer. You're not totally hopeless. Get an S-pep and an MRI for the myelogenous meningitis . Search the Patient's place for lithium . Baby's lung pRoblem is bacterial, not chemical, start ECMO . While you're searParkng for the lithium, take a water sample and check the pipes. You want me to write this down for you? I ask you, is almost dying, any excuse for not being fun?"
"I'm not putting that baby on ECMO, the chance of there being bacteria in bathwater--","Why don't you want to work for me? I'm nice, I'm fun at parties."
I'm not working NICU because of you. The baby's x-ray suggests a chemical pneumonitis.,Not to me. X-ray was too consolidated. So why are you down here? Hoping to expand your make out pool to include the preme to nine-year-old demographic?
"I needed a break. From the Patients. They lie to us all the time, Foreman almost died trying to save a drug-dealing cop. I just wanted to get away from that for a while.",What a complete load of crap. What am I a nurse you're trying to prep with this vulnerability thing?
ECMO could kill him.,You don't start him on ECMO and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship. But you do it your way. Nothing more honest than a dead baby
Cuddy's trash?,Not anymore. Paid good money for it. Look at what she bought.
Red clover.,"What is red clover used for, Dr Wilson?"
"Also used to treat asthma, psoriasis, joint pain...","She doesn't wheeze, flake or ache. And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner. She invited an oncologist. It's not a date, it's a consult."
"Mom's MRI was negative for masses, abscesses, there's no sign that she has myelogenous meningitis--","Fascinating, call me when we have--"
She has a subarachnoid bleed.,So why is our Patient bleeding into her brain?
Her blood workup shows her ProTime's elevated.,"She's bleeding because she's not clotting. So why is she not clotting? What'd you bring us, daddy?"
What bleeding?,You don't remember? She bled all over you this morning . Kidding. Idiots are fun; no wonder Every village wants one.
But tox screen was negative for alcohol.,"Hey, it was your idea. Now it's Even better. Mommy quits, she gets the DTs, it Even explains the seizure."
"Also fits conversion disorder. They're deep in Debt, he's working round the clock, they got a new baby - I think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress.",Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.
Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.,Where are you going?
To put her in a phenocoma.,What if I'm wrong? What if daddy's the drunk?
Do you want us to give her the pheno or not?,I want him to argue his point!
I assume you considered the father and ruled him out.,What's that saying where you ASSume you become a pain in the ass to me?
Why should I argue? You'd just overrule me.,Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm!
House!,"I need him to react; I need him to act like a huMan being. I need him to get over this boring, near-death rebirth."
I have changed. It's not something you get over.,"Nearly dying changes Everything forEver. For about 2 months. 2 months is too long, I need the guy I hired back now."
"No matter how much your misery loves company, it's not getting mine. I'll talk to the dad, Cameron can take the mom, we'll figure out if mom was a drinker.",Waste of time; put her in a coma before the DTs kill her.
"Turns out she and her husband met in AA, obviously she slipped. Good call.","It wasn't hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory. Which was not stupid. I'm telling you, I'm going to drop the ""N"" bomb if I have to."
You're addicted to conflict.,Did they change the name?
You could have handled this Patient without dragging Chase in but the fact that he didn't want in killed you. Just like the fact that you can't get a rise out of me.,Where's the baby?
Where's the baby?,"No breath sounds, crash cart and epi, stat! I told you your psych theory wasn't stupid."
She just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her Parkld? Lucky break for the kid.,"Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back."
"Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid, the internal conflict triggers a seizure.","You know what else might be a trigger? A physical illness. It's a wild idea, I know especially since she doesn't have any obviously physical symptoms like internal bleeding or excess calcium."
"I'll draw some blood, test for--","Ahhhh!! Jesus! You've done it again! Will you argue with me?! Drinkers don't eat right, explains the bleeding and the calcium, this might just be some crazy drunk and I'm telling you that she's about to die of myelogenous meningitis."
We already tested for--,Exactly! It's an insane idea!
Ok. What do you want me to do?,"Have an original thought. In the meantime, stress her into having another seizure."
"We can't, she's on Haloperidol.","You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical, therefore, if you get caught, pretend you can't make coffee, mental defectives get tons of slack. Take her off the Haloperidol, hook her up to an EEG, flash some lights, make her pant, shoot her up with a placebo. When she starts twitParkng, if the maParkne twitches along its real. If not, call the cops because she's a psycho killer."
Stop pushing him.,Stop protecting him.
He needs it.,Not if he wants to get better.
He might not be able to get better.,Well then I need a new neurologist.
He got sick doing his job.,"Well if he got killed doing his job I wouldn't keep him on the payroll. I don't care how guilty you feel, or how touched you are by his reborn spirit."
I'm not touched.,Then you're guilt-ridden.
I'm not guilt-ridden!,Then you're pathetic!
"Right now I'm annoyed! Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab is not the way to advance his recovery, it's too much!","You're right, should stick around, make sure he doesn't screw up."
"Oh, give it a rest.",How was dinner?
Cuddy did not mention cancer.,She lost her nerve.
It was a date.,What are you doing?
PCR test.,"You're doing it yourself, in the middle of the night? On a spoon. Cuddy's spoon?"
I'm checking her saliva for cancer markers.,Yeah. I do that after all my dates too. People think you're the nice one.
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?,You go first. You desperately want this to be a date.
Because the alternative is cancer.,"Just admit that you like her. She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod. I think it's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil."
"I stole her spoon, you stole her garbage.","She's my boss. She gets sick, the hospital might replace her, especially if she dies. I'd have to learn how to Manipulate someone new."
Woah. I think I'm going to cry.,Find me when the results come in.
"Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping and sucking motions, she's in an encephalopathic delirium.",Hmm... a genuine physiological illness that rules out a few things. Like what I wonder?
Postpartum psychosis and conversion disorder.,"Thing about being a good loser, you're still a loser."
"The delirium means her brain is shutting down, rEverting to its most instinctual functions.","Since it's progressing, we can assume it's progressive. Which means it won't be long before the brain closes shop altogether. Ideas?"
Another amp of epi!,Chase shouldn't be wasting his time in the NICU.
Could be Wernicke's.,"No, treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine; we gave her that together with the vino."
"Delirium points to lithium, I know we didn't find any but--",She had to be smuggling it in to be getting sicker.
The test could have been wrong.,"Ideas are not soda cans, recycling sucks. Give me something new and shiny. Or go retro, take an old idea, shine it up, add a new symptom... encephalopathic delirium. Pellagra."
She drinks. Alcoholics get pellagra. They eat lousy diets so no niacin.,"He agrees with me, what a shock."
Pellagra doesn't cause bloody vomit. She's still sick and getting worse.,"So... what causes pellagra and crimson spew? Dead baby, while sad, not our pRoblem."
I should have given him more polystyrene.,"You killed him, if you don't get over it, you're going to kill momma too."
"You remove the drinking from the equation, internal bleeding, hypercalcemia, seizure and pellagra are all back in.","Chase, would you get your head out of the dead baby's butt and focus on the barely alive-- How much polystyrene did you give the kid?"
One gram. His potassium just kept rising.,I need your son.
Who are you?,Your wife's doctor. Your son may have had the same condition she does.
"My son didn't have a condition, she killed him.","If I biopsy her intestines, she'll bleed out. He obviously won't."
You're not using my son's body to help her.,"Ok. How about trading him for a beer? Or maybe you're more of a whiskey guy. You didn't have strep or stomach bug the morning you came in, you puked because you were hung over. If she was a recovering drunk and slipping most of the time, you'd be right."
So I drink. You're acting like this is my fault.,People are going to feel sorry for you; they'll tell you that you can't anticipate the unthinkable well the fact is you can. It's just not all that pleasant.
"Look, you don't know anything about how--",I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone without first being crazy enough for someone to notice. How Many times did you go out for a drink because she was crying? How Many times did you stay at work because you couldn't listen to her telling you what a bad mother she is? You were reliEved. When she shut down. She just sat staring for hours at a time. She held the pillow over his head; you slept while she went nuts. Not exactly a draw but--
What is wrong with you? What kind of a person says those things now?,Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.
Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.,Got a dead baby for you to autopsy.
Let Cameron do it.,Love working NICU? I can get you transferred.
"I told you, I just wanted to trust Patients.",You don't give a crap about Patients. Your paycheck. You've been double-dipping. Taking your vacation time here while drawing a salary in NICU. Strange - rich boy doing all that for some extra cash.
I'm not rich.,But your dad was; now he's dead. If you're not rich that means that daddy cut you out.
I'm not rich.,Don't let it change you. And do the test.
How would a baby have flattened villi?,He was being treated with polystyrene.
Polystyrene shouldn't--,It didn't. Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together?
Wheat gluten.,It's great stuff. Unless your body can't tolerate it.
The baby didn't have colic he had celiac disease?,"Just like mom. Celiac can be triggered by all kinds of stress. Bills, Parkldbirth, drunk husband. Every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread a slosh of soya sauce, her small intestine became more damaged, less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals in her bloodstream. Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin, caused the pellagra. Didn't absorb vitamin K, caused the bleeding. And celiac is why the baby's meds didn't work. His body just couldn't absorb them. Switch mom to IV nutrition, its gluten free, that'll spruce her villi right up."
"No, celiac causes nutritional deprivation. Our Patient has excess calcium.",Tell them what causes excess calcium. With a Chaser of bloody vomit.
Celiac Patients are susceptible to cancer of the stomach lining. She has MALT lymphoma.,"Well, she's your Patient now. And it wasn't a date."
"Well, she's your Patient now. And it wasn't a date.",You don't have cancer.
You don't have dwarfism.,"You have no proof of that. I on the other hand, have this."
You ran a PCR on me without my consent?,"Hey, it's good news."
Really? It's just hard to access because of this overwhelming sense of personal violation.,"Deal with it on your own time. Bad news, oestrogen is too high."
"No matter how Many people you tell otherwise, I am and always have been a Woman. Oestrogen is normal.","Not this much, not for at least for another week. That's when you ovulate."
You monitor my periods? Based on when I get bitchy or...?,"Once a month, when you leave the kids cancer ward, your eyes glisten. About three days later, you break your ban on sugar and chow down a bucket of frozen yoghurt in the cafeteria, sprinkles included. Based on the last yoghurt sighting, you've got another week before you ovulate. You're on fertility meds. With red clover as an herbal booster. And the dinner with Wilson was an audition. It's too bad he didn't land the gig. He would have had fun."
"I was considering a donation, not a party.","So... when's our ""dinner""?"
"So... when's our ""dinner""?",Oh he's going to be so disappointed.
I killed my son.,"Is it my turn to say something obvious now? Oh I know, you were insane."
I did it. I chose to do it.,"Yeah, like diabetics choose to not produce insulin. Listen, someone got sick, someone died. Happens Every day. The only difference in this case is it wasn't the same someone."
I could have stopped. I didn't have to listen to those voices.,Spoken like a true sane person. This is not your fault. You're healthy now... except for the cancer.
Those voices felt as real to me as Michael's hand. Right here when he nursed. And... the smell of his hair...,You do not deserve to die.
Maybe. I don't want to live.,She said no.
"So we get her declared unstable, appoint a medical proxy.","She was unstable, now she's sane. She's entitled to refuse treatment."
"We have to change her mind, you can't just walk away.","Fine, go on in there and tell her that Every day is a blessing! So you killed your baby, shake it off, think positive! At least you're alive. Hmm. Kinda hard to sell when you don't beliEve it huh? And you nEver beliEved it. You just wanted all that crap you went through to mean something, well it didn't mean anything, it nEver does. Welcome back."
Why are you doing this to me? I was happy!,You were aspiring to be content.
Don't give me a seMantic argument. I was content with the way things were! That's what happiness is!,"Yeah, if we're all just satisfied with what we have, what a beautiful world it would be. We'd all slowly starve to death in our own filth, but at least we'd be happy. Listen, I need your self-worth to hang on this job. I need you kicking ass here to be all that lets you rise above being miserable, if waking up in the morning is enough, I don't need you."
I can live with that.,No you can't. Not anymore.
If you got treatment then maybe we could... When you see Mikey... tell him his dad says he's sorry.,Hi.
Bye.,Bye.
Did you tell Cuddy that we tested her for cancer?,Yeah.
And?,"It wasn't a date. Turned out she had some skin lesions, guess there was no genetic predisposition."
"Her heart looks fine. ER did a full cardiac workup. Tox screen's clean, blood work shows no infection ""ï¿½",All on the top page. I'm a real good reader. Personal chart handoff means there's something else. I'm hoping it's not personal.
"The guy who brought the girl in says he knows you. I thought I'd met all your *friend*. I was also wondering if you could take a look at these, when you have a chance. No hurry, it's just a couple of medical histories, one with a minor cancer concern ""ï¿½",No pRoblem.
"G-Man! You thought I was going to do it, didn't you?",Do I know you?
"Come on, it's me, Crandall!",Doesn't ring a bell.
"Man, I can't beliEve you didn't ""ï¿½","Unless you mean Dylan Crandall, the Man who'll beliEve anything. See, I just made you beliEve that I!."
You haven't changed. Heard about your leg.,"Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing Twister. Just gonna walk it off. So, who's the girl?"
Jesse Baker's granddaughter. You always said you'd give your right hand to play like him.,"No, I said I'd give my right hand to have his left. Why is she with you?"
"She lost her mom in Katrina, her home, Everything.",Wow.
And I'm her father.,Hmmm! yeah. She looks just like you. Got the same 'fro.
"I wrote a book about Baker, hung out with him ""ï¿½ his daughter.","Yeah, that's how babies are made."
"I nEver knew, she nEver knew. Her mom lied for sixteen years.",That's unbelievable.
Yeah.,"Seriously, I don't beliEve it."
"Her mom was pissed at me about my book; I trashed her and her dad. She wouldn't talk to me; obviously, she's not going to tell Leona that ""ï¿½",You're a sucker. You always were.
Does that mean you're not going to help her?,Why wouldn't I? She's not scamming me.
Acute myocardial infarction?,ER said no. Retest.
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"ER said no. Retest, and read the damn file."
"Delta wave on the EKG looks like ""ï¿½",It's all a 'no.' Everything about her heart is healthy.
She's a Katrina victim!,It's better than Crandall. He's a Katrina victim victim.
"I don't think she was expecting your sympathy. I think her point was New Orleans was a third-world country: toxins, mold, sewage in the streets!","What if her heart is like my bike? Runs like crap when I'm by myself, but take it to the mechanic and it runs great?"
"What are we going to do, keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until she has another arrhythmia? That could be weeks, months!","Relax, I happen to know she's going to have one right after lunch. We are golden."
You can't induce an arrhythmia in someone whose heart gave out nearly 48 hours ago.,"Sure you can, but it's kinda technical ""ï¿½ you stick all these cool little wires inside her somehow, and ""ï¿½"
I mean you shouldn't.,"Oh, right, because it would be much more ethical to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting. There's always a team of cardiologists sitting at the next table, this is Jersey! She's a minor, she's going to need consent."
I'll go talk to him.,"Oh, that's an excellent plan! You'll give him the form and tell him it's wrong and dangerous."
I can handle a simple consent form.,"Okay, I'll be Crandall. Dr. Cameron ""ï¿½"
"House, from what you say, this guy will trust us ""ï¿½",Are you in this scene? Go.
I'd like to talk to you about a procedure we'd like to do on Leona.,Like to do? Is this fun for you?
He's not you! He's not going to mock me.,Stay in character! I'm so scared. Hold me.
"In order to figure out which circuit is misfiring, we need to map all the electrical activity in her heart.",Swear to me on the Bible you'd do this if it was your kid. Good-bye.
Swear to me on the Bible you'd do this if it was your kid. Good-bye.,"It's a map of the electrical pathways of the heart. We send electricity to each, one at a time, until one fails."
It sounds dangerous.,It's a risk I am prepared to take.
"If she's got an electrical pRoblem, couldn't more electricity blow her whole system?","Well, who's been watParkng Bill Nye the Science Guy? The test is perfectly safe. We do it Every day. And you beliEve me."
I shouldn't do the test?,It's crazy dangerous. Just sign the damn form.
"I'm not crying, I can handle this.",Blow your nose. I need DNA from somewhere.
You're not running a paternity test.,"She's going to stay around just long enough to get your bank account, your credit card numbers and then she's going to be off with her next daddy."
"What she's been through! why would you assume ""ï¿½",Because of what she's been through.
"Because that's your default position, always has been!","Because she's still alive! Raised by a junkie, living off the streets, that tends to kick the sweetness out of you."
Figured you'd have mellowed.,That's because you're an idiot.
"If I let you do the test, it means I don't trust her.","No, it means I don't trust her."
Sinoatrial node is normal,Next!
Stop the current.,Is she hallucinating?
She's crashing. BP's plummeting.,"Foreman, is she hallucinating?"
"No, normal waves.",Then the AV node is not the bad pathway. All that was was a heart attack. Reset her so we can find the real pRoblem.

Why are you so bent on her not having a hallucination?,"If she did have a hallucination, then the heart pRoblem that we predicted, found, and fixed was just a gigantic coincidence."
It's getting worse.,"What if the heart isn't a coincidence and isn't what caused the hallucination? An arrhythmia hurts. What if her hallucination was caused by pain? What if she has a disease that translates pain into a bizarre, physiological response, like a hallucination?"

No!,"Give me your hand! Forget it, he's not the perfect mark because he was the perfect mark. Plenty of people got there before you. He's used up, tainted. Pumped dry."
"She's lost Everything, and you're breaking fingers. A new low.","Diagnostically, she needed to be hurt. I wanted to hurt her. Win-win.

Shut up.,"Natural selection sucks. We pick our mates based on breast size, cars they drive!. They did autopsies on married couples and found correlations in pancreas size. We're hardwired to pick for stupid reasons, you have the chance to pick for smart reasons."
I think the GerMans had a similar theory about 60 years ago.,"I'm not advocating wiping out entire races, I'm just saying you don't want to mate with the first plastic cup that buys you a drink."
I'm pretty sure you've got that.,MicRobes can be sneaky.
Ow! Thanks.,Twice a day. This is going to be fun.
I got it. So why were you friends with this guy?,"We were 20 years old, he had a car. If he had been a Woman, I would have married him."
Is he a match?,No. Lying girl lucked out and found one in the registry.
Is he the dad?,I don't think so.
You didn't run the test?,Said I wouldn't.
"Okay, so either you lied or he has pictures of you! being nice?",Stop the radiation.
What the hell is that?,I have no idea.
Lab results from the black ooze. You're not going to beliEve it.,She pooped out of her mouth.
"The sample contained stool and digested blood, how did you guess?","'Cause it oozed; if it was in her stomach it would have sprayed, if it was in her lungs she would have coughed. This oozed, as in squeezed, as in rEverse peristalsis. Who's hungry, Mexican takeout?"
Liver failure. There'd be no proteins to clot the blood so it would clot the blood and mess up her intestines.,"Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours. We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real pRoblem is."
"Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours. We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real pRoblem is.","Hey, need to talk to you. The good news is she doesn't have an autoimmune condition, so she doesn't need a bone marrow transplant and we were able to stop the radiation in time. The bad news: she has potty mouth. Her liver is failing, she's made her digestive system go in rEverse. It's actually much worse than it sounds. We need to do a liver biopsy. I don't know what's going to happen when we stick a needle into her liver, but she could die right then and there."
You need to tell me what to do.,"No inside information on this one. But Crandall, three days ago you didn't Even know this girl. If she'd been hit by a bus you wouldn't lose a moment's sleep. There are people all over this hospital who are in just as much trouble and just as not related to you."
"You telling me I shouldn't care? Prep me to handle it, in case she dies?","It's brown, it's lumpy! I'm going to heave all over my desk."
"Parkcken mole. 21 herbs and spices. I find it very comforting, you defending a Man you haven't seen in years. To know my friend, no matter what, will always be my champion, my protector.","I'm not protecting him, I'm smacking her."
The modesty of a true hero.,"Push me and I'll let her die, just so you'll stop annoying me."
"Here's my theory: you're jealous. He's maturing, he's accepting responsibility, you're emotionally stuck at sEventeen.","He's Manufacturing responsibility, he's not maturing. He hasn't changed at all."
"So then, why do you care?",That black ooze we saw? That was a bowel movement. Out of her mouth.
You're trying to end this conversation by grossing me out? I'm an oncologist. Half of my Patients have their skin sloughing off. Why are you so worried about this guy?,"He was having a rough time with his girlfriend. He was in love, he was always in love. He wanted to marry her, but I thought she was flaky, sending mixed signals."
"So, you gave him advice and she dumped him.","No, I told him that I would talk to her."
And you blew it?,"Technically! I was doing him a favor, she was nuts!"
It's House. He says stop.,Check it out.
Please tell me you didn't have us stop the biopsy to check out some tunes!,"His left hand is very subtle, very deliCate."
This girl is dying.,Be dying a lot faster if I let you do that obviously unnecessary biopsy. Now listen.
"My God! Grandpa was an angry drunk, if only we'd known!","Here's how to become a great artist. First, get miserable. Misery drives you to become a great artist, but the art does nothing for your misery, which drives you to drugs, which makes you a lousy artist, and this is not lousy."
You're saying he didn't do drugs?,Not when he played this. Something was screwing with his personality.
"Yeah, drugs and alcohol don't do that.","And that note that he says is out of tune, it's not, which means that something is screwing with his aural perception, too. Now, what happens when you add all that to the liver disease, which he supposedly died of?"
"Unless you can tell me Miles Davis couldn't play stoned ""ï¿½","Played better when he wasn't. I think, I mean, no one knows for sure."
I'll get Leona a TIBC and serum ferritin.,We can test this in three minutes.
We can test this in three minutes.,"So, what is she, Foreman? Light-skinned black Parkck or dark-skinned white Parkck?"
It's too early to see jaundice from the liver.,True. This is a photograph of Leona when she was 13 years old. She's darker now.
She's been living on the streets for eight months.,"No tan line, so unless those streets she's been living on are indoor streets, I'm thinking she's got iron deposits in her melanin, both byproducts of hemochromatosis, just like Granddad used to make. SQUID exam to calculate the amount of iron in her blood. And treat her with deferoxamine, she'll be fine by lunch. 'Cause, you see, I was wrong before, about the breakfast!."
"I'm not going to get this job, am I?",It's a done deal. I knew it the moment I saw you. Interview's just a formality.
"House, what are you ""ï¿½","Cuddy, this is Patrick Glidahan. Patrick's going to be the new intern rotating in my department."
Sorry. I laugh when I'm nervous.,"Bet you've been doing that your whole life, huh?"
"Cancer, infectious disease, the big devils. I think that medicine has become too institutionalized. We need to send a message to our Patients that we're just like them. I mean, we're all people.","We're all people. I like that. She's all hard science, facts. I like to know a person's hopes and dreams. What kind of music do you like, Patrick?"
I'm late for a meeting.,"You see, this is why the face-to-face interview is so important. You've got to know who you're getting in bed with."
"CT shows her lungs are Swiss cheese. Ventilator's helping, but at this point, her time is basically up.","We dEveloped a theory: hemochromatosis. Like good scientists we tested that theory, we proved that theory. We acted based on that proof and we treated her. As a result of which, she is on the verge of death. Is it just me, or have we discovered a flaw in the scientific method? Walk me through it, step-by-step. What is supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine?"
It's a chelating agent.,What does the chelating do?
Removes excess iron from the liver.,How?
"Iron is heavy, it gets stuck. Deferoxamine is like a lubricant. It makes the iron slick so it can move around again.",Moves around where?
It's supposed to be discharged through waste.,"Her waste system is a little screwy right now, means the waste can't go where it wants to go. What if it went to the lungs?"
"WhatEver's in the lungs likes iron, bound with it, started poking holes.",What likes iron?
Fungus likes iron.,No objections to that one?
"If a fungus is doing all this, she's dead. There are 25 anti-fungals, if we don't know which ""ï¿½","When in doubt, go broad."
Most common is Aspergillus.,"Continue to ventilate her lungs, get her on a voriconazole drip, hope she has Aspergillus."
"The process is confidential. You violated his privacy! How did you Even ""ï¿½","I looked up 'loser' in the cryo bank. You wouldn't look within a hundred miles of that idiot, and yet you're willing to have his baby."
"I'm not looking for a date, I'm tired of looking for a ""ï¿½ ow!","Cotton ball? I don't care if you marry this guy, date this guy, go through his garbage, but you should know. Genes matter. Who you are matters. Find somebody you trust."
Someone like you?,Someone you like.
"Listen, oh, sorry!",It's not what you think.
"Oh, Ingrid! Hi. Okay, you feel guilty about stealing the guy's girl, I get that, and I'm glad. It's a good thing. But you did the paternity test. And either the paternity test comes back negative and you shove it in the guy's face, or it comes back positive and you shut up and your leg starts hurting.",Or I nEver ran the test. Not what you think!
"Leona's lung's collapsed. The treatment's not working, we've got the wrong fungus.",You can stop. She ruined it.
You can stop. She ruined it.,"Three rules for hunting fungus. Location, location, location."
Crandall says she was living in the Parkldren's shelter in Ridgeland.,"Okay, the one thing we know for sure is she was not living in the Parkldren's shelter in Ridgeland."
Why would he lie about that?,"He wouldn't, if he beliEved her story about the sweet little girl trying to do the right thing."
"We can't ask Leona where she was, she's intubated.","Don't try to talk, you've got a big medical thing in your mouth. Just blink if you understand. Fantastic. Blink if you lied to Crandall about Everything. You picked up a fungus somewhere. If you were living in the shelter like you told your new daddy I got nothing to go on, and you will die. So, did you lie to Crandall? You're a lousy con artist. First rule of the game is know your mark. Once you got Crandall to bite on the poppet thing you had him. You could have told him that you were servicing Al Qaeda's suicide bombers for crack, this guy would still let you pick out the colors in your new room. Did you lie to Crandall? Where were you?"

Thank you for the injections.,You're welcome. You came all the way up here just to tell me that?
No.,Pretty much normal. Liver function tests are good.
"Thanks, G-Man.",What makes you think you'd be a good father?
I don't know. Feels right. It feels good.,"Well, at least you've got a good reason."
It feels good is a good enough reason. What's happening?,"She's choking, she can't breathe. Get him out of here, will you? Out! Quick, the curtain! You're breathing on your own, choking's normal. I lied to him, I ran a paternity test. Your lie was a bad one. He is your dad. We're Even."
This episode was not big on giving names of secondary characters. All names used were found on the official Fox.com summary.],He's got a temperature of 103.
And why do we care?,Because we're huMan beings. It's what we do. Said he was at a luncheon meeting.
You took his history?!,Guy looks like Harpo. You should see him.
You asked him what book he's currently reading.,"It's hilarious to watch him try and talk. I asked him anything I could think of. Favorite color? ""Bwuu.""ï¿½"
"It's hilarious to watch him try and talk. I asked him anything I could think of. Favorite color? ""Bwuu.""ï¿½","Favorite dessert topping? Trust me, you'll nEver know what fact may be the key to saving your life"
Whip cweam.,I asked him if he was sure. Where're you going?
You're an ass.,I know. Where're you going?
Which one of you is House?,Skinny brunette.
"No, that's Dr. Cameron.",I'm skinny. How do you know her name?
I was a Patient of yours.,"Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs ""ï¿½"
"Stay! Stay away from him. Shocking, isn't it? Who'd want to hurt you?","You're pathetic. Judging by the growth, I'd say I've been unconscious for two days. You've been sitting there the whole time."
No.,"Judging by the oily buildup in your hair, I'd say you're lying."
I was scared. Pardon me for caring.,Did I lose any organs?
"The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach, nicked the bowel, and lodged in the posterior rib.","Well, I always say, if you're going to get shot, do it in a hospital."
"The one in your neck ""ï¿½",I don't remember that one.
"-- went right through, sEvered your jugular. The shooter turns out to be a guy who ""ï¿½",Don't care.
You don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor? Shot you?,I assume his reasoning was faulty. So what was it? Infection?
"The surgery went fine. You've had no post-op ""ï¿½",Not me. Patient. Harpo.
"You just got shot, House. You should rest.","I got shot. Diagnostically boring. Big fat tongue, on the other hand, endlessly entertaining."
We biopsied his tongue.,And it was negative. And the blood tests were negative.
I didn't say we did blood tests.,You don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue and you don't have to biopsy a tongue unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don't involve torturing the Patient. Any other symptoms beside the increased intracranial pressure? Any guesses on how I figured that one out?
"You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer. Since we don't have a definitive answer, we must not have done an LP, and the most common reason not to do an LP is increased intracranial pressure. He was shot by Security trying to ""ï¿½ House. Will you ""ï¿½ House!",I'm talking to Cuddy.
"Lie down, you've got to be in pain!","Not today, today I'm on morphine."
You're gonna rip your stitches out.,Check Harpo's trash.
Forget about the Patient!,"Come on, you're curious. Trash. You don't know what I'm talking about, but you know it's good."
You can't just be walking around.,"Well, then, stop me."
"You've lost blood ""ï¿½","Physically, stop me."
"You could damage ""ï¿½","You can't, because that would involve touParkng me and then things would get so sexually charged ""ï¿½ I'm twice your size, get your hands off me."
"Everything that lives, eats; Everything that eats, poops: that's why Every organ has a sanitation department, a lymph system. WhatEver's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there. That's what you meant by trash.",Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.
"Sorry, I know it's crazy, but there's no other place. The ICU stands for intensive care, he needs intensive care, so do you.",He needs to be shot again.
"He is handcuffed to his bed, he is sedated, he is not gonna hurt you.",If your security was any good I wouldn't have been shot in the first place.
He is where he's supposed to be. Where you're supposed to be.,Who did my surgery?
"Gillick. Why, you're going to send him a fruit basket?",He screwed up.
It's annoying enough dealing with your Vicodin habit. Quit upping your morphine.,I'm not. I'm reducing it.
And you're not in pain?,I'm feeling better.
"Gillick is very good. Your recovery time ""ï¿½","My stomach kills me, my neck is thRobbing, my leg feels better."
That's amazing.,"It's unbelievable. Since getting shot is not an FDA-approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery."
"Yes. Terribly, tragically wrong. Enjoy the mistake.","He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system. If it's alleviating pain, who knows what else it's doing."
Get back to the ICU before you rip out your stitches and I have to chain you to your bed.,Why did you try to kill me?
I didn't.,Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.
Are you sure you want to be doing this?,"I'm fine, I think. Cameron, you got my records?"
They don't like to release Patients' operative notes.,And yet you're holding them. And whispering.
He's sleeping.,Yeah. Killer needs his rest. Otherwise he's grumpy all day. Hey! Wake up! Watch me save a life!
"Almost for sure it's some sort of infection. We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it's not Even slowing the thing down. Unless we find out what type of infection, we can't treat, and we can't figure out what type because we can't do an LP.",Do an LP. See what I did there? Couldn't have done that if you killed me.
We would have done an LP two days ago if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits. We just cut a hole in his throat. The equation has changed.,Couldn't have put it better myself.
You wanna hear a story?,"I have a rule. People who shoot me forfeit the right to ""ï¿½"
My wife was sick. None of the doctors could figure out why.,"Oh, I know this story. She died, so you selected one of her doctors to kill because that would make Everything right again."
"No, she lived. You cured her.",I'm truly sorry I did that.
"In the course of investigating her illness, you convinced me that Everything was relevant. You needed the truth. I confessed to you that I had had an affair. But it turns out it had nothing to do with why she was sick. Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms. You told her that. You also told her about my affair.",You caught crap. She left you. Now I've gotta pay because you couldn't keep your little Killer in you pants.
She killed herself.,What sort of hospital has glass walls?
It's my husband.,Really?
You thought I just liked watParkng people get needles poked in their back?,"No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife."
Why?,"Don't worry, it's not insulting. At least, not to you. You're satisfied with that answer?"
"You're Dr. House, aren't you?","You're not going to shoot me, are you?"
"You treated a friend of mine. She told me you only talk to people if you have to, and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.","SEvens marry sEvens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours. Maybe there's some wiggle room if there's enough money or if somebody got pregnant. But you've got at least three points on your husband and your frock says he didn't do it for the money and your breasts say you haven't had any kids."
So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error.,Numbers don't lie. We're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has. The most likely culprit is an STD.
You want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer and I have to tell you the truth or my husband will die.,Is your friend single?
What's going on? What are they doing?,I should go. I seem to have torn my stitches.
You collapsed in the hall. Tore your stitches.,I remember. I was there.
How's your gut? It's hurting?,You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?
She locked herself in the garage and she started the car.,You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener? You're an ass.
Now that is a bold position to take given that I shot you.,The shooting just makes you an idiot. You're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in a flag like you did a good thing.
"You're an ass and a hypocrite. You don't beliEve in rules, you do whatEver you think is right! it's all I did. You were my role model.","Watch out, you're getting crumbs on the flag. I didn't commit to honor her, I didn't commit to nEver lie to her."
"Well, if you kept your mouth shut, she'd be alive and you wouldn't be shot.","If you kept your pistols in your pants ""ï¿½"
"It's my fault she's dead! I know it. But why can't you admit it's maybe just a little bit yours, too? That maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up?","Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both."
"Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both.",Infections don't make your eyes pop out.
We should get back. You're supposed to be chained to your bed.,Not done eating. Got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.
This is really stupid.,"Look, my stitches pop out again, I got three doctors to save me. Could be some sort of weakness in the lining of the ocular veins. Okay, I'll be you guys. ""No way, mate! Too much blood to just be a vein! No way hizzy! If it was an artery, he'd still be bleeding!""ï¿½ ""Actually, he'd be dead.""ï¿½"
You think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while sticking the eyeball back in.,"Tongue and eyes are sick. What about the nose? It's right in between, why isn't it sick?"
"So it's not spreading, it's got a common source.",Which can only be what?
"The brain, except the CT was clean.","Check the brain's trash, see what it's hiding."
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.,"I know, all its garbage just gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road."
You're referring to the blood-brain barrier.,What else? Biopsy the barrier.
Wouldn't it be safer to make a few eduCated guesses first? Try some relatively safe treatments?,"Biopsy the barrier, first start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm."
And azithromycin for STDs.,"I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around. If I was married to her I certainly wouldn't ""ï¿½"
"Really, it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.","My body is fine. My mind, on the other hand ""ï¿½"
Maybe she was a girlfriend. Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.,"Spoke to Every nurse on that floor, the Patient only had six visitors. Two females, no babes. His mother and his aunt."
So they missed someone. They're not Security.,My posse nEver saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.
They were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.,"There's only one possible conclusion. It was a hallucination. What does that look like to you, a .6?"
"Anesthesia? No, it's gotta be 6 smudge. Let's say you're right. It wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma, after that much blood loss.",My perceptions are compromised and my judgment is compromised. What if his wife told me that the Patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leopard?
So pull yourself off the case.,And the next case?
You take two weeks. You recover.,And what if I don't? What if it wasn't the shooting?
The guy who sees connections between Everything sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruption?,What if it was the surgery?
What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?,Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?
Working.,We need to talk.
Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?,Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?
Who showed you your surgical file?,How do you know it's mine?
Because your Patient hasn't had surgery and you don't care about anyone else.,"My anesthesia was almost non-existent, and yet I wasn't awake. For some reason, someone decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out."
"There are plenty of reasons to use ""ï¿½","Fine, I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon. Gillick, right?"
"It worked! There's a clinic in GerMany, they've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas and letting the mind basically reboot itself. There's about a fifty percent chance your pain will come back, which, of course, means there's a fifty percent chance that it won't.",You had no right!
To heal you?!,You messed with my brain!
"Why are you so upset? Are you experiencing any neurological symptoms? Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?",No. It's a point of principle.
No trash against the fence. Is your leg really better?,"Don't worry, I'm sure something else is wrong."
We did find blood.,On which side?
The wrong side.,The first thing that makes sense.
"It could mess with his brain, it wouldn't cause fEver. He's been sleeping a lot lately.","You worried? I marked a change of meds on his chart. Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fEver."
"In the brain lining, it is. Blood dyscrasia means cancer.",Find it.
"All the tests ""ï¿½","Have been negative. What do you do if your trash cans are full? You use your neighbor's trash cans. Except it's still light outside, your neighbor will see you. So you go out the back way, into an alley and drop off your trash by their garage."
We'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.,You got that from trash cans in the alley?
The saliva glands in the tongue are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs. It's the next lymphatic system over.,Yeah. Go get lung lymph.
How did he know that?,I wouldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.
"House, we need to talk to you.",How the hell did you know I was awake?
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.,No they do not.
"Fine, I'm lying.",Test was negative.
You knew?,Force of habit.
Surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.,The blood had to come from somewhere. You took a shower in it.
Trauma?,"You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels and poke out his eye and swell up his tongue? Keep riding, I've got a bet with my physio that I can do 100 clicks by Friday. What about blood from the kidneys?"
"Kidneys drain into the bladder which drains into the ureter, there's no way it would mess with the scrotum.","Yeah, basic huMan anatomy. Therefore, I think it's safe to assume that the pRoblem lies elsewhere. But given that this case doesn't make any kind of sense whatsoEver maybe we should Even question the basics."
Maybe he's not huMan.,"An anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let's not rule that one out."
"You may have been lucky. You don't catch testicular cancer early, it kills. PRobably eroded some vessel ""ï¿½","Yeah, yeah, I know. Question is why I didn't think of it."
Eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.,"Sac blowing up, on the other hand!"
If you could think of Everything yourself you wouldn't need a team to annoy.,I screwed up some basic anatomy and I'm misconnecting a testicular explosion with a testicular pRoblem. Think there's any way I would have done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?
She was trying to help you and it worked.,"Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can't think. Seeing as how I'm too old to become a professional athlete, she screwed me over, big time."
You don't want a healthy leg.,"Oh, here we go."
"If you've got a good life, you're healthy, you've got no reason to bitch, no reason to hate life.","Well, here's the flaw in your argument: if I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life, I enjoy it."
"I didn't say it was rational. HIV testing is ninety-nine percent accurate, which means there are some people who test positive, who live with their own impending doom for months or years before finding out Everything's okay. Weirdly, most of them don't react with happiness, or Even anger. They get depressed, not because they wanted to die, but because they've defined themselves by their disease. Suddenly, what made them 'them' isn't real.",I don't define myself by my leg.
"No, you have taken it one step further. The only way you could come to terms with your disability was to some way make it mean nothing. So you had to redefine Everything. You have dismissed anything physical, anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.",Why are you protecting her?
Because she's done nothing wrong?,You're completely comfortable with what she did to me?

You think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?,"Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee, the bathroom was the hallucinatee."
Ah. Bathroom. It figures.,What figures?
You wet your bed.,Damn it.
Test was negative.,No.
Efp and beta HGG say no testicular cancer.,"So, let's recap. We've just ruled out Everything, which doesn't make sense, and the answer has to be something that does make sense. Do a cystoscopy, make sure he's huMan."

The answer to any of these questions, if yes, assume you're right. If the answer's no, assume you're right, but biopsy some prostate lymphs just to make sure."
He doesn't clearly have anything.,How did I get here?
What are you talking about?,"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here."
"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here.",I'm taking myself off my case.
"Your Patient's in critical care, he's had a fEver unabated for two ""ï¿½",I think I'm losing my mind. I'm having blackouts.
"You said you weren't having any ""ï¿½",I lied.
"If you are doing this to scare me, you made your point. Next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.",I'm off the case. Why did you jump up when I came in?
I thought you were going to attack me again.,Again?
"Yeah, you were in my face. You were ""ï¿½","No, I wasn't."
"You came in here with Wilson and ""ï¿½","That was a hallucination ""ï¿½"
"No, you ""ï¿½",-- which means this is a hallucination.
-- which means this is a hallucination.,"How can I tell what's real and what's not? Everything looks the same, sounds the same, tastes the same."
Seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.,"Why not? You're obviously not here. I'm obviously not here, which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I'm really just asking my mind."
"You're talking to yourself, there's a lot of unnecessary explanation.","Hey, I'm trying to work this out. That requires give and take, Even in my own mind."
"All right, what was the question?",How can I tell what's real?
Does it matter?,That doesn't sound like something I'd ask.
"All right, your concern is that if you act in the real world based on information that's not real, the results are impossible to foresee.",With you so far.
"But information is incapable of harm in and of itself. Ideas are neither good nor bad, but merely as useful as what we do with it. Only actions can cause harm.",That sounds like me.
"So you do nothing, you refrain from taking any actions. Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would, but if they're based on faulty assumptions your team will point that out. They won't do anything that could hurt him.",So I trust my team.
No structural abnormalities.,"Something doesn't make sense. What does that mean? It's not rhetorical. I need your input on Everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem."
It means you're wrong.,"It means one of your assumptions is wrong, because if something doesn't make sense it can't be real. So what are our assumptions?"
"We've already redone them, twice.",Let's go more basic.
What's more basic than the test results?,Tests themselves. What does a biopsy consist of?
"You take a sample ""ï¿½",Define sample.
"It's a small, representative piece of whatEver you think is the pRoblem.","You go down the shore, you fill a cup with water. It's got no fish in it. Does that mean no fish in the ocean?"
We can do another biopsy?,"We can fill another cup of water, but we've gotta dive in. We've gotta see what's actually in there."
"Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed, causing parts of his body to blow up! Assuming that crazy assumption is correct, we operate on him, we'll kill him.",What if we could find a way of doing the surgery without giving him more than a papercut?
"A person will be controlling the ""ï¿½","People suck. People have turned you from a guy with a swollen tongue into a guy with one guy, one ball and a stapled-on face.

If all you care about is that something's done right, pick the guy with the metal head."
No way.,"No way no way. You've gotta see this thing in action before you say ""no way.""ï¿½ Come on."
"House, what are you doing?","Nothing. I'm not doing anything. Just throwing out ideas. I think you should put him in a wheelchair and take him down to the OR, but I may be out of my mind."
"Nothing. I'm not doing anything. Just throwing out ideas. I think you should put him in a wheelchair and take him down to the OR, but I may be out of my mind.","Relax, Cameron. I'm not going to cut you. I just want to show what this puppy can do. I can make one millimeter incisions. You know how small that is? Small Even in metric.

And then he cuts off a button on her blouse, peeling part of the shirt away to rEveal her bra."
House.,Does that hurt. Seen enough?
No.,"That wasn't a question. You either do this, or you die."
You've wasted your life.,Yeah. If only I'd dediCated my life to finding someone worthy to shoot.
"If I'd've killed you, would it have mattered?",Not to me.
You don't care whether you live or die?,I care because I live. I can't care if I'm dead.
I don't want to hear seMantics.,You anti-seMantic bastard.
Would anybody care that the world lost that wit?,"Working, here."
"That's all right, you don't have to say anything. Just let me soak into your subconscious. You think that the only truth that matters is the truth that can be measured. Good intentions don't count, what's in your heart doesn't count, caring doesn't count, that a Man's life can't be measured by how Many tears are shed when he dies. It's because you can't measure them. It's because you don't want to measure them. Doesn't mean it's not real.",That does not make sense.
"And Even if I'm wrong, you're still miserable. Did you really think that your life's purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return? No. You beliEve there is no purpose to anything. Even the lives you save you dismiss. You turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it, strip it of all meaning. You're miserable for nothing. I don't know why you'd want to live.",I'm sorry. I know what's wrong.
"House, get out of here! You're not sterile!",He'll be fine.
Great. What's he got?,"How come you guys have nEver tried to yank me off this case? I'm having hallucinations, blackouts."
"But you're always insane, and you're always right.","I'm almost always Eventually right. You have no way of knowing when 'Eventually' is. Every time I've had an epiphany on this one you guys were right on board. No challenges, nothing to explain. No offense, but either you guys are getting smarter or I'm getting dumber."
"We've worked with you long enough to know ""ï¿½",I know the test results Even before you enter the room. We have identical knowledge. How is that possible?
You're wrong.,"Something doesn't make sense. One of your assumptions has to be wrong, because if something doesn't make sense then it can't be real. But what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?"
"House, you're losing it.",I've lost it. Why did you stop me?
Because I think you're going to kill him.,"You don't think that. You know it, because you're in my head. As long as the delusion makes sense my mind lets it go on. To make it not make sense I have to push it past the point where it can trick my mind."
"Hey, hey! This is a nightmare, you're gonna wake up. It's real, you're killing a Man!","It's also possible I may already be dead, but I don't beliEve in the afterlife."
"House, go back to your room. If this is a hallucination, it's a good one: you're pain free, you can walk ""ï¿½","This is not real, therefore it's meaningless. I want meaning. Oh, God. Goodbye."

Wow. And he's black. I thought you'd be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.,Can't keep me.
"Dr. House, you look a lot better.","I am a lot better. No painkillers. No hallucinations. Leg hurts, but it's Manageable. Great job. Gonna miss you. Want to start missing you as soon as possible."
"Well, legally, you're free to go whenEver you want, but I suggest you stay.",I'll take it under advisement.
"If you thought the hallucinations were from your Vicodin pRoblem, why didn't you just check yourself into a rehab facility?",I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.
"But you had been abusing Vicodin for years. NEver had delusions. NEver had trouble sleeping. NEver had any pRoblems other than narcissism and antisocial behavior, until two colleagues died. Your father died. Your issues run deeper than Vicodin.","Well, that's not gonna cheer me up, is it?"
"You need to be transferred to our long-term ward, started on medication, talk therapy ""ï¿½","Yeah, I get it. Uh, just one thing I'm getting hung up on. I can leave whenEver I want. How 'bout I start with that?"
You can't go back to practicing medicine.,I don't want to practice medicine. I've decided I want to be an astronaut.

"Depends on you. Process is pretty basic. If you follow the schedule, agree to take meds, participate in group and individual therapy, we can work on goals ""ï¿½",I set a goal.
Excellent. What is it?,"My goal is to get your boss to write the letter that I want him to write. Now let's talk process. I can smile through gritted teeth and play nice, but there are serious risks of violence involved in that choice so I'm going with turning this ward upside down, making you and your boss' job and life so unManageable that he'll write whatEver he has to write to get rid of me."
"Ow. I've nEver been in the end unit before. Yo, I don't need an escort. Get off me. Who are you? You beliEve these guys? Lecturing me on Manic depression, like I couldn't write a book or two. I stop taking my meds because I want to stop taking my meds, because nothing is wrong with me. No reason to keep dragging me back here. When I'm on them, Everything slows down. That's when the pRoblem is. Hey, nice to see you. My roommate last time couldn't stand me.",Really?
"I'm Juan Alvarez. J.A.'s my stage name, but Alvie's what Everybody around here calls me, like the Woody Allen character in, uh, Annie Hall, but the Puerto Rican version and not as neurotic. So what do I call you?","Oh, you're actually waiting for an answer this time. You can call me House."
"Hey, wait up. I've already got the whole place wired so I'll give you the rundown. Yo, Everybody! This is my new roommate, House, y'all. Main thing you gotta know ""ï¿½",Is this the line?
"Hey, Gabby, meet my new roommate, House. You can call him ""Heezy.""ï¿½","No, you can't."

Ha. Ha. You're funny. You're also gonna come here to get your meds.,I'm not on any meds.

"That's Hal. His real name is Connor, but we call him Hal because he ""ï¿½","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it."
And you should also welcome Greg to the floor.,Don't worry about the name. I'm just passing through. Don't want to break any hearts.
"Not now, Jay.","So he's claustrophobic, right? You're claustrophobic? Can I get a pen to write this stuff down?"
It's okay.,Paranoid. Check.
"I swear I'm eating less and less, and I just keep getting bigger and bigger.",A crayon? Anybody?
Maybe we can hang some of the new pieces on the wall.,"Cut your wrists, huh?"
"Greg, there are certain topics ""ï¿½","Oh, I'm sorry. Is suicide taboo? Gosh, if I've broken a rule on my first day, I will kill myself."
Group's over.,That flew by.
You realize you're not the first uncooperative Patient on this floor?,Really? Is there a club?
That didn't take long.,I'm that good.
"Pass, pass, pass! Good. Come on, guys! Ready to play nice?","Would you beliEve me if I said ""yes""ï¿½?"
No.,"Then, yes."
You do know I'm trying to help you.,"I also know you're trying to be sweet, caring and effective. You're just not."
You want out. Just talk. Be honest. Try to work with people. Try to deal with people.,Okay.
"House, House! He's on my team!",Shut up. Nobody likes you.
Hey.,Am I crowding you?
What?,Can't see the sun?
Huh?,"Oh, no! Everything is closing in."
Okay.,"He's the claustrophobic one, right? 'Cause I'm doing this from memory."
You have to dribble.,"Why? The CIA satellites aren't watParkng me. They're watParkng you, 'cause you're wearing green. That one was just too easy. Seriously, anorexia?

How upset were you when you woke up in the ER and you were still alive and a failure?"
"Whoo-hoo. Two-nothing. Good, guys!",You're right. It is rewarding when you reach out.
You can't go up there. It's yard time now.,Put it on my tab.
Put it on my tab.,I think you'll find music therapy's more effective if the Patients are inside to hear it. Where'd you get the key?
They gave it to me.,"So, if she Ever talks, are we gonna get a GerMan accent?"
"No. She's, um, my husband's sister.",So let him come play the piano.
He doesn't know how to play.,"Nice. You're a little heavy on the right foot, though."
See her head? It bobs to the music. It's the only real reaction I'm getting from her. It feels like! we're talking.,You're not talking. Her head is bobbing to her pulse.
Are you a new doctor on the ward?,"Technically, yes."
"Technically, yes.",Can I lead this time?
Come on.,Leave the lid unlocked when you're done.
Leave the lid unlocked when you're done.,Can you close the door? You're letting all the cool air out.
"Girl! Come on, House. You can serve.","I've had some time to think about the approach I've been taking. I'm new, unhappy here, and I've been taking it out on you guys! unfairly. It was! misdirected anger. 'Cause when you think about it, the real jerks here are the doctors."
House.,"See how they give you a ping pong table, but no paddles. No net. It's like they're mocking you."
Preach!,"The game is called table tennis, not table volleyball."
"Greg, you know where this is gonna end.",Who Ever saw a tennis court without a net?
"Little run-down Park across from my apartment growing up. Three courts, no nets. No one Ever used it.",No one's gonna try to hang themselves with a ping pong net.
"It ain't right, doc. You treat us like little kids.","No, little kids are allowed to play ping pong and they can play the piano."
House is right. I think Everyone here can handle these.,Seriously? Is that your strategy? Give Everybody what they want except me?
"Came to fight the Man and he had the master plan, but it started to unravel, Nolan smashed him with his gavel like BLAH.",Shut up.
So you gonna keep trying to make them miserable?,No
New plan?,Yep.
What is it?,I don't know yet.
"His mind is burning, the wheels are turning, the butter is churning. You think Nolan can keep House from strolling? ""ï¿½","You know, it's easier to come up with a new plan in silence."
"I know you're scheming. Working on your next elaborate plan to get out of here. Why don't you put the plan on hold for a few days? See what happens. Just let me do my job. If you prefer private to group, we can do that, maybe try some SSRIs. If you think nothing's working, you can always go back to your schemes.","God, if only you'd said that two minutes ago, before I came up with my new scheme. Now I'm committed. Ha! Get it!"

Ever since I shared in group about my uncle fondling me.,Is that true?
"Yeah. And now I can use the third-floor vending maParknes. You eat sour cream and onion Parkps? I mean the whole point is the dipping. Sure, we save time by not adding the mix and sour cream, but you're missing out on the ""ï¿½",I need you to break into Nolan's office.
ComMando style.,I want you to focus.
You want me to mess him up?,Go into Nolan's office. Look at his calendar. I need the name of the Woman he met with at 11 today.
"No pRoblem. And I'll get you some old-school Parkps. If they have them, I'll get you some dip. But I've nEver seen dip in the vending maParkne.","Yes, get me Parkps and dip. What else?"
"Let me go! I just wanted a little snack, all right? Yo, I didn't know they maParkne was moved! I want some Ritz Bits. Yo, I might be pregnant! I get these cravings!",You get the name?
"Nolan's schedule book just has a big ""X""ï¿½ marking out the whole middle of the day.","Well, then we can assume the girl he's with is called ""Nooner.""ï¿½"
"Nooner, Nooner, Nolan's gonna spoon her.",He's gonna fork her.
And then he's gonna knife her. I didn't get a chance to check the phone or anything else.,That's okay. I got her license plate. I call my friend. He gets the name. I get the letter that gets me out of here.
You got phone privileges?,I'm on lEvel minus four. I'm still writing with a crayon. You?
You got to be at lEvel five. That's like the top of the Space Needle. Hal's the only one that's up that high.,Hal's at lEvel five?
They give him a point Every time he clears his plate. I've been eating his potatoes.,Will he sell you some minutes?
No. I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes. Phone's worth a lot more.,Can you cheek a pill?
No.,That's too bad for you.
That's too bad for you.,You sure you're good with this?
"Yeah, yeah. Gotta be done.",So how do we start?
"Dude, that was awesome.",Think Hal will mind if they're wet?
House?,No. It's your other friend at the asylum.
How's it going?,"Hallucinations are gone, so is the Vicodin."
How's the leg? How's the pain?,They got me on some non-narcotic. I'm dealing. I need you to run a license plate.
"Was there a hit-and-run on your floor? House, just do what you're supposed to do. Listen to the doctors and I'll be able to visit soon.","Track down the owner of this car, and I'll be able to visit you in your office tomorrow. My doctor is too smart, too old and too well-dressed to only be running one ward. He screwed up something in his life and I think he's doing it again. I need her name so I can blackmail the blackmailer."
House. House. He called me.,What did he want to know?
"He wanted to know about you. He wanted to warn me that you'd be calling for something. And he told me if I wanted to help you get better, I had to let him do his job.","Well, now I'm calling you to tell you that if he calls you ""ï¿½"
"House, I'm so sorry. I wish I could help you.",You can.
You can.,It turns out! you're my only friend.
"House ain't a newbie, now he living on this floor.",And I hate you. I'm gonna cooperate.
That's not much of a plan. That's actually their plan.,"No, I'm pretty sure their plan is for me to actually swallow the pills, to actually cooperate."
I'm so proud of my little roomie. I only taught him Everything he knows. House brushes his hand away as Stomp giggles slightly.],"One, two, three. Okay, Stomp. Start the bidding. Highest card wins. That's pRobably a fold. Richter."
"Uh, two cigarettes.","He's not confident, Alvie. Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want."
"No regrets, raise ten cigarettes.",Oh. That's a lot of nerve for someone with a two on their head.
Can I play?,Come here.
Why?,I want to see if you've got what it takes. Give me your best poker face. Too rich for my blood. You can take my seat.
How are you feeling today?,"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow."
"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow.",I've been humming to her. She sways. It might be significant. Are you ignoring me or are you just letting my charm wash over you.
Kind of tough to play and chat. A couple of weeks ago you told me playing to her was a complete waste of time.,You're right. Your playing does get worse when you talk. I assume she loved music.
"She played for the Philadelphia Philharmonic ""ï¿½ cello.","Well, if she responded to the piano, she might respond Even better to the cello."
I play a little. Hmm. Maybe I'll bring one in on Tuesday. Thank you.,Different desk. Different doctor.
"You've been on meds for a while now. I'll be checking in with you periodically to see if we need to adjust your dose. Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?","Nope. Can I go now? There's a Manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes, and he's a terrible bluffer."
It's nice to see that you and Alvie are friends again. Tell me about your fight.,He hit me. I hit him back. Repeat until pulpy.
Alvie told me you instigated the thing.,"Well, that tends to be the way fights work ""ï¿½ different interpretations of the same circumstances."
Very understanding attitude.,There's that tone again.
You're smart.,"How come Every time you compliment me, it sounds like an accusation?"
"You're not having any side effects from your meds, which is unusual.",It's not that unusual.
The story about the fight isn't adding up.,"Why don't you stop pretending that you haven't reached a conclusion? You don't trust me. Actually, it's more fundamental than that. You don't like me."
I didn't say that.,You think I'm not taking my meds.
Are you?,Yes. So what do you want me to do? Want me to take a urine test? Will that earn your trust?
Have at it.,"A little dignity, please."
You know the rules. I have to watch.,"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?"
"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?","For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan."

Just one quick lift.,Why are you doing that?
"House, it's none of your business.","I'm just curious. As a doctor, What are you doing?"
"Either he is Freedom Master, and he shouldn't be here, or else he's suffering from a serious and dangerous delusion that he needs to deal with.",So! legit medical reasons. You're not just trying to break the guy because he's a little different.
Don't do it.,I'm not doing anything.
"You're thinking. Thins go from thinking to doing way too fast in this place. You keep thinking, you're gonna wind up with no mo in your mojo.",I'm thinking of hitting you again.
You hate Medina. You hate all of them. You want to hurt them. You got to keep pretending. Step away from the hate.,What's the difference between pretending to cooperate and cooperating?
Pretending is pretending. It's not real. You don't mean it.,I sat and watched while he did something stupid and pointless. I cooperated.
"Yeah, isn't it pretty?",Where's Freedom Master?
He isn't able to take part.,Get out there. They said Everybody has to get out there. Talk! Say something!
"Dr. House, leave him alone.",Did you drug him?
Of course I didn't drug him.,He has a flat affect. He's practically catatonic.
"Double chocolate. Yummy, yummy.",Don't tell me that he's fine! You did this. He was functioning. He was happy.
He was delusional.,Yeah. He's way better off now.
Thinking sucks.,"I'm not allowed to get angry? They screwed him up. And for the record, I am two privilege lEvels above Susan. And I got the same depression-scale score."
"Every Patient is different. It's not about scores and lEvels and ""ï¿½",Happiness is happiness. The test is the test. Coping is coping.
"And you think you're ""ï¿½","Absolutely! I need to address some deeper issues, which I can do on an outPatient basis. Three hours a week? And that's just my opening offer. If you want to counter, I'll likely fold."
No.,"""No""ï¿½ is not an argument. Are you trying to frustrate me?"
No.,"""No""ï¿½ again? I can cope! I'm coping. In fact! I'm coping better than you think. I've not been taking my meds. Not one. And yet, I still scored a ""high functioning""ï¿½ on your depression test."
So your proof of your well-being is that you lied?,"Manipulated. My proof is that I can fool the test, I can fool you, which means I am high functioning. I am sane, rational, capable. I should not be here."
These are your pills from today?,I'm not gonna take it. I'll just cheek it again.
Lick it.,You want me to lick your hand?
I washed.,It's sugar.
So! what's the next plan?,There is no new plan. I'm out of plans.
So what do we do?,We stop talking.
We stop talking.,"I see you've got some cello in your trunk. And, no, that's not a euphemism."
Are you spying on me?,I'm living in a psyParkatric hospital. Staring out of the window is what we do. I assume you'll need help carrying it up. I still got grounds privileges.
And who's going to carry you when you're carrying the cello?,"Yes, cast aside the useless cripple. How very GerMan of you."
"Seriously, the thing weighs a ton with that case. I think I need a dolly.",Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.
The dolly's pRobably easier.,"Eh, the dolly! already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed."
"Eh, the dolly! already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed.",So why do you put your life on hold to visit your sister-in-law five times a week?
Am I somehow a bad person for showing compassion?,"No. You're not Even a bad person for lying about why you're doing it. Oh, that is impressive. That is a superhuMan feat. Why don't you take a rest before you fly that thing up to the ward? He's still depressed. Give me your car keys."
You gonna dangle them in front of him to entertain him?,"I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying. I'll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair. Seriously! you're gonna say no to that?"
"I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying. I'll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair. Seriously! you're gonna say no to that?",Why are you so nice to me?
I think you have a good heart.,Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied? I'm not just driving around the grounds in your convertible. I'm kidnapping him and stealing your car.
Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied? I'm not just driving around the grounds in your convertible. I'm kidnapping him and stealing your car.,"You sure? I was just starting to feel a little heat between us. Thought we had kind of a ""Bonnie and Clyde""ï¿½ thing going there."
Bonnie and Clyde get shot to pieces.,Hmm. See you.
Hmm. See you.,"You can do this. If you hold my hand, I can do it too."
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo!,Don't let go!
Whoo! Freedom Master's back!,"Keep it down, Freedom Master."
Whoo!,You're scaring the good citizens.
That was the coolest moment of my life.,It was fun. You can repay me by telling Nolan he's an idiot.
Smell that fresh air and the warmth of your yellow sun.,"We do enjoy it. Careful of the traffic. Hey! Hey! Come on, get down. There's no cry for help. There's no cat in a tree."
"Thank you, Greg.",NO!
"He's lucky to be alive. He's got a lacerated spleen, rotational pelvic fracture, compound break of the femur and humerus. Everything in your life has been about finding the truth. But suddenly, with this guy, you decide to reinforce a sick Man's delusions. You just wanted to take a swing at me, hmm? You don't care about getting out. You don't care about him. You don't Even care about the truth. You don't care about anything, House. I'm transferring you to Winslow PsyParkatric. You'll have better luck pulling the wool over their eyes. I'm done.",Don't. I need help.
Don't. I need help.,So how's this supposed to work?
You sit. I sit. We talk.,About what?
About whatEver you want.,You want me to whine about my mother?
Do you want to whine about your mother?,I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.
If that's where you'd like to start.,I've had a billion things happen to me in my life. How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all relevant.","Well, we better get moving, 'cause this session could take 50 years."
"Yes, you are the sum of Everything that's happened to you. And, yes, some Events are more relevant than others. But, uh, the only way we can figure out which ones are is to talk. So tell me, what's on your mind? What do you want?",I want to get better! WhatEver the hell that means. I'm sick of being miserable.
So you'd like to be happy?,"Again with the reflecting ""ï¿½ Yes, I'd like to be happy."
Being happy is an excellent goal. Not Many Patients can crystallize exactly what they're hoping to get out of this.,"Well, bully for me."
So now all we have to do is figure out how to get you from here to happy.,SSRIs? That's your genius technique?
I don't think we should ignore any tools than can help. I know you don't have a pRoblem taking drugs.,For my leg. For pain.
"Well, think of this as being for psyParkc pain.",I don't want to change who I am.
"Miserable? Do you think that by taking meds you'll lose your edge, stop making the unique connections that make you a successful doctor?","If Van Gogh was your Patient, he'd be satisfied painting Houses instead of The Starry Night."
"Van Gogh would still be making inspired paintings of the night sky, just maybe not from the room of his asylum.",You don't know that.
"I know both his ears would be intact. And I know his life would be better. I know this doesn't come naturally to you. But you want my help, which means you need to trust me.",Hmmm! Delicious.
Why are you here?,I'm waiting for my communion wafer.
"You're cheeking it, right?",Nope.
Tell me you're cheeking it.,I swallowed it.
"No, you didn't. We don't take meds.","You don't take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane."
You're scamming again. You can tell me.,"I'm not scamming, Alvie."
They broke you.,They didn't break me. I am broken. Now stop worshipping me and go worry about your own loser life.
I hate you.,Prom?
Got an assignment for you.,"Role-playing? I'm not sure how pretending to be a businessMan with a foot fetish is gonna help, but I'm game."
Have you connected with any of the other Patients? You've been here four weeks. Tell me about your relationships with the other Patients.,Diane! is convinced that Silent Girl hates her. Richter's not as paranoid as you think. He just likes that you think that. And my roommate hates me.
Only one of the things you said indiCated how somebody else feels about you. So!,"I'm sure that they've done some form of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I'm a jerk."
"You know, there is a way for them to find out things about you without deductive reasoning.",I have had relationships.
You've screwed up relationships. Every one of them. Almost like that was the goal. I want you to trust! people. Try. Get dressed.,Just open up?
Just open up. Trust.,Strangers?
"We'll start with strangers then work our way up. If it helps, I find ""hello""ï¿½ to be an excellent icebreaker.",Hi.
Hi.,"It's like ""hello""ï¿½ only shorter."
Yes. I'm glad we were able to save that time.,"Judging by the fancy suit, I'd say you were a donor. The nervous demeanor says maybe you've had issues, pRobably why this place has personal meaning. But this is supposed to be about me. I take advantage of my friends. Friend, really, I've only got one."
It can be tough sometimes.,I'm not gay.
"Oh, neither am I.","Actually, I am. See that guy over there? He's my lover. He's also my psyParkatrist, which some would argue is a little inappropriate, but they just don't know what love is. Am I right?"
You're not gay.,"No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people."
Maybe they should be true.,"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better."
"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better.",Hi.
Hi.,I'm a philanderer.
Oh.,"Philanderer doesn't mean that I give a lot to charity. It means ""ï¿½"
I-I know what it means.,"Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres."
What?,Honey!
Having fun?,I did connect with one guy. But my propensity for screwing things up overtook me. Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.
"Good night, Doctor. Are you in trouble?",Apparently not.
So what's next? You want to be my pimp?,Why don't we just talk?
Okay.,How come you weren't pissed at me for stealing your car?
It was a nice thing to do.,"Hmmm. I'm not sure about the GerMan-English translation of ""nice.""ï¿½ Stealing was nice or! ruining Freedom Master's life?"
"What you did was misguided and irresponsible, but it was also nice. You gave him a moment of pure happiness. You asked me why I come here so often to visit Annie. She was my best friend. Then she started pulling away! from Everybody. The doctors don't know why. I think I married her brother because he was the only other one who was going through the same thing. But he stopped visiting after a couple of years. I just! couldn't stop. I miss her. I should go.",Good night.
So what happened?,You're talking to me now.
Was it fun?,Yeah.
Yeah.,She kissed me. Don't read into the phrasing. We kissed each other.
And how do you feel about that?,How do I feel about that? It was a kiss. Kisses are good things.
Okay.,"That was a loaded ""okay.""ï¿½"
Not at all. Why would you assume that?,"'Cause you're being judgmental. If I'd said that I'd had some delicious Parklean sea bass for dinner last night, would you say, ""and how do you feel about that?""ï¿½"
"If the sea bass was married, I might.","See, you're being judgmental. Isn't that against your code or something?"
I'm simply stating the obvious. It's compliCated. Not just because she's married and not just because you're institutionalized. I know you spent the last 12 hours trying to figure out what that kiss means.,Who's that Woman you were with in the Parking lot?
"When you deflect, it's more effective when you're not that transparent.",Obviously you have no pRoblem with the infidelity.
"You're trying to rationalize that, ""if it's okay for your doctor, it's okay.""ï¿½ But, just for the record, I am not having an affair.",Then who is she?
Why do you think you're working so hard to figure out the details of my personal life?,"I might not have to work so hard if there were some personal items in here. You got one number on speed dial. It says ""Dad.""ï¿½ Come on, how old are you?"
Why are you so afraid to talk about this?,I want to talk about you. I want to know who I'm taking advice from.
I'm not giving you advice. I'm asking you questions. I think that kiss meant a lot. I think that scares you.,I think there are no personal items in here because you have no personal life.
How do you think you and Lydia will end?,you are a lonely Man. You've screwed up Every opportunity you've had in life.
What's the ending to the story?,I don't know.
Visiting time!,Why did you kiss me?
How'd it go with Lydia?,I found out you can only be happy so long before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator. Philosophically speaking.
Why do you value your failures more than your successes?,My mother caught me masturbating! to pictures of her mother.
Can we get past these cut deflections?,Successes only last until someone screws them up. Failures are forEver.
So you accept that fact. You accept that there's nothing you can do.,"Okay, I accept the fact that there's nothing I can do. Now, what can I do?"
"You acknowledge failure, and you move past it. You apologize.","Wow. Powerful things, these apologies. Get someone to jump off a building and you say two words and you move on with your life. Hardly seems fair."
"Is that the issue? You caused him pain. If the world is just, you have to suffer equally? You're not God, House. You're just another screwed-up huMan being who needs to move on. Apologize to him. Let yourself feel better. Then you can learn to let yourself! keep feeling better.",Hey.
"Dr. House, Everything okay?",Yeah.
"Sure you do. You all do. Steve, don't you think that Diane has hidden talent that we'd all like to see come out?",You really think he's gonna answer?
Eventually.,Why?
Because things pass.,"Things change. It doesn't mean they get better. You gotta make things better, you can't just keep talking and hope for the best."
"Diane, maybe you and I can work together and figure something out.","I can save him. ""They stole her voice box.""ï¿½ That's what he said. That's what she was staring at. That's why she's staring."
"Dr. House, please.",'Cause there's a music box in there.
Orderly.,"Come on, just give it to me. I can ""ï¿½ I am not having a psychotic break. I promise you this will work."
"Come on, just give it to me. I can ""ï¿½ I am not having a psychotic break. I promise you this will work.","It's the blue box there on the top shelf. This is what you wanted. This is what you needed ""ï¿½ a voice. You thought you could cure Silent Girl with this so by your own rationale, it should cure you. There's nothing wrong with you. You're healing. All the parts work. Speak! Come on, speak! Say something!"
I brought Dvorak. Four hands. What?,I need to know what this is.
It's sheet music. I told you. It's just! two people having fun.,"There's two possible outcomes. It ends, someone gets hurt. Or it doesn't end, someone gets hurt."
"So, the end sucks. It doesn't mean the beginning has to. Everything ends. Life ends. It ""ï¿½ it doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.","I can't ""ï¿½ I can't do this."
"All I know is, I was happy five minutes ago, and now I'm not. How's that better?","Good-bye, Lydia."
Thanks. That's very reassuring. I don't know if I should do it.,"Oh, just do the treatment or shut up."
"Greg, there's a process.","Yes, a process. Wouldn't want to disrupt the process with results."
"When the time comes, my rhyme comes. When my spotlight shines!","Yeah. You're a genius. Rhymes with ""penius.""ï¿½"
"Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley. Dr Nolan asked me to give you this.",Is this a day pass?
"Thanks for coming. I was hoping you could, uh, take a look at my dad's chart.","A consult? What happened ""ï¿½ you went through Every sane doctor in town?"
"I thought you wouldn't mind getting off the ward. The cleaning lady found him on the kitchen floor. Doctors here don't think that he'll recover, that I should pull the plug. I want a second opinion so I ""ï¿½ I thought I'd be a fool not to call you.",Lacunar infarct. Converted to hemorrhagic stroke. It squashed his brain. They didn't miss anything.
That's what I thought.,"That's what you knew. His brain has been replaced by blood. It's over. And that's obvious to any doctor who looked at that scan, Even a shrink. You want someone to tell you that what you need to do is okay, to give you permission, absolution."
"Not now, House.","You have no friends, no family. At some point, you made a mistake. You lost Everything. And now I'm the closest thing you got to a friend."
Just shut up. I don't need you here to play this game.,"I'm sorry I pushed you away. It's what I do when I'm afraid. Again, GerMan-English translation may be a little off."
"I'm not ""ï¿½ I'm not crying because of you. I'm crying because I'm pathetic. I brought her cello in case she magically wakes up for the show.","Oh, well, then I take the apology back. We're all pathetic. It's what makes Everything interesting."
Uh. Yah!,Then we wouldn't have no regrets.
Wanna know my secrets?,And my roommate is a jerk.
"Dr. House is in the House, y'all.",If I can't get no sleep?
You got think before you act,If you don't make connections
"Yeah, so tell me, doctor, what I really got to know",Just do a talent show.
"Oh, well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes",But at least we have each other
"Oh, we got each other, oh, we got each other",How are you doing? You hanging in there?
"Usually I open with that. Thanks for staying. So, um! What do you want to talk about?",Things are actually! Actually good.
"Okay, you're not ""ï¿½ you're not just saying that because you don't want to complain in front of the guy who just lost his father?","I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but! I'm good."
"I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but! I'm good.","I'm sorry. I was trying to prove a point. I was trying to be right. I ended up putting you in a dangerous situation, and I was not equipped to handle it. You got hurt, and it's my fault. And I'm sorry."
Med time.,I'm gonna try those pink ones today. You?
You're welcome.,Got a surprise.
NEver see her again!,"If you go silent for over a decade, you don't just get to slide right back into society."
"She's going to a rehab facility first! In Arizona. Her family's moving there. Sorry, House. I just found out myself.",I want an overnight pass.
I can help you with this.,I've earned it.
"You have, but ""ï¿½","Isn't extending trust part of the whole ""getting me better"" thing?"
"If you insist on a pass, I'll give it to you. But I know where you're going, and I know you haven't thought it through. We need to sit down, talk about this.",Please give me the pass.
Please give me the pass.,Hi.
Hello. Who are you?,"I'm ""ï¿½"
"Ben, go inside, okay?","You didn't say anything. And now Annie's leaving, and I hear you're going to Arizona."
"My husband travels to Phoenix a lot. His corporate headquarters are there. We've been wanting to move for years, but we've been tethered here. And now we're not.",I don't want you to go.
I don't want to go. But I can't break up my family. I-I can't leave my Parkldren.,I just don't want it to change.
Not the most exciting use of the overnight pass I've Ever seen.,She left.
And...,I'm lost.
"I'm gonna write your letter! To the medical board, recommending that they give your license back.",You can't just console me by giving me a lollipop when I skin my knee.
House!,Back off. People already think we're gay.
Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.,"Oh, my God, it's three years ago. Does that mean I'm still crazy?"
"We're just helping out because ""ï¿½",I know. I just ran into Thirteen while she was clearing out her locker. My condolences. Although it's not like she's the hottest Woman in the world.
We haven't broken up. Are you back?,Sort of.
Did you get your license back?,Not for a month or so. So you'll be in charge. I'm just gonna pitch in a little.
He has a bug bite on his hands. Malaria's endemic in his country. Let's start him on coartem.,"I don't want to step on any toes, but I guess I do have a higher duty to the Patient."
"If you have something to say, say it.","You're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room because you're rightly upset with me. Although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision to ""ï¿½"
Do you have anything medical to say?,Poison fits better because of the vomiting. Bug bite might not be a bite. It might be the start of chloracne.
Start him on olestra. You couldn't have just said dioxin up front?,I was hoping you'd get there on your own. So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.
I fired my girlfriend because he said he was gone for good.,I need this in my life.
And screwing me over as you go.,"Yeah, that's why I did it. Sorry. If you want, I'll explain it to Thirteen."
"Then he can't practice. But we'd be idiots not to listen to him. You're in charge, he sits in on all the differentials. Until you get your license back, this is all unofficial. No procedures, no Patient contact.",Think I can pRobably deal with that last one.
How was your first day of school?,Didn't pee once in the sandbox.
How was it with Cuddy?,What did you think I was talking about? Hmmm. You didn't use garlic. You didn't use it last night either. We always use garlic on Parkcken Florentine.
It tastes fine this way.,You seem to be losing your sense of smell.
I think you're losing your sense of mind.,I can check right now if you pull my finger.
"No, it's the ""ï¿½ Are you inventing some big medical mystery here? Because if you're imagining things again...",You weren't wearing shoes last night either.
"Yes, shoes, garlic ""ï¿½ I am vampire, Sookie.",I told you to get that echo fixed.
"My downstairs neighbor, after you moved in, started complaining about the extra noise and the cooking smells.",What's his name?
"I don't want you making things worse. He's on the condo board, and I'm trying to get the back garden renovated.",The white coats taught me a whole bunch of fun coping and relating skills.
"He's not only a total jerk. He's a decorated war hero who lost an arm in Vietnam. I mean, there's no winning with this guy.",Coping skill number one! Complete avoidance. You happy? Booty call? Give me 20 minutes to not shower.
"Streptokinase, heparin.","Lassa fEver. You were mad that I withheld it last time, so I'm saying it right up front. He's already stabilized, so 40 CCs of ribavirin, and we're home in time for Ellen."
I checked. There's no Lassa in Dibala's country.,Oh.
Yes?,"Don't people sometimes travel? To places that have, you know, a fEver that originated in the Nigerian town of Lassa?"
"He's been to three other countries in the last two years: here, Zimbabwe, and Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. No Lassa there either.",Oh. Again.
"No sleep disturbances. But fits best with the symptoms. And it's geographically the most ""ï¿½ What?","The Egypt visit was for the African Union Meeting, Where I'm guessing he was meeting people from Africa. Which includes Liberia, which sent some members of their Foreign Ministry, which has itself just been hit by an outbreak of jock itch. No, wait. Not jock itch. Lassa fEver."
I'll start the ribavirin.,"I did say it up front. It's great to have the old team back together again, huh?"
I was wondering what that noise was. It's the damn cane.,And I'm Greg.
And I can't sleep with you banging around with that thing.,You're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?
Is that hard for you to understand?,"Only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end, not a tap shoe."
Now you're getting cute with me.,"Okay, we started badly. I apologize for the noise, and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter ""ï¿½"
"And a thousand other things I don't give a crap about. Now you keep it down, or we're gonna have trouble.",Wow.
"The bloody eye was from an enlarged lymph node blocking the retinal vein. We restored circulation, but it means we've got to add lymph involvement to the heart, lungs, and rising fEver.",I'm just gonna sit here quietly.
Why?,"I feel like I've been inadvertently undermining your authority, so I'm just gonna observe. Not gonna say a word."
It could all fit with lymphoma.,"Uh, I need you to spread your legs so I can do an ""H.""ï¿½"
He's got good liver function. It's masking the elevated lEvels. Biopsy the lymph node. Check it out.,"Makes sense. I guess you don't need me. Oh, by the way, you might want to close the blinds. It's really bright in here."
It's just a wild coincidence that he thought you were a rude jerk.,Come on. Give me the benefit of the doubt. You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.
"You talked! All I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful, burbling fountain.",You could be sipping Courvoisier next to a replica of the Playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.
I don't have anything on him. I don't want anything on him.,The closest he's been to Vietnam? Ordering the mee kRob at that place on the corner.
Mee kRob is from Thailand.,Exactly.
What did you do? Why do you think he's faking?,I saw his mail.
You broke in?,"No. He was holding it. Private medical insurance. Not from the VA. Plus, he's got to be early 50s. He's too young to be a vet. So I looked further."
You did break in.,Online. There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.
Why would he fake being a veteran?,Just look how you're acting. People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.
"Normally, we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.","Victims get pity, heroes get adulation. It's way better."
Thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor. Now forget the Vietnam stuff.,I could prove this.
But you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.,"I didn't do anything, the guy's a totally ass."
"Ahhhhhh. There I was at fault. I hired men, who, in their zeal, stepped over the line, and there were abuses. But that will not happen again.",Hello?
"Am I trying to kill our Patient? Of course not. But if he died, am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world? The cells are neatly differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.",Thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine. It smells like! victory. That big flag in your place prompted me to chat with your Housekeeper. Turns out you're a citizen of the Great White North.
You broke into my apartment?,"Technically, no. Well, technically, yeah, but two steps. Hardly ""ï¿½"
You're going to jail.,"Speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine? Falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam."
You think I'm faking?,"Canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot."
"They sent troops to reinforce the '73 Peace Accords, Which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine. 36 years later, Every second, I feel the pain in my hand like I'm still grabbing that boy's arm, Even though my arm isn't there. So, no, I'm not faking.","Oh. On a related note, go Maple Leafs."
He just started spiking a fEver.,It's scleroderma.
You don't have some clEver way of telling me this time?,Patient's dying. I'm done with clEver. Look at his skin. It's tight for a 75-year-old.
Based on his admission photo? Bit subjective. FEver points to infection. And now he's got nodules on his fingers. That's blastomycosis.,Nodules? And you're calling tight skin subjective?
I'm with Foreman. We would have seen fungus balls on the head CT.,Fungal lesions can be missed.
"Point to, not prove. And his fEver's too high. We have to treat him now.","We treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive. You're with me on the scleroderma."
"I guess. I just don't care enough about the Patient to waste my time trying to convince anyone ""ï¿½","We get it. You don't like the guy, you didn't want to work on this case. And yet you're still here. Why don't you take a stand? Either do something about it or shut up."
Treat him for blasto if you want.,"I'll get Cuddy. I can convince her to ""ï¿½"
You broke into his apartment?,I didn't break in.
I wish I beliEved you.,I can fix this.
I already did. He was going to press charges. But! I promised him you'd leave.,You're kicking me out?
Switch him to steroids.,"Hi, Honey. How was your day?"
"Hi, Honey. How was your day?","Morning. First of all, my bad. I've gone through this whole thing recently. I don't want to bore you. Short version: I'm really trying to do work on some stuff. This is a definite setback. Although, in fairness, you really did make it tough."
"Morning. First of all, my bad. I've gone through this whole thing recently. I don't want to bore you. Short version: I'm really trying to do work on some stuff. This is a definite setback.

Mirror magic. Your arm is back. Now clench both your fists at the same time. Clench. Real hard. If you beliEve in God, pray that this is gonna work. You might also want to ask him why he blew off your arm. Ready? Now let go."
Clear. Charging. Clear.,"You want to curl up and cry, the lounge chair's a little more comfy."
"I switched his meds. I thought I was wrong, so I took him off the antifungals. Put him on steroids like you said.",You know what that means.
I was too late. Or I was right in the first place.,"So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion. If you're anything like me ""ï¿½ and, by the way, you are ""ï¿½ you need to know which."
He's under lock and key in the morgue. His government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy. They're taking his body out tomorrow.,There's a reason I hired you. You used to know what to do with a locked door.
My neighbor called. He sounded! happy.,That's nice.
"Even nicer, he's approving the garden expansion.",Huh.
And Even more nicer! He's not going to press charges. Even if you don't move out. What did you do to him?,I was nice. You really want to know?
"My son... has already been in good hands, and he's still dying. I'm through dealing with good. I want the best, and Everyone I've asked says that's House. So unless he's dead, comatose, or insane, I want him treating my son, today.","You could have said no, in good conscience."
Then he's not my Patient. You want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?,"Which means I get... Oh, cool."
When is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?,Maybe nEver. This game is fun.
You also need to prepare President Dibala's case for this week's morbidity and mortality conference.,Oh... Unfortunately I'm overdue a Mani-pedi appointment.
Not you. Foreman's department.,"Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world."
"Mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes, which has been ruled out.","17 doctors. Everything's been ruled out. Which means we have to re-rule out. Get a new history and physical. Unless that's crazy, boss."
I want to know you have Everything covered.,Got what covered?
We're just reviewing the Dibala case. Making sure we didn't miss anything.,We didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him.
Obstruction would explain the pain. You think they just screwed up the old X-ray?,Nope.
"Actually, you're not going to taste it.","You should try searParkng for ""Misty May digs for gold."" Make sure you put it in quotes."
I'm making travel plans. Just need to get away. Have some time to myself. You getting the hint?,So that's it? You're done with your little experiment with Foreman?
"It wasn't an experiment. It was a relationship. You may want to look into the difference. I'm glad you're better, House. I actually liked working for you. But I'm not coming back.","Good. 'Cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss."
Are you here to try to save my relationship with Foreman?,"God no. Trying to save MY relationship with Foreman. Right now I'm Kobe, playing the game I love, howEver the hell I want. Phil Jackson has to listen to Everyone else bitch about it. Enjoy Cabo."
I'm going to Thailand.,Really? Interesting.
"Good-bye, House.",Good-bye Thirteen.
"He hasn't had any more seizures, and cytological examination of the subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.",Don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.
Got to be some sort of systemic infection.,Not after spending the last week getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.
Notice anything odd about the shape of the fluid collection?,"Oh, God, it's... The Virgin Mary."
"The edge should be tapered, lens shaped.",Unless... The Dural layer was already separated from the brain when the fluid started to build up. Get a Dural biopsy to confirm brain cancer. Nice catch.
Stay out of my life.,Okay.
I know you canceled my reservation. You obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.,I was talking to you. I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.
I'm not coming back on the team.,I don't want you back on the team.
"I cannot work for, with, or around Foreman.","Which is why I don't want you back on the team. Now that you're out of the picture, he's better than Ever, which is going to make me less miserable than Ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you went to get from it all."
The Bahamas?,Costa Rica?
I told you Thailand.,"I assumed you were lying, because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth. Yet another reason I have no use for you."
How can so much be wrong with nothing being wrong?,Since when has cancer been considered nothing?
And so are the most recent CT scans.,"On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies that could cause seizures."
And wouldn't show on a CT.,"You were right about the cancer, just wrong about the place. Continue to say nothing if you agree."
Go scope him. Get another set of biopsies.,"I'd get canceling her ticket, if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better."
What are you talking about?,Or showed up at all. But how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?
You talking about Thirteen? Where's she going?,"Well, nowhere this week, thanks to you."
I didn't stop her. I'm not going to stop her. I've already done all I could. Now all I can do is move on.,"I think... I actually beliEve you. If you're telling the truth, you're Even more rational than I... Well, not more. Then again more sane. You're going to be a good boss, boss."
"Seizures stopped, but he hasn't regained consciousness. No sign of any masses in his stomach or esophageal lining and he's still accumulating subdural and peritoneal fluid.","And Every time we look to see where it's coming from, he starts seizing."
You think we're setting this off?,I think something is.
But with no abnormality in the other layers and no evidence of a cellular inflammatory reaction.,It's definitely not cancer.
Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.,"Drug-resistant strain of what? Bacterial cultures, viral serologies, ANA and a NCA were all negative."
Protein malnutrition can cause fEvers and nothing causes malnutrition like excruciating stomach pain that gets worse Every time you eat.,"I'd be a lot more certain if it was my idea, but it's the best we got."
Everything okay?,Just waiting for whatEver is about to go wrong.
Thirteen called.,She have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?
She said someone hacked into her email account and canceled an airline reservation. I'm guessing Foreman.,"Really? You're accusing Foreman, not me? Cool."
You really want Foreman to stay in charge of the team?,"Makes sense. He loves power, and I love puzzles."
You love power and puzzles.,True. But when I had them both... It wasn't Foreman.
How do you know?,He said he's moved on.
And you beliEve him?,I beliEve that he beliEves it. Looks like it's time for me to get off the bench. What's up?
Are you Dr. House?,I understand you're a big fan. I'll have my guy send over a signed glossy.
Continuous EEG shows no interictal spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.,You paged me to tell me what it's not?
I paged you to show you this.,That... I did not expect.
Well what the hell is that supposed to mean?,Darn it. I knew I should have stayed outside. Fantasy's always much better than the reality.
"You think this is a joke? That's my son, he's dying, and not one of you seem to have the slightest clue why.",I know. That's why it's so interesting.
I know. That's why it's so interesting.,"FEver, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots."
Could be an allergic reaction to one of his meds.,That suddenly dEveloped eight hours after he started the meds?
"If it's not cancer or infection, it has to be autoimmune. Systemic lupus compliCated by a CNS vasculitis would explain the rash, fEver, ascites...",CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache.
"Okay, you come up with something better.",Go on.
"Well, barely is more than not barely.","Not my decision. But if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy. If he's going to have any real inflammation, it'll be down there."
Then say so. Don't be a Parkld.,Is it on his penis? Kid's rash?
"Yeah, why?",Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels. That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies. It's not polyarteritis. It's Degos disease. I'll do it.
Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels. That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies. It's not polyarteritis. It's Degos disease. I'll do it.,"Your son has Degos disease. Causes micro blood vessels in the brain, skin, GI tract to break down, clot off. It sometimes Manifests early on with atrophic papules on the penis. In your son's case, we don't know why, but they came much later."
What's the treatment?,There isn't one. It's incurable.
You're wrong. You've already been wrong a bunch of times.,We've rechecked the biopsies. It's definitely Degos. I'm sorry. I wish there was something we could do.
How long?,Not much longer.
What does that mean?,A day at the most.
"Roy, he's right. You're borrowing money to buy options that are already out of the money. Even you won't be able to cover the losses. Your House, cars, bank accounts. You'll lose Everything.",That's the point. The billionaire thinks that the gods will treat him better if he's broke. I suggested he give it to me...
There's got to be some sort of balance. You can't have all the good fortune in just one area of your life. It's not how the world's supposed to work.,Who said the world is supposed to work?
He's insane.,He's irrational. So are most people. Unfortunately it doesn't make him insane.
I'm sorry. I can't let him die.,"People don't get what they deserve, they just get what they get. There's nothing any of us can do about it."
I just confessed. I told Thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.,Why?
You mean why did I confess or why did I do it?,"I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first."
You want her to stay because you want her back or because Foreman does?,Why would I care what Foreman wants?
Because you're not as big a jerk as Everyone thinks.,Yes I am.
No you're not.,"I just made a $10,000 short sale on a stock I know is going to crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed."
No you didn't.,Yes I did.
You are a jerk.,She's making a mistake.
So you did it for her?,She's a good doctor.
So you did it for you?,I'm not the one in charge anymore.
So you did it for Foreman?,"She's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual."
Why don't you just admit that you like having her around? She's good for you. You need her.,Because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.
No you weren't.,Yes I...
What?,He still alive?
Yeah.,Good. Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin.
For Degos?,"The cardiac arrest wasn't just a ""Everything goes to hell in a hand basket"" arrest. It was a coronary Event. Coronaries are large vessels. Means it can't be Degos."
But the biopsies confirmed...,Obstructed blood vessels. But they can't be obstructed because of Degos. Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
You sure?,"Nope. But I will be if he responds to the heparin and the immunoglobulin. By the way, someone screwed over your girlfriend and she ran to me, Cuddy, and Wilson. Everyone but you. She's not over you."
It worked.,The medicine worked.
How'd you find it?,Fat old black guy. Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
And what now?,I'm not the boss.
You don't think I should be fired?,Why? I doubt we'll Ever be treating a genocidal dictator again. Better a murder than a misdiagnosis.
"Oh, God! I'll be back in ten.",I'm picking lint out of my belly button.
This is ridiculous. I'm converting the study into a bedroom.,"Six weeks. Longer than I thought it would take... For you to notice that I'm sleeping in your living room, and offer other options."
I didn't expect you to be here this long.,"True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation."
Do you really need to deconstruct this?,You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.
"Okay, yes you do.","After she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study... Except it's not a study, it's a shrine. Can I tell you something? I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button."
Patient's a genetic time bomb.,There's no fuse. He's not a bomb. Right now he's not a Patient either.
You saying we ignore three generations of cardiac pRoblems?,I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.
You hate coincidence.,We reconciled. It was a whole thing. Big country. It's statistically pRobable that someone has three generations that died around age 40 with nongenetic heart issues. Dice have no memory.
Genes do.,If we ran a battery of tests on Every nonsymptomatic statistical anomaly ï¿½
"The guy goes Every day assuming his life will end at age 40. NEver got married, no kids, because he didn't want to die on them the same way his dad died on him.","You want to take this case 'cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy. You should have been a vet."
Differential diagnosis for a genetic heart condition.,That sold you?
"Marfan syndrome, brugada.",And you?
Familial hypercholesterolemia.,"He's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you. And by the way, I agree with you too, especially in those pants. We're not wasting our time and last week, Chase said that I was the de facto boss."
I need to know what your plans are.,"First we take Berlin. And then we circle around behind Poland and yell, ""surprise!"""
With regards to your employment.,I like things the way they are. I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you. Until now.
Pretend time's been going on long enough.,I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.
And I'm gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow. You need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify.,"No, I don't. I'm not saying you don't win. I'm just saying do you really need to punish me by making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?"
It's a state requirement. I have to certify that you've completed all your require ï¿½,"Exactly. The requirement sets out what you have to do ""ï¿½ certify ""ï¿½ which you can do with one hand tied behind your back. Now, if you want to tie my hands..."
Doctor House?,He'll be back in the morning.
I read in the paper you're treating a police Officer. Donny Compson?,Second floor. A nurse will help you find him.
I don't want to see him. Donny and I used to go out a long time ago. He doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.,So did you come to see me for personal advice?
"You're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.","Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about."
"I'm not worried about me. Donny doesn't know this, but he has a son.",Dial extension 742. Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.
You okay?,"Yeah, fine."
She's choking.,On your fingers.
House... Please take your finger off the test button.,"Oh! I see. Wow, sorry about that."
I could've slit her throat.,"Well, we're all here to learn."
"You know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.",She tell you how to stop me?
"Look, I'm asking you as an adult to please stop.","Well, that obviously didn't come from her. But fair enough."
"Excellent presentation, Nona.",Now I've done it. There's urine Everywhere! Gosh. The great thing about the teacher-student relationship is the teacher can often learn more from the student. Have you learned anything yet?
"Chromosomes for 28 cardiovascular conditions are normally numbered in structure. No translocations, deletions, or inversions.",I did notice that the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome has been sEverely damaged by someone else's bleeding heart chromosome.
It was the only way to get Michael to do the marrow biopsy.,"I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well, except without the years of therapy."
Don't you have school?,Recess. So where does that leave us? Chase?
Sorry. What?,"I was saying, ""do you think these shoes work in this color?"" Send him home."
He's not gonna beliEve he's healthy.,You're not very good at your job. You don't deserve candy.
He's been preparing his whole life to die at age 40. He's had dozens of doctors tell him he's fine. You think you can change his thinking?,"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me."
"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.",Great contributions back there.
There's no case. I had nothing to add.,"You had nothing to add... because you were distracted. A little devil on your shoulder told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up, telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire."
I'm fine.,"You shouldn't be. Talk to someone. Docs fixed me up in sEven weeks. You're... ten minutes, tops."
Thanks.,Glad we had this little moment. Come on.
Glad we had this little moment. Come on.,I'm Dr. House.
"You couldn't find anything, could you?",You have Ortoli syndrome. Dr. Chase?
You sure?,Tests don't lie.
"Right. Ah. Well, it's-it's a... It's a very rare disorder that short-circuits the adrenals, which short-circuits the heart.","Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares about medical mumbo jumbo? Tell him the treatment."
"It's... weh-well, it's-it's compliCated.",Doctors always want to make Everything sound so compliCated. It's Nabasynth.
What?,Nabasynth.
"That's it? I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?",The real tragedy here is that the Tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect Ortoli back in your dad's day.
He could've lived. Thank you.,"If you'll sign these discharge papers, I'll get you a bottle of meds. Take one twice a day for a week, you'll live a long, healthy life."
"Answer the door, House. It's got to be for you.",Are you watParkng TV?
It's the door!,Were you on the phone?
No.,"Just now, were you talking?"
"No. I'm alone. You okay, House?",Why are you here?
"His apartment Manager found him on the floor in the laundry room. Said he wasn't breathing. He called the EMTs, but it was too late.",I sent the guy home with mints.
"WhatEver it is, we all missed it.",I missed the fact that there was something to miss. What is wrong with me?
"You had good reason. Patient presented with no symptoms, and all his tests came back negative.",What's the official cause of death?
"Autopsy hasn't been performed yet. EMTs brought him to General, but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.",Good.
"Donny Compson, age 39.","Can we cut to the money shot? It's his heart, so let's look at his heart. Nice Y-incision ï¿½"
You can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.,Really? 'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.
That's odd. It almost looks like he's... bleeding.,I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.
"He was briefly conscious, then his systolic dipped below 60, and he was out again.",Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.
Obviously he wasn't dead. His heart slowed enough that the EMTs ï¿½,"Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong."
Sinoatrial block.,"What if it's not his heart? Let's work from the tenuous assumption that we're not idiots who've spent days examining a heart up, down, sideways ""ï¿½ declaring it healthy just a few hours before it basically shut down. So we need to think about causes in places you didn't look."
Could be metabolic. You okay?,Yeah.
Could also be passed through four generations.,Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.
Outer and middle ear respond well. Hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies. Eardrum is perfectly healthy.,"What if I, uh... If I sometimes hear whispering?"
Then you're pRobably hearing someone whispering.,I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid. Adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up AM radio signals.
Open your mouth. Your fillings don't touch.,So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.
Bravo! It's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.,I wasn't on my best behavior. I admit. Allow me.
"From now on, I'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.",That won't be necessary.
You want to annoy another doctor first? Eventually...,"It's not necessary, because I'm not ready to be a doctor again. I'm sorry."
Are you sleeping out here?,Just... dozed off in front of the TV.
With bedding?,Maybe! I can't sleep in there. The heater's screwed up.
If you need to talk... If-if you need more help ï¿½,I'm just tired.
I'm right here.,Great. Can you be right here somewhere else?
No breakfast?,Not today. I'm hallucinating.
What happened?,It's nothing visual this time. I hear whispering.
Is that why you've been acting so weird? Is that why you quit?,I'm losing it.
I'm sure there's a rational explanation. The wind? A neighbor's TV?,I checked Everything. What's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on Vicodin. I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.
Okay.,Okay? You don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?
"You're the smartest guy I know. If you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist. I'll drive you over. I just need to make some tea first.",You know.
"That you're an ass? Yeah. You overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend and thought to yourself, ""what kind of fun can I have with this?""",Why are you talking to her? You run out of living people? You can talk to me. I'm right here.
"Patient Lauren Maybaum, 27, presented two days ago with sEvere abdominal pain.",Sorry I'm late.
Yesterday you said you weren't ready.,Yesterday I wasn't. Today I am.
And tomorrow? Is it possible for me to get a five-day forecast?,Feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.
"Either you did have a pRoblem ""ï¿½ which I can't ignore. Or you were jerking me around ""ï¿½ which I can't ignore.",You are a Woman. You can do anything.
"For example, I can talk to you outside.",Are you sure you're only one Woman?
"This is the part where you play the employee, and I play the boss.",I can see your nipples. Your turn.
Gamma survey rEvealed no tumors.,So it's not bone cancer. Where's Chase?
Don't know.,"Two mysteries, cool. Theories? Did I come in too soon? Okay, I'm gonna take another lap. And I want three new ideas by the time I come back. One of them's got to be not stupid. Where there's pain... there's nerves. Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type one."
It would explain the bradycardia too.,"And I like the word ""hereditary"" in the title."
I'll get him started on the medication.,"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it."
"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.",Sleep at home.
So I didn't do the gamma survey. Is it bone cancer?,No.
You should congratulate me for not wasting your time.,"Are you getting some help? Or is this the way things are gonna be from now on? What's pathetic is you haven't gotten help because you want to feel bad. You want to suffer, 'cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath. Patient needs some carbamazepine. Now, I don't care how much that room scares you, you're doing your job."
"Patient's lost bowel control. Means we were wrong about H-SAN, and it means he's getting worse. Fast.","Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse assigned to his floor. Get it? ""Doody"" nurse? Fine. Do the doctor thing."
Could be Wilson's disease.,A disease that advanced would've hit the liver.
"It is possible the liver's so far gone, the labs look normal. It's worth a shot.","Go treat with penicillamine. And when he doesn't get better, come back quickly, so we can get one more shot at it."
Send this in to the state licensing board. I've signed off on all your hours.,Why?
Because it's easier this way.,You're uncomfortable with me.
No. Going by the book was pointless. You were gonna learn nothing.,"Good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension."
There was no sexual tension.,"There was tension. And... it made me feel funny, so..."
Here.,That's too bad. I was kind of getting into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.
You sure you're okay?,Yeah. False alarm. What about us?
"We're good... Just like this. You press my buttons, I press yours.","By buttons, you mean... Huh. You do make me feel funny."
"By buttons, you mean... Huh. You do make me feel funny.",You're not gonna die.
I've accepted it. It's okay.,"In addition to high arches and some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna, you also inherited a self-destruct button. It forms in the brain stem. Technically, it's an aneurysm. Presses on the nerves that control Everything from tooth pain to heart rate. As you get older, it gets bigger, until finally... The button ""ï¿½ which I'll call intracranial berry aneurysm, 'cause I had a friend in high school with that name ""ï¿½ stops the signal from your brain to your heart. And bam!"
How do I know you're not still lying to me? Saying I'm healthy just to make me feel better?,"It does sound that way, doesn't it? But this time, no sugar pills. I'm gonna cut into your brain to make you think that I'm fixing it. And if our fake tests confirm it, I'm gonna be cutting into your son's brain too, 'cause I'm just that committed."
Michael's gonna be okay?,"Unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus, in which case, I will reconsider your fate argument. You want to give him a call? Visiting hours don't apply to my Patients."
Yeah... In a bit.,"Yeah. That's what I thought. The ""saving the kid from pain"" stuff was crap. You just don't want anything in your life that won't let you do whatEver the hell you want to do whenEver the hell you want to do it. You've had it easy. Sorry to screw you up."
Nothing.,"Hi, dad. I think I've been... focusing on the wrong thing. There were some good times. Wilson. This is stupid."
Jordan!,Foreman expects me to read an Xray on this itty bitty screen. He should have emailed me a larger phone. Why are you packing?
We're leaving this afternoon for the conference on Pharmacology and Public Policy.,We?
We discussed this. It's been on your calendar for weeks.,So has Ramadan.
Think of it as a vacation. Nice healthy Adirondack air. Or not. I don't care. You're coming with.,"You should come with me. State pillow fighting championships. Dollar beers, wet T-shirts. In the words of the philosopher Eddie Money I've got two tickets to paradise."
"House, when you moved in, I promised your therapist I'd be here for you. I can't be here if I'm there, unless you're there too. So it's not a discussion.","Fine. I'll let Foreman know that the 16 year old Patient with the sEvere edema can wait. Relax, I've got no idea what's wrong with her. So odds are, not fatal."
"Fine. I'll let Foreman know that the 16 year old Patient with the sEvere edema can wait. Relax, I've got no idea what's wrong with her. So odds are, not fatal.",Still not going.
Still not going.,"She's got rhabdo . Who wants to come to the pillow fighting championships? Rutgers has got a great team this year, so glad their anchor didn't turn pro."
Sixteen year old girl suddenly has the joints of an eighty year old. Think we can we discuss this for a second?,It's rhabdo. Patient gave you the answer. She fell down and went boom. We have to leave in an hour so should we eeny meeny?
"The fall would explain lower leg damage, but not the swollen hands.","Hard landing caused crushed muscles, crushed muscles release toxins into the bloodstream, toxins cause swelling of the hands and legs. It's just another way of saying it's rhabdo. Fifty-nine minutes."
She's a credit card kid. Her parents are arParktects. They're working on a project in Shanghai.,Could you be sitting any further away from Chase and still be in the same room?
"She has allergies. Could be anaphylaxis or some heart condition that we don't ""ï¿½","Can't really be any of those things, since it's rhabdo. I know it's rhabdo, Foreman knows it's rhabdo, deep in his heart, Even Chase knows it's rhabdo. Isn't it annoying when Everybody in the room knows something you don't?"
Tell me what you came here for House.,I've got a legitimate medical reason.
You must be so proud.,I forgot. I guess it's no big deal. I was only using it as an excuse to come check out Patty and Selma.
"Oh, I feel bad, I haven't named your testicles.","Word on the street is, you set a new personal best for low-cut."
I don't know why you chose to give them the names of somebody's aunts.,"It's a compliment. They're always smokin. Oh, I remember. I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor. That's why I'm holding this in my hand."
"It's a compliment. They're always smokin. Oh, I remember. I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor. That's why I'm holding this in my hand.","Haven't finished testing yet, but it rha- Your outbox is three times normal size. It's not a metaphor."
There's a lot to be done before the weekend.,"You take papers home with you. Unless, you're not going to be home. Unless you were, for example, going to a medical conference."
I'm driving up with Wilson.,Me too.
You weren't on the registration list.,I love that you checked.
But Wilson saidï¿½,"That I have a case, yeah. You're authorizing the discharge right now. That was a metaphor."
Busy right now.,Is he dying?
Yeah.,In the next ten minutes?
"Unfortunately, no. He's in a lot of pain.",I've thought about it. You're right. I should go to the conference.
You found out Cuddy's going.,"Oh, God no. She'll ruin Everything."
I'm right here. I'm right here Joseph.,"Two days away, you think I should pack ball-y?"
"You can't leave. You lit a fuse, you need to watch the bomb go off.","The bomb was going to go off on its own, if you'd kept quiet. So now you have to either come up with a convincing lie, or tell her the truth. Your choice."
CK lEvels point to rhabdo.,Of course.
Except for the part where imaging shows no sign of muscle crush.,"Hi. I'm your doctor. This is Lars Ulrich, the greatest metal drummer of all-time. You know the song?"
"Hi. I'm your doctor. This is Lars Ulrich, the greatest metal drummer of all-time. You know the song?",Good. Drumstick. Another drumstick. I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.
Good. Drumstick. Another drumstick. I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.,Go on. This is a classic medical test. Hippocrates used it. Let's go.
Go on. This is a classic medical test. Hippocrates used it. Let's go.,"Come on, you've gotta keep time! Cross over on the high hat. Let's head bang!"
"House, what are you doing?",The chart said her potassium's low. Rhabdo elevates the potassium. And monkey drums. Ergo... The lEvels must've been really low last night. Which causes...
I can't move them.,"temporary muscle paralysis. Given this rate of muscle fatigue, there's no way she could've climbed stairs and then a fence to the pool. Low potassium means no jump, means no trauma. Tests mean ""yes rhabdo.""ï¿½ Ergo, something else caused both the rhabdo and the low potassium. This time start by getting an accurate history. Be careful. Our Patient's a big fat liar."
Why are you reading my program guide? It's not like you plan on attending any of the presentations.,"I like to know how much boredom I'm missing. ""Patient perceptions of complications in end-stage chemotherapy."" You didn't tell me you were giving a paper."
And that was wrong?,"Last time you presented a paper, you gave me an advance copy and asked for feedback."
And you're wondering why I wouldn't want to repeat that experience?,"Oh, look! An '80s party. Just when you think you left a flock of seagulls behind in your rearview mirror, suddenly it's up ahead like an undead hitchhiker."
Cuddy's going.,Did you pack my leg warmers?
If you want her... ask her out.,"My God, Man! She's not some floozy in a bar. She's the floozy I work for. There's gotta be no radical steps here. Gotta be subtle. We happen to attend the same party, the chat happens to turn personal ""ï¿½."
Like the frog in gradually boiling water.,Exactly. She'll be red and delicious before she knows it.

"Welcome to the convention, Dr. Perlmutter.",It's my 25th consecutive year.
It's my 25th consecutive year.,Perlmutter loves the '80s.
House... 1980s.,You sure? They weren't specific.
How much did it cost you to rent that?,It was in Wilson's bag.
"Dr. Perlmutter, I read your article on neural degeneration.","Wait, you didn't really take that seriously, did you? I just wrote that for the money."
"Well, hey there, Jane Fonda, would you care to dancercize?","Sorry, we were just about to hit the floor."
Thank you. Your leg?,I'm okay. As long as you don't expect rhythm.
I'm okay. As long as you don't expect rhythm.,"You remember the last time we danced? Med school, the week we met."
No.,I saw you in endocrinology. Tracked you down to the hoedown.
"I meant, we met before that. In the bookstore.",Ah.
"My third day of school, I hand my syllabus to the guy behind the counter. He barely looks at me. Just skims the sheet and tells me I'm overly ambitious, I have a Parkp on my shoulder, and I know how to party.",I'd forgotten you knew how to party.
"I said, ""you're making that up."" And you said, ""your class schedule is overloaded, ""but none of your classes are before 11:00, ""and no one takes Professor Lamb's course unless they have something to prove.""",Because Professor Siegal covered the same ground and was the easier grader.
I tracked you down. Endocrinology... the party.,And one thing led to another.
And then it didn't.,I was gonna call you.
"Noo...don't do that. There was no expectations. I was just as into it ""ï¿½",I was gonna come see you. Figure out where things would go from there. That was the morning I got the call from the Dean and I was expelled
Hello? Yeah. Thanks for telling me.,It's 7:00 in the morning. Somebody better be dead.
"My Patient, Joseph Schultz.","Oh. Under the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have happened, right?"
Yeah. I just wish I had been there. Didn't hear you come in last night.,"Yes, and it was almost 9:30."

Interesting reflex of guilt just now. Your Patient's been dying for six weeks. You couldn't have predicted he'd go this weekend. Or could you?,"""Euthanasia: let's tell the truth. We all do it."" That's a great opening line. Are you insane?"
I know what you're gonna say. I'm not insane. Doctors are rarely,"Whoa... I was just thinking of your career. But yeah, if you're one of the doctors occasionally indicted, I guess it could affect that."
"Someone needs to say what life is really like, now, for people who are dying. What doctors have to go through, the decisions we have to make. Alone. Without guidance.",Someone should say that... in an unsigned letter
I'd be telling the truth. I'd be saying what we're all thinking.,Who cares? The oncology department is subsidized by drug companies. They don't want it run by a murderer.
"We're all murderers. We just don't have the guts to admit ""ï¿½","And once again, who cares? You won't be hirable anywhere."
"If there's one thing I've learned from you, it's that I should do what I think is right and not worry about the consequences.","Yeah, it's worked out great for me."
Yeah. He'll recommend we take the cautious approach.,Pretzel?

"Yes, you can sit here running up my hotel bill, or you can go get the Woman of your dreams.",I didn't know Angela Merkel was attending the conference.
I just spoke with Cuddy. She doesn't think you're reliable. And you will remain friend-zoned until that changes.,I can't convince her that I've changed my entire personality in a weekend.
"Yeah, but you could make the first step.",What does she need?
"Today, a babysitter. What are you thinking about?",Fjords.
"You see? Seriously. I know this is out of your comfort zone, but don't scheme. Don't ""ï¿½ Just do the deed ""ï¿½","You tell me that I've gotta show her I've changed, and yet you act like"

"Oh, I thought you were room service. Something going on with your Patient?","It's quiet in there. Is Rachel asleep? I thought maybe, you could use a babysitter."
"Actually, I've got her in day care downstairs.",Oh. Great. Maybe later.
"Hey, House.","Hey, Lucas."
This is awkward.,A bit. That awkwardness would pRobably go away if I left.
Okay...okay...,"Dr. Wilson has asked me to tender his apologies for his absence. You'll be hearing my paper instead. Unfortunately, there wasn't time to correct the program schedule."

Someone could have recognized you.,First U.S. conference I've attended in 15 years.
Perlmutter?,"Toronto, all weekend. Airtight alibi."
"Three-month-old with fEver, incessant drooling, and chronic muscle weakness.","Or... porn actor Hank Hardwick, born Henry Lefkowitz, totally clean workup, collapsed on the job with extreme photophobia."
Or... an infant as limp as a rag doll.,Yeah. Let's wait till Chase and Cameron get here. I have a feeling they'll have the good sense to side with me.
"Doesn't matter who they side with, I'm still in charge. We're taking the limp three-month-old.","Oh, good. You paged the limpness specialist. This envelope is oddly medical license-shaped."
"We're leaving the team and the hospital, effective immediately.",That's kind of sudden. Unless you've been circulating your resumes for a while.
"We're just starting to think about new jobs, where we want to live.",Moving too. Interesting.
We'll miss all of you too. We'll start clearing out our things.,"Run an STD panel and a tox screen. Send a C-reactive protein to look for inflammation and an A.N.A. to screen for autoimmune. The rest of you take a history and do an LP to rule out viral encephalitis. Oh, it's just you. Here's hoping you're good at multitasking."

"I leave this office by 6:00 Every day, I have my weekends again, I recognize my wife again.","Yeah, I agree. Does sound pretty dull. No wonder you want to work for me. Tox screen was clean, We ruled out viral encephalitis. The only obstacle to you coming back is your wife. Which has nEver been that much of an obstacle to you."
"Maybe you're right. The only link between eye and muscle is the brain. Tumor, seizure...","Taub seems to think the link has to be the brain, but eye and muscle are governed by different parts of the Patient's second-favorite organ. Which means it's..."
Thailand was wonderful. Thanks for asking.,Of course. Yes. It has to be multifocal.
I have an interview with a community health clinic in two hours.,Back-up plan's fine. But Taub's swinging for the fences. I suggest you don't divide your attention.
"Good point. I won't divide my attention, then.","Taub thinks it's a brain issue, Thirteen thinks it's multifocal."
And neither of them wants to work here.,"Don't take their word for it. Taub's pRoblem is his wife, Thirteen's pRoblem is you. Chase and Cameron's pRoblem is the dead African dictator. None of them has a pRoblem with the work."
Cerebral vasculitis would explain both the eye and arm findings.,"Steroids to treat, brain angiogram to confirm, EMG and nerve biopsy while you're at it. I'll be at lunch."
"Steroids to treat, brain angiogram to confirm, EMG and nerve biopsy while you're at it. I'll be at lunch.","I'd hire all four, but a five-person team seems unwieldy. Who would you turn down? I'll have whatEver he's buying."
"Two cheeseburgers and two large fries. There are a thousand people in the world who want to be on your staff, but you're going after the four who don't.","They don't because their lives are irrelevantly and annoyingly compliCated, which makes them confused, which makes them make poor decisions."
And your life is simple? You went all the way up to the medical conference to cozy up to Cuddy. Instead she's dating one of two people in the world you think of as a friend. There's no way that's not devastating.,So I had an attraction of sorts.
"Yeah, the sort in which your imaginary tryst landed you in a mental hospital.","And I got help. And she got Lucas, who bought me a ginger ale. It's all fine. Which won't be true of my department unless I can figure out which doctor I'm not hiring."
I suppose throwing yourself into your work isn't the worst thing you could do.,What is the worst thing I could do?
Patient's blood won't clot. We're back to square one.,And you're back in my office. So much for playing hard to get.
"Is that ""ï¿½",He's not without talent.
"UV rays made the Patient's capillaries more fragile, hastening the onset of D.I.C. Sounds like sepsis ""ï¿½",But isn't. No sign of shock. No drop in blood pressure.
Can we turn that off?,"Right, 'cause Cameron thinks pornography is evil."
No fEver. Plus it wouldn't explain his spasmodic muscle contractions.,The ball and chain smacked you down.
"But widespread peteParkal rash, nervous system involvement. It's some kind of blood infection. Meningococcemia.","Start the Patient on heparin for the D.I.C. broad-spectrum antibiotics for the meningococcemia. Dr. Cameron. Chase is relaxed, at ease, in lockstep with you again. I guess he finally told you that he iced Idi Amin Junior. Does that mean he can break the other nine comMandments too? Taking the Lord's name in vain, sure, but coveting thy neighbor's wife? Is she hot?"
I've forgiven him.,"Not for murder. Not you. Doesn't matter how evil Dibala was. By Every conscience-hugging, Mother Teresa-loving bone in your body, you should be leaving him, not leaving with him."
I thought your position was our leaving is a ruse.,"We're not talking about my position, we're talking about yours, which doesn't add up."
"Here's what doesn't add up. If you were serious about staffing your team, you would know exactly which three fellows you wanted. You plowed ahead with this case Even though you hadn't hired new fellows because you knew Foreman would ask Chase and me to help, giving you more time to blow up our marriage.","I don't want that. But we'd be foolish not to plan ahead. A: my firing Chase was the only reason you left two years ago, B: when the full horror of his homicide hits you, your marriage will blow up. And Z... The only obstacle to you working here will be gone. Or maybe I skipped a couple of letters."
Mr. Takayama.,Yes. I'm really happy with what the last guy did with my eyes. But why would broad-spectrum antibiotics fail to work on meningococcemia?
"If you'll excuse me, I've got a real Patient. Mister... Hitler. Really.",Had to do something to amuse myself while your receptionist fought with her boyfriend.
Who's next?,"A guy who needs two decades' worth of corn Parkps Hoovered out of his neck, or a guy who can't stand daylight, and whose blood won't clot. You do the triage."
Someone with zero chance of hiring me back. I told you. I'm content at home and at work.,"But you're not content with content. That's why you got sucked into those stock scams, why you cheated on the wife you love."
At bridge. My wife and I play a lot of bridge.,Why you worked on a case last time I was here.
I gave you a theory. Just like I'd help a guy who needs a Heimlich in a restaurant. And then I shut the door behind you.,"But you'd knock over three other doctors to give it to him. Metaphorically speaking, you're a Heimlich addict."
"And you're an addiction addict. Right now your drug of choice is your old team, and like any addict you're trying to solve some other pRoblem and it's not gonna work. If you'll excuse me, I have a ""ï¿½",You have a tight schedule of nose jobs and tummy tucks.
"Yes. I do nose jobs. Just like the guy who came here after a car crash, Couldn't Even breathe through! his... Antibiotics wouldn't work if his sinuses were infected and clogged. If there was a pocket of bacteria his blood vessels couldn't reach. You surgically drain his sinuses, the drugs will work.",Nice. Tell me that didn't feel good. See you tomorrow.
"Actually, you can. I was the one who had the pRoblem. I don't anymore.",I owe you an apology. I was wr-rr-r... I was wrr-r-rr...
What were you wrong about?,You spent weeks elaborately concealing the fact that you... crashed daddy's car. And then you just confessed. Seemed idiotic. Certain to end in disaster. Instead you're riding off into the sunset together. Any theories on why?
"I assume you've already dismissed the ""she loves me"" theory?","Well, it's possible. It would require the presupposition that Everything she's done for the last six years has been completely inconsistent with her character, but yeah, it's possible."
"And as we've already established, it's also possible that you're wrong.","Or there's another explanation. Since you don't have one, I'm gonna keep looking for you."
It's not meningococcemia.,"No matter how much you finish each other's sentences, don't count on being a diagnostic package deal."
"Could've stopped him from producing clotting proteins, damaged his blood cells, causing small strokes.",Enough! Enough! Stop pummeling Thirteen and Taub. It fits. Prep the Patient for an ERCP. See if there's any hope of opening his blocked bile channels. And tell him to start looking for a liver donor. Dr. Chase. Your turn. So what'd she say?
She forgave me because I feel guilty.,That works too.
"And now you expect me to ask you what the ""too"" refers to.","Only if you're interested. Only if you have doubts about her answer. She thinks that you don't have anything to feel guilty about, because you didn't kill anybody. I did. She blames me for Dibala's murder, not you."
You were barely involved in that case. She knows that.,"But I created the big, bad, evil climate that allowed it to happen."
You're wrong.,Powerful counter-argument.
Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to screw things up?,"You got the tense wrong. Things are already screwed up. Which is why you don't just want to work for me, you need to. Cameron thinks you're my personal sock puppet. If you don't stay, it's gonna be hard to prove you're not. I have to go."
"You got the tense wrong. Things are already screwed up. Which is why you don't just want to work for me, you need to. Cameron thinks you're my personal sock puppet. If you don't stay, it's gonna be hard to prove you're not. I have to go.","Last week, my cane could only do ten minutes."
What are you doing here?,Waiting for you to take a nap so I can surge into the lead. What's the best way to restore the liver in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?
Not getting drawn into this.,You already are.
Because you crashed my workout?,"You're doing core training. Which improves balance, which staves off the most Debilitating symptoms of Huntington's. You've ended your self-destructive streak. Want to do something significant, something that'll last longer than the few years you have left. My team is your first-best choice."
And my first choice is the community health clinic I interviewed with yesterday.,"Absolutely, you should do that. Three hours a week. Every doctor should 'cause Every doctor can. But you don't want to be Every doctor. Plus, on my team, you get to screw with Foreman. Every way but literally."
Why are you doing it this way? You're pretending to assume we're all coming back without actually asking us. Why?,"See, this is why you'd be miserable wiping noses in a clinic."
You can't ask because you can't face the rejection. Why not? What's going on?,Are you asking me to ask you?
Which means it could be a hematological pRoblem plus cardiomyopathy.,"No, neck veins are flat, precordial exam was normal."
What if it's lymphoma? Peritoneal carcinomatosis explains the liver failure. Paraneoplastic syndrome explains Everything else.,Lymphoma it is. Prep him for chemo. Fax Taub and Thirteen the latest update on the case.
Seriously?,They have as much right to know as anyone on the team.
If that's how you feel... Okay.,"My strategy's not completely working. All four of them want to work for me, but all four of them have reasons why they don't want to work for me. How do I get them to take one from column A and none from column B? Right. Right, by not saying anything, you're saying that the answer is inside me."
The answer has nothing to do with the question.,Then it's not technically the answer.
Why do you need three of these doctors?,"Because I know they're good. Other doctors fall into the ""might be good"" Category."
"It has nothing to do with them being good. You think they're idiots half the time, but they're comfortable. You feel abandoned by Cuddy, so you're reaParkng out to people you know for comfort.","Oh, my God, you're right. I don't need doctors at all. I just need a good friend."
"Cuddy's right. Maybe, just maybe, if I don't play along, you'll realize you can't solve a deeper pRoblem with a surface solution.",Would've been more profound if you hadn't said anything.
"He's been off 'em since yesterday, anyway.","Long passes, wild guesses, anything."
"Hypopituitarism. Could cause multi-organ failure if ""ï¿½",If his thyroid hormone wasn't completely normal.
Renal cell carcinoma.,Renal ultrasound was clean.
"I'd say aleukemic leukemia. Marrow's not making enough normal cells ""ï¿½",Ablate the Patient's bone marrow. Find him a donor match.
Ablation could kill him or leave him defenseless against an infection that could.,"Well, then come up with something better. He may as well die while we're treating him. Okay with you if I bring the other candidates into the loop now?"
You're leaving at 11:00 a.m.?,"Trust me, the case is almost over."
"Foreman told me you're ablating the Patient's marrow, on a non-theory that Foreman himself withdrew. You're gonna kill the Patient. Is this about me and Lucas? I want alternatives for the Patient.",So do I.
I want to be on the team.,You think that's gonna save your marriage?
I don't know.,"Four candidates, three spots. I got a tough decision ahead of me."
Why are you here?,'Cause I think we're wrong. Which means something's gonna go wrong. Or right. Takayama here.
It's me and Thirteen. Stop the ablation.,Because?
"Once you killed them, it started killing him.",So his life of filth wasn't the pRoblem. Clean living was. Let's start him on methylprednisolone.
And some helminths.,"Worms. Cool, huh? Best out of three?"
I want to be on the team.,Good news for your wife.
"Thanks for the sarcasm. I reorganized my life to spend more time with her, but apparently I don't love her as much as I thought.",Or you love her more. This job gives you the thrill you used to find through philandering. Better to cheat with a beaker and an MRI than one of your platinum-blonde plastic surgery Patients. I'll let you know.
"I told House I want to work for him again. Stay on the team. You were always more into it than I was, more interested in diagnostics. Unless House was right about why you want out.",Four for four.
"I was in love with you. I was an idiot. Tried to be like you, tried to understand you because I thought I could heal you. You almost killed that Patient.","If almost not saving his life means ""ï¿½"
You knew the diagnosis a long time ago. You risked another Patient's life to bait your old team.,Another one?
You did kill Dibala. By playing God and teaParkng us to do the same.,I taught you to think for yourselves.
You don't Even think of them as people. They're just lab rats for your little puzzles.,"As you celebrate their huManity, I'd rather solve those little puzzles and save their lives."
Motives do matter. Lives can't come second.,The Patient is alive. That's what matters.
Not to you. All you care about is that Taub and Thirteen fell for your game. You'll poison them just like you poisoned Chase.,Your husband killed a Patient and you're breaking up with me.
You ruined him. So he can't Even see right from wrong. Can't Even see the sanctity of a huMan life anymore. I loved you. And I loved Chase. I'm sorry for you both. For what you've become. Because... there's no way back for either of you.,"Any idea where I can get a great, big ""Mission Accomplished"" banner? Got my sanity back, my license back, and now..."
You're kidding. All of them?,Three out of four. Which is almost as good as four out of five.
"Who was the ""ï¿½",Cameron.
"Wow. I can't beliEve it. I mean, really. I can't... beliEve it. You were right, House. Good for you.","Yeah, it is. She's broken up with Chase, and she's leaving the hospital. Still, three out of four ain't bad."
$2.32.,Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.
"I don't know who Dr. Wilson is, and we don't have tabs.",Do you know who I am?
No.,Good.
I got it. It's all right.,"Thanks. Although I should make it clear that for two bucks all you get is top half, over the clothes. Any plans for turkey day?"
Go to my sister's for dinner. Why?,Just making pleasant conversation. I've heard tell of folks doing such.
How 'bout we talk about this? 15-year-old. Recurring migraines and blurred vision.,Great.
Really?,Sure. There's no point in putting a band together if we're not gonna play any gigs.
Hold on. Take this instead. I was expecting more resistance.,That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free. Enjoy your drumstick.
That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free. Enjoy your drumstick.,"Ready to save some lives? 32-year-old courier. Ataxia, anemia, mild cough. CT was clear. Tox screen negative."
What're you so excited about?,"Why wouldn't I be? Got all my starters back, plus a couple of first-class free agents. I feel like Mike Tomlin. PRobably not as much as you do, but you get the idea."
Ataxia and anemia could be viral. Maybe West Nile?,"No fEver, lymph glands were normal. Anybody seen Wilson?"
Hyperbilirubinemia?,"Yeah, like that's a real thing."
Meningitis.,Anemia's a stretch. Page Dr. Wilson at 558.
Whites can get it.,Come on. We get the tennis elbow and all the money. Let them have sickle cell.
"He's right. What, you thought I wouldn't agree with him? Ever?","You didn't agree with him. That's why he dumped you. Oh, sorry. It was mutual."
"We're cool, okay? Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.",Sounds passionate.
"Not to me. What if he had a history of ""ï¿½","One big, happy family. TTP it is. Confirm with a blood smear and adamts13 antibodies."
SParkstocytes suggest TTP.,Good. Now what?
"Normally, we'd try plasmapheresis, but the Patient has an albumin colloid allergy.",So?
So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.,"Yes, it does."
"Yes, it does.",Wilson?
No.,Do you know where he is?
You're sure you want us to take out his spleen.,"Is that what a ""splenectomy"" is? I thought it was an ice cream treat. Yuck."
So you do really think he has TTP? You're not just testing us.,"Yeah, like I have time for games."
So why did you really take this case?,Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.
Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.,Missed you at breakfast this morning. And lunch.
I had a dentist appointment.,You know where Cuddy's sister lives?
You see. This is why I don't answer your urgent pages. Because they're not urgent pages.,I've decided what I'm gonna do about Cuddy and Lucas. I'm going to break them up.
Of course.,"It's given me a purpose in life, a goal, a raison d'Ãªtre."
"Albeit a selfish, mean-spirited, Parkldish raison.","Ehhhhh. I think of it more as benevolent. There's only two possible outcomes for their relationship. They split, or they stay together forEver. If it's split, then the sooner it happens the better for Everyone. If it's stay, then my meddling won't matter. In fact, if they survive it, it might Even make their bond stronger."
How you Manage to elevate your narcissism to beneficence is masterful.,"And I've decided to do it at Thanksgiving dinner. Just 'cause I'm sentimental. Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back ""ï¿½"
"House, don't.","I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash."
I have no idea where Cuddy's sister lives.,Ask and thou shalt receive.
You can't honestly think I would help you with this.,"Not help me, help Cuddy, remember? If you don't get it, I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods."
Blood flow's restored. There appears to be no perManent damage.,"Good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all."
Bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.,"Thank God he's still got his appendix and tonsils. So what looks like TTP, acts like TTP, tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?"
CT would've picked up something.,"Hi, I'm Greg House, a friend of your sister, Lisa."
Could be DIC.,Cuddy. Sorry. Wrong number.
I'm sure he's got a perfectly logical explanation.,Can't be DIC. No hemorrhaging. And I'm calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within a 100-mile radius.
WBC's normal.,"Hey, Julia. You're, uh ""ï¿½ you're Lisa's sister, right? You sure? 'Cause you are number 12."
Otis Campbell.,PRobably kept her first name.
Standard tox screen. Unstandard toxins don't show up on it.,"Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen; you two search his home. Otis Campbell's got to be hiding somewhere."
"Thank you, doctor, you've been wonderful.","As have you, Diana. Be well."
He's done six already.,Figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.
So which one of us slipped through the wormhole into an alternate dimension?,I have always loved to travel. And paint. Lucky number sEven.
"House... I know you're trying to be nice, but I also know you're doing it because you have an agenda.",Wow. Sexy and smart. Lucas is a lucky guy.
"The question is, is this a bad agenda or a good one? Either you're trying to screw with me, or you're trying to show me that you've really changed.",So which is it? I'm dying to know.
What are you doing for Thanksgiving dinner?,Peace in our time. It cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.
This is a three-hour drive. Have you considered the possibility that this is a fake address?,You think she'd send me to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?
If she's smart.,She is. That's why I ran it through motor vehicles. Good as gold.
This cannot end well.,I don't want it to end well. You should come as my date. You're not gonna want to miss this.
What's with the ties?,Makes me look adorably non-threatening. Party or party hearty ?
Liver failure would explain all the symptoms. Party.,"So guy's a brainiac, and his secret drug of choice is booze? That's kind of pedestrian, don't you think?"
With pedestrian alcoholism. Liver biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.,"Yes, assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Year's. On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today."
Why us?,Juniority. Welcome back.
What do you want us to do?,Same as me. Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
String beans?,Julia?
Nice. Except now we have to stay and test his kidneys.,Key under the mat.
There's no key under the mat.,"Oh, right. You need to replace one of your kitchen windows. I helped myself to your wine cellar. I'll leave a buck on the way out. You're not right for her."
And you are?,Less wrong.
Ah.,Then I started thinking... What was I saying?
"You were saying it's late, and...",She invited me. She didn't know if she should. She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or... if I'm still the same old S.O.B. I've always been. But she always gave me a chance. 832 chances. And I used up Every one of them. 832's her limit. Make a note.
"How 'bout a cup of coffee? It's just instant, but...",I'm pathetic. I don't deserve her.
"Okay, okay, all right. Uh, here. Maybe you should crash here. It's a sofa bed.",I love her.
What did you say to Lucas last night?,"I know there were a lot of consonants. I don't remember how I got here, nEver mind what I said."
"Well, I just talked to him. And he said he thought it'd be better if we stopped seeing each other. Said he didn't realize how much there still was between you and me, and he didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.","I was drunk. WhatEver I said, he can't really ""ï¿½"
"I've had enough, House. I actually felt bad about scamming you. But then you lived down to my expectations and then some. There is no ""us."" There nEver will be.",It worked.
Please tell me you're talking about a medical procedure.,They split up this morning. You're the very first one I've told.
And you think she'll start dating you? I'm sure she hates you.,"But her eyes say, ""How will I Ever pay you for that tennis lesson?"""
"Ah, what a shame.",They'll get over it.
I meant for you.,"I'll get over it faster than they do. Can't beliEve that Lucas fell for my ""I nEver say this because it's so personal except that I'm drunk"" profession of love. Second-oldest trick in the book."
You're right. It's his fault because he's stupid.,He certainly is.
He certainly is.,You're stupid.
"Well, I'm rubber, and you're glue.","He's not pedestrian, he's stupid. At least stupider than he should be. He's a DXM junkie."
Dextromethorphan. As in cough syrup?,"He wasn't taking it for his cough. It's cheap, available at your corner drug store, and taken in high doses, it's a dumb drug."
"Dumb drug. Well, he obviously hasn't ""ï¿½","He's smart compared to you. He's a moron compared to what he was. ""Robotripping."" Lowers the IQ. It also causes brain damage. Unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol. About one drink per day. He wasn't abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally. He was abusing the cough meds, and taking the booze medicinally. Bravo."
You do.,"Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms. Even ""ï¿½ oh, sweet irony ""ï¿½ your cough. Whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal. We get all traces of it out of your system. You'll be the unhappiest little courier in no time."
I don't think I can live without it.,You'd be surprised what you can live without. Make him a genius.
"No. That's the pRoblem. I'm the one who's a jerk. But I owe her Everything. I want to want to be with her. And when I'm clear, I... I can't.","Fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath?"
Sometimes. Is the wait always this long?,"Only on days that end in ""day."" Diarrhea, weight loss?"
A bit. Don't you Ever shave?,"Yeah. once a week. How 'bout you? Stomach pain, tenderness?"
Every now and then. Are you this rude to all your Patients?,"Oh, yes! Don't think you're special. So we've got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms. Yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal."
What do you think I have?,"I'm not sure, but I think it's... a lame job."
What?,You're a rat. Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.
That's ridiculous.,"Is it really? 'Cause you seem a lot more interested in asking questions than answering them. Handwriting on your medical records is obviously not a doctor's 'cause I can almost read it. And when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse. Found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize before you came to the clinic. I was looking for gum."
You're an ass.,Put it in your report. I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not when we leave this room.
Put it in your report. I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not when we leave this room.,"Remember, first ice, then heat. If you have any pRoblems, don't hesitate to call me."
"Thank you, Dr. House.",Wait a second. Where's Cuddy?
Gone for the day.,"Hey, hey, hey! Sorry. I can't remember if I've mocked you yet for being a male nurse."
I think this counts.,Fair enough.
"Vitamin B12 deficiency? Gives us anemia, numbness.",Not a stroke.
"If he has a vascular malformation ""ï¿½ Anemia's not macrocytic.",Sorry to inconvenience you. Dying Patients can be so thoughtless.
Don't.,"Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde? Come on, people."
Bone marrow malignancy.,Wouldn't produce sParkstocytes.
Lupus.,"Gee, thanks for coming in. ANA was negative. What about you? Got any predictable drivel you'd like to add?"
I think they've given you enough already.,"Well, at least they're trying. They're not just sitting there like roadkill. Give me something. Give me something, or I'll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her."
You're gonna be pressing charges?,Against the ottoMan I tripped over?
Against Chase.,I'm pretty sure the ottoMan was acting alone. You free for dinner this weekend?
At least three other people saw him do it.,Mass hysteria. Either night?
I can't have doctors punParkng each other out.,"Oh, my God, who got punched?"
"And more importantly, for Chase's sake, I need to know if he's able to handle himself or if I should be getting him some help.","Chase couldn't have punched anyone. He was with me when I tripped over the ottoMan. If you're not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?"
"I'm not doing this, House. It's not fun anymore. Just do your job.",I need your help.
What happened to your face?,"I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang. You're a computer. I'm gonna feed you data, and you analyze it."
"What, are you gonna feed me 20 years of medical knowledge too? It's not gonna work.",I know. But I don't have anyone else to ask.
"It's lonely, isn't it?",It's not that bad.
Then you're not that smart. You Ever tried to kill yourself?,Not quickly.
"I did. 12 years ago I jumped off the top of my eight-story building into a dumpster bin the day before pickup. I broke my collarbone, my leg, and three ribs. When I was in the hospital they put me on narcotics and suddenly Everything was just better. I didn't feel isolated or lonely. That's where I met my wife. She was so happy. And dumb. And I was... smart... and miserable. You tell me who the genius is. I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head, and I knew I wanted to stay that way forEver.",Enjoy.
Easier on your conscience if I die an idiot?,What's a conscience? Which ribs... did you break in the fall? They on the left side?
Ferrous oxide contrast?,"Gets absorbed by the spleen. Unless he doesn't have one. In which case it's absorbed by the liver, and fries that."
You think I opened him up and didn't take out his spleen?,"All organs do look kind of the same ""ï¿½ red and squishy."
"Okay, that is amazing.","12 years, eight stories, and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen. Bits of it split off, circulated through his bloodstream until they landed and attached somewhere else."
So it is TTP. I just didn't remove... all of his spleens.,16 splenectomies. Pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.
"I can outrun you. Sorry about the nose. And the eye. And the, uh... eyebrow.",Guess I deserved it.
"Well, if I thought that, I wouldn't be apologizing.",Your fist slipped?
"Everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.",So you busted my nose to keep people off your back.
Pretty much.,Making people Even more worried about you.
Maybe. But at least they're not talking to me about it.,Fair enough.
Thank you.,Don't be so grateful. You'll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.
"Well, uh, thanks for our talk. It's been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.",So what're you gonna do?
"Well, she doesn't have to know. It's worked for 12 years.",Tell your brain I said good-bye.
"Einstein is giving himself a lobotomy, and you're cool with that?",Ignorance is bliss.
Wow.,Dr. Cuddy. Can we at least be civil?
How's your nose?,It's okay. Does your kid like animals? I got tickets to that holiday carnival. I hear they have a nice petting zoo.
I think I was pretty clear before.,I don't mean with me. Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.
"No, thanks.","They're not fake. I didn't steal them. One of the nurses was selling 'em for her kid's scout trip. I know it doesn't make things right between us, but I just wanted to do something nice."
I don't want them.,Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.,They didn't split up. She wouldn't take the tickets.
"Of course. Windtalker code for ""we nEver split up."" House, she told you multiple times she wants nothing to do with you.","I wasn't gonna be there. She just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them."
Either that or she didn't want to appease you.,"These weren't reparations. Just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down. They didn't break up. She just wanted me to think that so I'd back off."
Dare I ask what you're gonna do?,Nothing. I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together. They didn't break up.
And you're okay with that?,It is what it is.
Good for you.,Aah.
Oh. How the...,"Well, I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body, I know not Everybody has got a body like you. Baaby."
"You know, most people go for the hardwood or carpeting. I think guitars and garbage work just as well.",Got the urge to play last night. Had to go all the way back to my apartment. Thought I'd save on future trips.
Hmm. That's very eco-friendly of you. How about keeping down on the noise pollution?,6:33. You should be flossing by now.
Ah. Ah.,Is it that time of year again? He's a self-important jerk.
He's my friend.,He's a self-important jerk.
Seems to be what I'm attracted to.,Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't Even know your name.
I just had a House moment. Diagnosed Transverse Myelitis from a cold sore. How cool is that? Patients really eat that crap up.,It's why I'm loved. What am I doing here?
Ultrasound is clear.,"Which means he's definitely not pregnant, right?"
"I'm joining you, Antonio Aguilar. We'll play in God's MariaPark band.",Draw some blood. The self-important jerk does not have Transverse Myelitis. He's got cancer.
How do you Even--,"Okay. Maybe I paid the redhead down in records a few bucks to CC me on all your cases. A few Patients die, you might get sad again. Make a speech that would end your career. Frankly, I'm stalking you for you. How long does a simple blood draw take?"
Almost finished.,"Well, when you're finished almost finishing it, test it."
Confusion. Delirium.,Why rule out the hand of God so fast?
Why rule out the hand of God so fast?,Your guy's low white count and right arm paralysis equals a recurrence of his leukemia. Simple math.
Did you look past the first page of the file? No AML cells anywhere. I did the blood smears myself.,It's still cancer. You know how I know? He's got an oncologist for a doctor.
And your magical leukemia detector is more powerful than a flow cytometer?,"I look for zebras because other doctors rule out all the horses. In this case, you are those other doctors. You haven't earned a zebra. 100 bucks."
Are you serious?,"Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your pRoblem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor."
"Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your pRoblem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.",Just give me the lactic acid lEvel.
27,"The fact that you can't speak English is not an excuse for you not being humiliated by what I'm about to say. It's also not an excuse for you not telling us that you were a tennis pro. If you had, we wouldn't have wasted our time."
"Thanks, Doc.",Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?
Nice hiding spot.,"Actually, it's perfect. It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you. What did she want?"
She was checking up on Tucker thanks to you.,That's it?
Like what? Something about you? Something you could interpret as being about you? An anagram maybe? It'd be great if you could play hide and seek somewhere else. My Patient--,No pRoblem. Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.
Tucker doesn't have cancer.,"He doesn't have a ball of fungus in his lungs either. Next time you want to use my team, I suggest you at least leave a tip."
There's nothing to talk about.,Why are you doing surgery when I need you finding me a new case?
You don't want a new case.,"Oh, right. Guess I'm here for Wilson. Obviously you didn't tell me that Cuddy was moving in with Lucas 'cause you were protecting me. Which is odd since I told you that I'm fine with their relationship. So obviously, you question one of those assumptions or you have an issue with logic."
"Yes, you're fine with them dating. But moving in together is a whole other lEvel of commitment.","This is the 21st century, Wilson. I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship could one day lead to fornication. Although, the fact that she wants to buy a loft, could actually mean that their relationship is not as serious as I thought."
"Oh, for God's sake, House, don't do this to yourself. It's a loft. It has no deeper meaning than open-space living arrangement.",If you bought into her diatribe about rediscovering her lost city girl roots. And two bedrooms. It just reeks of commitment issues.
Yeah. Or she has a baby.,This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis. This is her version of a two-seat convertible.
"Wilson, he's got global lung damage. Means it's not fungal. It's PCP pneumonia.","Hmm. Obviously something is knocking out his immune system. Three options. HIV, acquired SCID, or my personal favorite, cancer. I'm sure you'll test for all three."
Thanks. The treatment indiCate--,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of something."
"It's a conference room, with glass walls. You thought I'd be alone?",Your Patient has cancer. Not that guy. Who pRobably also has cancer. And he's pRobably also your buddy. Thought you'd want to know. And you owe me 100 bucks.
Coming through. House got a new case.,"Revised OR schedule. Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you. It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes."
"House, your guy's not bleeding out of his eyes either.",The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.
Your case is no more urgent than mine.,"Yeah, but you're way more Patient."
Maybe not.,We just removed a screw from a guy's lung. And the weird thing is he didn't get better. Any idea what that means?
It means you're not listening to me.,No. It means I'm ignoring you to make a point. There is a difference.
The pRoblem with that technique is I have no idea what point you're making.,"That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to. Doubling your Patient's chemo dose is stupid. Damn, now it's explicit."
It could swamp out the resistance of the cancer cells.,The fact that it theoretically should work doesn't make it any less stupid.
Of course it does. It's exactly what you would do.,I'm me. You're you.
And a table is a table.,"And chemo is poison. And double chemo is double poison. And I can handle it when things go wrong. You can't. And things could go very,"
"Either way, he's dead. We can't stop the oozing.",Don't care. I'm here because it's 1:15 and Wilson started testing at 12:45. Which means...
He needs a new liver.,Look on the bright side. You can publish the results of this case study. No one will Ever double the dose again.
"I'm sorry, Mel. You and Emily don't match Tuck's blood type. And neither does Ashley. So a live liver donation is out. The best thing to do is just what you've been doing. Be together.",Hope he already told you that you're gonna die. 'Cause it's gonna make what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.
"House, I know it's raining out there in the hallway, butï¿½","I was just in the ER, testing my Patient for autonomic dysfunction. It's the only department with a shower big enough for the whole team, plus the cardiac monitors, plus me. Anyway, relevant part, we're just wheeling the guy out, trauma came in. Motorcycle versus semi."
How bad?,Bad for the motorcycle. Good for your liver. Blood type's a match.
Why wasn't I paged?,Because there's a pRoblem. No organ donor card. Dead guy's sister
Where is she?,20 minutes away.
"How do you get the call that your brother's dead and then run out the door? ""Oh--oh--oh, that reminds me, I-I had dry cleaning to pick up.""",Did Cuddy buy the place?
Not yet. You okay?,Just making conversation. Yours was getting boring.
What are you planning?,I'm not planning anything.
And I don't beliEve you. How are you gonna punish her for dating Lucas?,"Okay, now this conversation is getting boring."
Are you really okay?,No! I am not okay. Not Even close.
"Wow. Okay. See, that's very adult of you.","No, it isn't. It's just me accepting the fact that there's nothing I can do and moving on."
"Which is, I think, the definition of adulthood.","Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun."
"Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.",Showtime.
It will save my Patient's life.,What if I told you that he wasn't dead?
Are you saying my brother is still alive?,I'm saying you're being an idiot. But I don't have time to talk you out of your religion so I'm stuck with giving you a technicality that will let you justify
House.,The last generous act of a living person.
"House, it's too late. The liver's started to degrade. It's no longer viable for transplant.",Well played. Religion just killed another person.
"Tucker, it's... I can't.",Late night with the Pigeon sisters?
"""I'll nEver betray the secret of the bushido of the heel""ï¿½]",Someone's cranky. And late. Where were you?
getting a drink. What--why are all my frozen dinners thawing on the counter?,I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.
I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.,Why'd you go out drinking alone when you got such great company here?
Tucker wants me to donate a lobe of my liver to him.,And you were out drinking. So you're actually considering this?
Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.,"Your mouth says no, but your pathetic attempt at a deflection has guilt written all over it."
It's my fault. It is my fault! I gave him too much chemo.,You cured his cancer.
And killed him in the process.,Quibbles.
Quibbles.,He's had a predictable complication. Surprise. Bad things happen to people who are sick. Doesn't make you responsible.
"Oh, no--not legally. Ethically. Ethically!","A table is a table. Don't be a doormat, Wilson."
Call me a doormat-- get it all out of your system-- but I'm doing it.,Why?
He's my friend.,I'm your friend. All the pain pills I've taken. What if I need your liver?
Right. How selfish of me not to have considered your possible future needs.,They're all dying. They're all your friends.
"I'm not here for an argument, House.","No, right, that's room 12A. So why are you here? Want to make sure that I've called the moving van?"
"No. The operation is in two hours, and I'd like you to be there with me.",No.
What-- why?,"Because if you die, I'm alone."
"Actually, it's James.",You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?
I still feel good about what I did.,You don't feel angry?
Ah. I'm a little disappointed.,Disappointment is anger for wimps. You don't have to be so gentle about Everything. It's okay to get angry once in a while.
You can't change a table.,"Actually, you can. Just need a coat of paint and the guts to use it."
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.,You're gonna outbid her?
We do need a bigger refrigerator. She hurt my friend. She should be punished.,You got mad. I'm proud of you. Cuddy won't share that sentiment. How are you gonna explain it to her?
I'm changing our address to a P.O. box.,She'll find out Eventually.
Bonnie. I'll take it.,Baby steps.
We almost done here?,"Assuming you did this shaving your forehead... Okay, then. I'm ordering a head C.T."
You gotta stay here. We'll straighten out that mess with Marco tomorrow. Let the doc do his job.,"Actually, stitParkng you up is really the E.R. doc's job."
Yeah. Too long of a wait.,"Yeah. Also, a lot of cops in the E.R. Not that you care about that. So how did this happen? Yeah, you're right. That was a stupid question. 'Cause the answer's kind of obvious. No scrapes on your hands means you didn't try to break your fall. Means either out cold or totally disoriented when you went down. No sign of trauma other than the cut means no one hit you in the head. Powder burn on your jacket sleEve means someone shot a gun."
"All right, Eddie. Come on, let's go.","I don't care what you guys are into. If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again."
Whoa. What will?,This. Cool.
This. Cool.,"32-year-old Man, recent dEveloped loud-noise-induced vertigo. C.T. was clean. No internal bleeding, no edema. Everything else is in the file. Cameron get your hair in the divorce?"
This guy strained his back three years ago. And that's it. All the rest of these pages are blank.,"Yes, he won't tell us anything. Understandable, since he's a drug dealer."
He actually said he was a drug dealer?,"Not out loud. But he was wearing a solid gold Patek Philippe. His friend had a Rolex. But their phones were prepaid burners, so they can toss 'em as soon as they're done."
"It doesn't matter if this guy's a drug dealer or not. Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain. Head C.T. was clean, so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma. We need to do an A.B.R. to test his hearing.","Acoustic neuroma fits. So does lidocaine toxicity. Or benzocaine ""ï¿½ depends what he's cutting the coke with."
"So now he's not just a drug dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.",He seemed peppy. You test his ears. I'm gonna go test his cocaine.
You think this guy's just gonna hand over a briefcase full of illegal drugs because you ask nicely?,I hope not.
"I make that much money. And... apparently, you don't.",I need the drugs.
We're in textiles.,I need the drugs! Hmm... works for Jack Bauer.
Is this really necessary? The chairs in the hall are way more comfortable.,"But way less genre-appropriate. Okay, here's the deal. I need information. You have reasons not to give me that information. So either I can force it out of you... or I can't."
I wish I could tell ya.,"Okay... Well, let's work with that. Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles. What's your major product? Is it ""h""? And by that I mean ""hosiery."""
We do more with... culottes.,"Is that with a ""c"" or a ""k""?"
"""C."" Nobody wants ""k"" anymore.",Does your friend cut the fabric?
"No, he's a sales guy.","Well, he must cut a culotte here and there."
I'm sorry. Can I talk to you for a second?,I'm interrogating a suspect. Make it quick.
Everyone in our building thinks we're gay.,We're grown men over the age of 30 who moved in together. We're two tigers away from an act in Vegas. They'll figure out we're straight Eventually.
Any chance I could get some water over here?,"If only there was some way to communiCate that information to her. Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds. If only the larynx was capable of ""ï¿½"
She didn't beliEve me. She sidestepped my dinner invite.,And a Woman would only reject you because she's worried that you might not be interested in her.
"We were chatting, having fun. There was definitely a sPark.","When she thought you were gay. You sure your friend isn't secretly tr ""ï¿½ What is a culotte, anyway?"
Mickey hates the stuff. He's one of the few guys I trust to watch the product overnight. They took him away an hour ago. You think he's okay?,It's an ear test. Pretty sure he'll live.
Which means we can stop the bloodhound gang routine and go back to being doctors.,But we're doctors all the time. It's so boring. Fine.
"Thought I'd give myself a little treat. What if it's not his brain, but it's on the way to his brain? Carotid stenosis.",Get an ultrasound of his carotids. See if his arteries are clogged.
You bugged his room?,"Our Patient sleeps in the building where they keep their stash. Eventually, he'll say something that gives away where that is. And we'll find out what's making him sick."
But we ruled out environmental causes.,You ruled out environmental causes.
"And you pretended to agree, just so we'd take him out of his room so you could plant the bug.",Carotid stenosis was a decent idea. But an Even decent-er idea is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells. Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.
Bug's a better idea than blindly running tests for days.,Tell him it'll take weeks. It'll be faster.
Shut up.,"3-B? You're Nora, right? My roommate tells me you're the one to thank for all the tips about the neighborhood. Greg."
Nice to meet you.,"I hear you thought that Wilson and I liked to polish each other's swords. And by swords, I mean pistols."
Of course he told you about that.,"Oh, don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised that doesn't happen more often. We're both straight. Oh, my... God, that is beautiful. We finally have the room to display it the way it deserves. Would you ""ï¿½ would you help me get this upstairs?"
Absolutely.,"Nice shoes, by the way. Louboutin?"
"Patient went out, came back worse than before. Points us back to environmental, tied to wherEver he went.","No, it doesn't. Where's Foreman?"
"What do you mean, ""No, it doesn't""? We screwed up the tail. My car was impounded.","True, amusing, and irrelevant. Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?"
"Uh, yeah.",Mazel tov. Should be fun to watch.
You're off environmental?,"WherEver he went, it wasn't for long enough. Add in the fEver and infection's way more likely. And if it is an infection, his symptoms suggest it's moved to his brain. Which means..."
I ran into Nora this morning. She told me about your Evita listening party.,The London and New York recordings are so different.
You were supposed to tell her that we're straight.,"She didn't beliEve me, either."
You're doing this to mess with me.,"Correction ""ï¿½ I started doing this to mess with you. Now I'm honestly trying to hit that."
By pretending you're gay and in a relationship with me?,"We're in a relationship and we're really unhappy. Communication's nEver been easy for us. PRobably 'cause we're so closeted. I got it all figured out. Nora and I spend the next few weeks hanging out, become best girlfriends. I confide in her about our issues."
I can't decide if this plan is more despicable or illogical.,"Then, one night, we get drunk... back rub turns into a front rub... The next morning, ""I've nEver felt this way about a Woman before."""
That's... quite a commitment you've made to jumping the girl I'd like to date.,I'd like to date her. In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.
I saw her first.,Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?
We're guys. It's a code.,You're only bringing this up 'cause you know you're gonna lose.
"It's not an infection, but it might be an autonomic nerve disorder.","The hair is still bumping me. Did you get it cut because you're ready for the next chapter or ""ï¿½"
We stuck a needle into his spinal bodies twice. His heart rate stayed normal. If we add that to his other symptoms...,That would be a mistake.
She's nEver gonna fall for it.,"Well, then, you got nothing to worry about, sweetie."
"Well, then, you got nothing to worry about, sweetie.",You're a wuss.
Say that when I'm better.,"What, are you gonna beat me up? That sounds stressful. Maybe you should pop one of your beta blockers first."
You have a heart pRoblem?,"Medically, no. He would have told us about that. Metaphorically..."
"It's an effect from operating outside of the law. Sometimes, I have to do bad things. And not always to bad people. Last few months, that hasn't been so easy. A guy got me the pills. And they control the stress. Look, don't ""ï¿½ don't say anything to Eddie. All right? The last thing I need is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.",When was your last pill before we originally admitted you?
"Um, the night before.","And we stuck you in here, and you went into beta blocker withdrawal. That's what caused the hypertension. When he got out of here, he took another pill, and the hypertension went away. Which means it was nEver a symptom. We take that off the table, we've got vertigo, fEver..."
!and stress. He's been in this game for a while. Either he grew a conscience over the last few months or he's producing excess adrenaline.,Pheochromocytoma.
What?,"It's Greek for, ""You'll be back doing bad things to good people in no time."" M.R.I. his adrenal glands. You're okay with that, right? You're not gonna put a pillow over his face?"
"Hi, James. We've got some kung pao left. Oh! God. Right there. Oh. Oh.",We're having a picnic... with wine.
I'll pour you a glass.,He doesn't drink.
And environmental is back at the top of our list of suspects. We're trying to narrow down the possibilities.,That receiver doesn't respond to Manual stimulation. Maybe if you took off your shirt.
"Most buildings there were built between 1920 and 1940. We're compiling a list of toxins most common ""ï¿½",There's got to be at least one open frequency.
There's got to be at least one open frequency.,I need a few minutes with your friend. Or stay if you want. Rectal exam.
I'll check out the cafeteria.,Why the beta blockers?
What do you mean?,Valium and Xanax actually reduce stress. Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.
Whoa.,"Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking, and all those stage fright issues. That's why some people take them when they perform."
What the hell is that?,This is my bug. And this...
Um...,This... This is yours.
You bugged your own room? Are you... an inforMant?,An inforMant would have sold his pals out to us at the first sign of a sniffle. This guy... is a cop.
I don't see how this is relevant.,"In the land of no fun, you got a really sensible piece of property."
Give him a break. Knowing this guy's an undercover cop doesn't get us any closer to curing him.,Good point. You know what they say. Information is not power. Wait...
You're saying we should use the cop thing to force him to talk?,Force? I'm talking about the Womanly art of persuasion. I said Womanly.
"Any more clots keep forming, he may not last 24 hours.",And the moron still won't talk.
"Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?",Pretty much.
Guy's a hero. He's risking his life to put these dealers in jail.,I'm sure the dealers who take their places will be very grateful.
Except that treating for Everything could kill him faster than whatEver's killing him.,Got a better idea?
"Yeah, private party, Man. Uh... I got it covered tonight. Nice.",The jealousy is... killing me.
Well... he clearly cares about you. Very much.,"Why can't he show it in a ""ï¿½ in a normal way? I'm so tired of... the whole silence and the resentment. I don't know if I can go back there tonight. I need some time."
Come stay at my place.,Really?
"Mm-hmm. It'll be fun. You know, like a ""ï¿½ like a sleepover.","That would ""ï¿½ that would be... It would be such a help. Thank you."
House.,What are you doing here?
I'm here because...,Nothing you can say is going to change anything.
I love this Man. And I am not wasting another moment of my life denying that. Gregory House... will you marry me?,Wow. This is unexpected.
I'm gonna go.,"No ""ï¿½ no, no, no."
"I didn't see any fungus at the location, and none of the samples ""ï¿½",Looks like somebody missed something. Which is embarrassing for somebody.
"And... the steroids we gave him would have suppressed his immune system. If that was a fungus, he'd have 30 aneurysms.",Somebody's got a good point.
We need to start him on antifungal meds before he drowns in his own blood.,Do it.
Want to grab some coffee?,Kind of a bad time.
"Sorry. Uh, you told me to drop by, so... This is when I could make it.","Right. This whole thing with Wilson... It's all my fault. We're not closeted, because we're not gay. For real. Wilson thought you were cute, and I was just yanking his chain. Maybe that's not the best phrasing."
So you were only spending time with me to screw with him?,"God, no. I was spending time with you because I want to touch your boobs. Enough to listen to Evita, twice. And I really hate Evita. That's how much I like your boobs. Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Wilson... he's a really good guy. And he really likes you."
"Well, it's really... It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that. And you're still trying to sleep with me. You know, maybe I will call him. It would serve you right.",Wilson's a jerk too.
"Well, at least he tried to do the right thing.","He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying Patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then..."
"He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying Patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then...","The aneurysms look mycotic, but they're not. They're inflammatory. Because this is not a fungal infection. The hypertension was a real symptom. You've been unwittingly treating it with beta blockers. You stopped taking them, and your blood pressure went up. It's Hughes-Stovin."
Are you sure?,"If you die in the next day or so, I will be."
I'm sorry about your Patient.,He died a hero in his own mind. Guess it's better than nothing.
Ran into Nora in the elevator. She no longer thinks we're gay. Now she thinks we're mendacious dirt bags.,Mendacious dirt bag comes much more naturally to me. Least we can get rid of that.
I kind of like it. Unlike this sofa.,It's 500 bucks. And... it reclines.
"I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.",No chance.
"27 year old female intense, intermittent ear pains, saw six doctors!",Tell her to stop lurking in the front row. If she wants to hit on musicians that's what tour buses are for. Next.
If I ask why were in Wilson's office is there any chance I'll get a straight answer?,Try it. Try it.
"14-year-old boy, joint pain and excess hair growth.","Tell him to masturbate, no more than 3 times daily. With meals. Next."
Did I mention that the 27-year-old female is really hot. And her husband is really not!,"Wild guess, he's rich."
Not unless social workers have begun pulling in the big money recently.,Gimme...
You're taking the case because she's hot?,"No, that would be an accident of genetics. It's because she's hot and her husband is ugly. It's a fascinating window into the mysteries of huMan psychology. Also, she's really hot."
"Or... She, you know, loves her husband.",She loves something about him.
"To a healthier diet, raw foods, lots of nuts.","It's not the ear, it's the heart. Her protein is cheese, which can raise cholesterol. Hers was already elevated. Gave her arterial blockages."
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.,"So, beauty and the beast. Who wants to go see?"
You can't sleep in your own office? Or bedroom for that matter?,Got to avoid my natural habitat. Some idiot I went to med school with keeps leaving messages and wants to drop by for lunch.
So tell him no.,It's compliCated.
"It's too compliCated for you to tell someone you don't like, to screw off? That's practically your hobby.",A few months ago he was... sort of part of my therapy. My shrink told me to write a letter of apology to someone I hurt.
And how did you hurt him?,We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics. I switched my final paper with his.
You plagiarized? Doesn't sound like you.,"I was testing a theory. I thought that our professor was biased against me. I assumed he'd get a high grade with my paper and I'd get a low grade with his. Interestingly, I was wrong. I got an ""A.""ï¿½"
"So you're in this mental hospital, delving into your subconscious, and this is who you choose to apologize to?",Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.
Of all the people in the world you've hurt?,Not Everyone has a name that's so easy to find in the white pages.
"Um... I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.","Yeah. And yet, I picked him. It's funny, isn't it?"
"Yes, it's hilarious. Great to see what a success your therapy was.",We said we'd nEver go to sleep angry.
Where are you?,Undisclosed location.
Who are you hiding from?,"Wilson. And the lunch date that Wilson is, no doubt, right now trying to sic on me. But in the great game of chess that is our relationship, Wilson sees only one move ahead. I see dozens. That is why he will nEver mate me. That's a chess term."
That's great. A co-worker confronted our Patient. Altered mental status. Basically accused her of poisoning him. We think he was projecting.,So he's poisoning her.
What could he get his hands on to cause supraventricular tachycardia?,"Does he have dry skin? Thin eyebrows? If you're sharing an amazed look, please do it louder."
He might have. How did you know that?,"If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee, that would make her heart go boom. In a bad way."
"Because she's a successful, happily married consultant, and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo who we just tossed out of the hospital.",And she's hot.
You don't think it's suspicious she didn't Even mention it to her husband?,"Yeah, Foreman. Why did you break up with Thirteen? Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing she was saying, why that?"
"This is about the case, not some imaginary issue that you think Foreman and I have.","Great, start her on beta blockers."
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly. Dr. Wilson said you'd be here. How ya been?,"Check, and mate."
"Look... I'm sorry this is awkward or whatEver. I just thought it was nice of you to write that letter, and I wanted to tell you that you don't have to feel bad.",Thanks. So where are you working these days? You got your own practice or you at a hospital?
"I thought you knew. Dani's, the organic supermarket chain.",As an in House doctor?
"I actually nEver got licensed. I didn't graduate med school. I planned on going back, and then my father got sick and I had to take care of him and had some bad luck.",Why didn't you graduate?
I was one credit short. And I was sort of already on academic pRobation. So...,Which credit?
"I got a, uh... He failed me on that paper you switched. I thought you knew.",So I'm guessing you're the CEO of this supermarket chain?
Why do you want to meet her so badly?,Psychopaths always fascinate me. I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values. Or is that Jews?
We're not gonna be able to get an honest read on her unless we figure out a way to get the husband out of there.,"Hmm. I got an idea. Can you get out of here? Thanks. It was the ""thanks"" that did it."
"Hmm. I got an idea. Can you get out of here? Thanks. It was the ""thanks"" that did it.","Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long have you been a psychopath?"
Are you saying I'm like Ted Bundy or something?,"Psychopathy can get a bad rap. It doesn't necessarily mean you're violent. Just that you're completely without conscience, you lack any normal emotion, you Manipulate Everyone around you, you're promiscuous, you lie pathologically. Any of this ringing bells?"
Is that why you were asking me all those weird questions?,"Yeah ""ï¿½ though you have Darwin to thank for that. She got the creeps around you. Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths. PRobably an evolved response to predators."
"I'm sorry, you're really freaking me out. I have no idea what ""ï¿½",Relax. We have a duty of confidentiality. And you have an undiagnosed heart pRoblem that could kill you at any moment. We beliEve that your mental abnormality is related to your physical one. So if you want to keep on predating...
No. I gave him a little valium and an emetic.,"You sure you understand what the word ""no"" means?"
Same thing you get out of your job. Bill has a trust fund. And I have a prenup his parents made me sign.,Told you he was rich. She's not that weird.
She kind of reminds me of someone I know.,Tell me about it. Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces. How long have you been this way?
Just how I am. Are you gonna cure my heart pRoblems now?,So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia. Go.
I thought you were bluffing to get information. You really think they're connected?,"Two rare conditions in one Patient, it's a fair assumption they are."
Psychopathy is generally just genetic. Nothing you can do about it. Something that hits 30 years after birth isn't gonna be connected.,Her disease isn't gonna lie dorMant that long. Did her heart warp her brain?
Maybe a handful of diseases.,It'll be super awesome when we find it.
Tertiary syphilis can cause pseudopsychopathic syndrome and cardiomyopathy.,"Fits best. Start her on penicillin, and rule out Wilson's and Hashimoto's. There's your handful. Wasn't so hard, was it?"
You've gotta do something about Thirteen. She flouted both my authority and yours.,"Yes, and she got it right and you got it wrong."
Which just aggravates the pRoblem. She'll do it again. Next time it won't work out so well. You gotta punish her.,"You're her boss. In some vague, nEver to be usefully defined way. You punish her."
"I'm also her ex, which, as you know, makes it a little compliCated.",The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little compliCated to a little moronic.
"It was the only way I could ""ï¿½","It wasn't because you were too in love with her. It was because you were too in love with your career. We're almost at my floor so I'll summarize. Your pRoblem, not mine."
You cut up my only copy of that photo.,That rare daguerreotype. You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.
Not the one of me and Lucas. The one from Ecuador.,Right. I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.
To my dad.,You got his tail?
He was holding the camera. That was the last trip we Ever took together. And I don't have a digital copy.,"Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work."
"Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work.",You ignoring my texts?
Ãl es un doctor de mediciÃ³n,Tambiï¿½n de la medicina Doctor Wilson me llamÃ³ a una consulta
Tambiï¿½n de la medicina Doctor Wilson me llamÃ³ a una consulta,Wibberly's got some agenda. PRobably trying to guilt me into getting him a better job.
How pissed was he?,Not at all. That's how I know he's got an agenda.
Me duele mucho,Entonces no te lo hubieras golpeado
"If you feel guilty, you should do something to help. You are responsible.",No te preocupes. El Dr. Wilson es un muy buen mï¿½dico.
Thanks.,Quiï¿½n tiene una enorme consideraciÃ³n por los pacientes por su propia batalla fatal con impotencia.
What?,"All I'm responsible for is the foreseeable consequences of switParkng papers. A bad grade or a sleepless night, worst case, a retest. There was no way to know that one seminar paper was gonna destroy this idiot's life."
"If there's any karma in all this, he's pRobably happier than you are.","Good point. If he's happier, there's no harm done. I'll go find out."
That is absolutely not what I said.,"Always with the modesty, this one."
"Always with the modesty, this one.","La siguiente vez que tu quieras drogarte secretamente y confundir tu dedo con un clavo, las gotas para los ojos son buen remedio, pero usa menos por eso es que estas llorando demasiado."
You want something to eat?,I'm cool. How's work? You happy with it?
You know... It's a job. I don't need to take any work home with me at least.,Free time... Wouldn't have any of that if you were a doctor.
Yeah. True. You like Parkli? I could reheat some.,Is that your yard? That's nice.
"Yeah. That sugar maple, 100 - 150 years old. Most beautiful leaves in the fall. Sitting underneath on the bench ""ï¿½ It's like paradise.","I don't have a yard, myself. You got a good thing going."
I know.,So what are the boxes for?
I'm moving.,From paradise?
"Well, my dad's medical bills and me being one of those idiots that got an adjustable mortgage. So!",You're losing your home.
"Hey, it could be worse, right?",How?
I don't know what happened.,"Neither do I, but I know what happened after. She called Cuddy and deManded that I kick you off the case. I backed you up, because I trust you. But you're gonna have to earn that trust now."
"Actually, he backed you up because of the new B.U.N. creatinine numbers. Brittle bones were from kidney failure.","There is that. So, heart and kidneys."
And brain.,"Nope, psychopathy is not a symptom."
It was yesterday.,"In the meantime, kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit."
"Protein lEvels, kidneys, arrhythmia. Could be paraneoplastic. I'd say lymphoma.",Get her to radiotherapy.
Then how about partially accurate?,"Those of you who haven't slept together, you can go. Everyone else, stay behind."
"Oh. Sorry. That was our secret, right?",Go have sex.
"No, thanks.","Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the lubricants. Just get me a receipt."
We have zero feelings for each other.,"Well, that's too bad, 'cause things worked much better when you did. Would it help if I slept with her?"
We were getting to a diagnosis.,"No, we were already at the diagnosis. You were creating a fake argument about an irrelevant treatment issue, 'cause you can't stand to be around each other. So have sex, fight or quit, I don't care. WhatEver you're doing now isn't working."
"Yeah, I'll do it now.","So when you watch Star Wars, which side do you root for?"
Dr. House. What are you doing?,Just checking in on your radiotherapy.
"From what I hear, you nEver visit Patients. And now, you've come to chat with me twice.",I want to know how you like being a Management consultant. I'm thinking of getting into it. That or psychopathy maybe. Which pays better?
I think you're already into one of them. Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday. She said I sound like you.,"I'm sure you understand what ""joke""ï¿½ means."
"So you're not just out for yourself? For example, you would nEver interrupt a sick Woman's treatment just because of some personal obsession?",Of course I'm self-interested. We all are. We're born that way. The rest of us are born with consciences.
Which is something you just sound ecstatic about.,I'm not saying it's logical. I'm just saying it's huMan.
I'd give her a day. Two days at the most.,"Great. You be the clock. Everyone else will be the doctors. Heart, kidneys, now liver."
Primary hepatic fibrosis?,That's our best guess. Start her on steroids.
No one's gonna risk their life to save hers.,"Man, one false accusation from a psychopath, and you turned out to be a real bummer. I'm gonna go see if Wilson has any liver left."
What are you doing?,Paying Wibberly's mortgage for a few months. Congratulations on another successful round of hectoring.
"Wait a minute, is that actually a check for him?",No. It's a giant novelty item for winning the lottery. You're just standing really far away.
"Of all the people to go the extra mile for, why this guy?",I don't know. He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.
Why not Cuddy? You nEver apologized after you defaced her photo.,Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorHouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.
"No, it's because Cuddy actually means something to you, which makes it much harder to apologize.","Oy. If it will make you shut up, I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo."
"Forget the photo. House, she was in love with you. And all she got in return was abuse. For years you toyed with her emotions.",She wasn't in love with me.
The fact that you still can't admit it just proves my point.,What do you want? Helping the guy was your idea.
"No, help the guy, whatEver... I'm just pointing out that it's much easier to soothe your guilt by throwing money at a stranger than by making amends to a person you actually care about.","You had me at ""much easier."" I'm gonna pretend to go to work now. Bing!"
"We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom. I spoke to her sister. She wasn't always like this. She changed, and right around adolescence.","So liver, heart, brain, can lie dorMant, and, it starts at puberty. The raw food diet made it go fulminant... Nuts are high in copper. It's Wilson's Disease."
We ruled that out. No keyser-fleischer rings.,There is one other sign. I know there are lipstick lesbians. Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?
She's not supposed to be here.,As a doctor. You didn't say anything about her capacity as a beautician's assistant.
Her fingernail's blue?,Yep. start her on chelation.
You're really doing this for me?,Tax shelter. I'll take some of that Parkli now.
I can't accept this.,"Fine. Forget the Parkli. Bye, Wibberly."
"I got an ""A+""ï¿½ with your paper. I was an orthopedic surgeon for ten years at New York Mercy. I had a gambling pRoblem. I tried to cover it by over-billing some medicare Patients. Lost my license. That's why I'm here. Not because of you.",Why are you telling me this now?
"Because I thought you'd be the same bastard you were in med school, but, uh...",Keep it.
"No, I can get another place.",Just take it. I screwed you over.
"You got me an ""A+.""ï¿½",Take it.
No!,Do I have to shove it down your throat? Take the damn check!
What are you doing?,Canoeing. But I seem to be taking on water.
This is not okay. Use your own bathroom.,"No canoe in my bathroom. My leg hurts. Soaking it makes it feel better. You were the one who had to have this condo. Maybe next time you should consider amenities, like two full baths, instead of just the joy of outbidding Cuddy."
The guy who signs the loan gets to pick the bedrooms. Stay out of mine.,"Well then, you owe me 35 bucks for the grab rail I installed."
"Well then, you owe me 35 bucks for the grab rail I installed.",Hit the kill screen. Boss is here.
It's not porn. It's our new Patient.,Bummer.
"22-year-old male ""ï¿½ 6'7"", 310 pounds. Clearly has brain involvement. The guy has no recollection of this entire incident.","Football player. Those are the ones that get hit in the head a lot, right?"
And he had a full psych evaluation. He's not crazy.,So it's roid rage. You don't think they grow them that big naturally.
ER also tested for steroids. He's clean.,Only proving that our guy got his hands on the good stuff.
The negative test at least means steroids is less likely. We should discuss other possibilities.,Why? He injects his sore ankles with lidocaine Every game. You think he's above injecting steroids?
Could cause the excess hormones that could cause the rage and would elude the ER Steroid test.,"Fine. Bilateral venous sampling to find the elevated GnRH. MRI to find the pituitary damage. Unless, of course, there is no pituitary damage, in which case, our guy got his hands on the good stuff."
"Fine. Bilateral venous sampling to find the elevated GnRH. MRI to find the pituitary damage. Unless, of course, there is no pituitary damage, in which case, our guy got his hands on the good stuff.","Foreman. Let the peasants handle the peasantry. Your brother needs to get picked up this afternoon... from prison. Your older brother, in case your confusion is related ""ï¿½"
How do you know about that?,He left a message. Said he couldn't get you on your cell or at home. I get it. You're busy. You'll pick him up the next time he comes out of prison.
Is that all?,You're officially unbusy. Family is family. Take the rest of the day. Go see your brother.
"Thank you, doctor.",There's nothing wrong with your eyes.
"Well, then your gizmo's broken. I'm seeing spots.","Or you enlisted, you got the cool haircut and the awesome pants, then you realized that your plane ticket to the Middle East was coach, and you decided to rethink your promise."
"No. I've already been there ""ï¿½ three deployments. Now they want me to go again. But my wife's pregnant.",So our homeland should be unsafe because your private was unsafe.
"Look, my wife and I planned this perfect. My enlistment was supposed to be over last week, so we got pregnant six months ago. Now they tell me I'm getting stop-lossed ""ï¿½ Army speak for they don't care about the fact that I've already finished my contract.",I don't care about the fact that they don't care.
"Hey, come on. I waited an extra hour just to make sure I got you.",Why?
I saw you limping out there. Vietnam?,Viet?!? How old do you think I am?
"I don't know, Vietnam age?","Well, back in my day, the real dodgers had the stones to run up to Canada or shoot themselves in the foot. They didn't come to free clinics whining for doctors' notes.

Are you gonna say it, or should I?"
You were right about the steroids. You're a genius.,Next time with feeling. Put the cheater on a somatostatin analog to clear it out of his system. Send him back to his football game.
"House, next time ""ï¿½ Marcus.","Oh, right. You two know each other."
"Uh, interviewing.",Oh! Who are we kidding? Interview's over. You got the job.
What job?,"My new assistant. Part of his parole ""ï¿½ he needs a job. Just trying to do my part."
You were wrong about the steroids. Patient had a paroxysmal tachycardia. We cardioverted him back to sinus rhythm. We're gonna get an EKG and a sestamibi scan. Marcus... let's talk outside.,Family is family.
"We spent all night, used all the fancy maParknes. Patient's heart looks fine.","Well, if it was fine, it wouldn't go aflutter just 'cause you walked into the room."
"Light whip, two extra shots.","Thank you, sir. Judging by the look on your face, I assume you're upset that big bro didn't take your advice and skip town."
He bought me breakfast.,"It was fun. Put lunch in the books, just you and me."
Our Patient could have a PFO.,"Well, naturally, you jump right to a urinary issue."
PFO's not urinary. It's a heart issue.,"It is? Hmm. Well, naturally, you think it's not a urinary issue, 'cause you're so embarrassed about your own past urinary issues, you don't dare broach the subject. Oh, come on. You spending the night over at Bobby Samson's."
I did not wet the bed. I spilled a drink.,"We're not buying it, Eric. We nEver bought it."
Hank Gathers? That's not what happened to him.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let your brother speak. What happened to Hank Gathers?"
I remember that.,Rage and tachycardia are warning signs.
Seriously? Because my brother remembers a basketball game?,"Hey, I don't care where an idea comes from, as long as it makes sense and embarrasses someone."
Are you out of your mind?,"As a former psyParkatric Patient, I take offense at that terminology."
All I did was ban you from my tub. WhatEver happened to proportional response?,WhatEver happened to coherent conversation?
What was that?,I have no idea. Everybody else thinks hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes sense? Good. Stick the Patient on a treadmill. Stress his heart until it stops.
You want to induce cardiac arrest?,"Only real treatment is for the Patient nEver to stress his heart again, which means we have to tell him to retire at the ripe old age of 21. Stopping his heart speaks louder than words. Go."
"The exterminator charged $250 to get the opossum out of there, and the contractor estimates $1,500 to fix the bathroom. And why are you jerking Foreman around?",Because it's fun. Maybe you should give those bills to the guy who left his own bathroom window open.
Your motives always run deeper than simple fun.,I want to learn more about one of my employees so that I can Manipulate him and destroy him if and when I choose. Information is power.
Not buying it.,Okay. Why don't you tell me my real evil plan?
"I don't think there is an evil plan. You regret not having a relationship with your own family, and you don't want to see Foreman go down that same path. I think you're actually! being nice.","Oh, shut up. You can't accuse me of an opossum attack and underhanded kindness in the same visit."
"If we can't re-create the cardiac Event, we can't prove hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",Either we find a bigger treadmill... or...
Either we find a bigger treadmill... or...,Did I miss the memo about you being released?
I'm feeling fine. I can't keep laying here in this bed missing practices.,All excellent points. Give me your arm.
What's in the shot?,"It's a vasodilator. Since we can't exercise your son's heart on the treadmill, I'm gonna have to do it chemically."
What's wrong?,You're turning white.
What does that mean?,It means he doesn't need football to get a good job anymore.

You're kidding me. You got him a desk?,And a nameplate. Man's got to have a place he can call his own.
Right. We should remove his spleen without confirmation so he won't miss the big game.,Hang an ethanol drip.
That won't treat for either lymphoma or Takayasu's.,"If it's lymphoma, the ethanol will make him itchy, and Foreman can remove his spleen. If it's Takayasu's, he'll lose his radial pulse, and Chase can start him on steroids."

Why bother? I missed my shot. What kind of life am I gonna lead now?,"Did you study really, really hard? Then the same crappy life that the rest of the guys you'll be graduating with are gonna lead... minus the student loans."
I heard Foreman and his brother are trying to work things out.,That's nice for them.
"It's nice of you. You didn't provoke Marcus to quit so the pranks would stop. You were becoming the common enemy they could bond over. You are the diabolical, yet benevolent puppet master.",I provoked Marcus to quit because he was no longer useful to me. I hired him to get information. I got information.
Uh-huh. And how are we gonna get back at Lucas?,We're not.
There's a pRoblem in the pharmacy.,"Hey, boss lady! You don't answer emergency pages anymore?"
Tell them all I'll be by as soon as I can and tell him I assumed it was either about the wolf again or the procedure I refused to approve yesterday.,"Turned out it wasn't a resistant staph, but I still say that if it had been, infecting him with malaria ""ï¿½"
"Seriously, House, I don't have time for this.",You're lying.
I have a meeting in 20 minutes.,Not talking about your meeting. I'm talking about the phone call.
"I didn't ask what you were talking about, because I don't care.",I was with your boytoy on a stakeout last night.
You were with Lucas?,He needed someone who could diagnose a soft tissue injury from across the street. Apparently he doesn't know any good doctors.
Or the ones he does know actually have lives outside of work.,"Things got a little slow, so we made some wagers. One being whether I could get you to stop the miscegenation with an emergency page."
"What made you think we'd ""ï¿½",He said you guys do it Every morning.
Everybody lies. Remember?,"So you weren't actually ""ï¿½"
"Good-bye, House.",I'm gonna need a definitive answer before any money changes hands.
I don't care what he told you. Turn it back up now.,Thought you had an important meeting.
You're an idiot. What are you gonna do the next time one of your Patients needs a liver transplant?,Go talk to Wilson about something completely unrelated and see what happens. Mystery infection guy is now covered in boils and has an abscess big enough to put your fist in. He needs to get into an OR tout suite.
Hourani will be done soon.,Good. I'll have some hot chocolate waiting.
No.,"If you really wanted to make a deal, you should have ditched the push-up and gone with a demi. Nothing makes a guy wanna close like high beams."

"Your meeting with the weasel lasted less than five minutes, which means you either agreed to a completely sensible 30-day extension or one of you issued a completely ridiculous ultimatum.","Oh, goody. You or him?"

His BP is plummeting. He has an elevated heart rate. Looks like congestive heart failure.,Interesting.
Since when is malaria a cure for heart failure?,It's not. It's not congestive heart failure. It's gotta be...
Get out of my chair. And the answer is no.,"You Ever noticed how Many porn sites have ""mom"" in the domain name? Hot moms, hungry moms, mature moms. That ought to make you feel pretty good."
What do you want?,"Looks like boils, altered mental status, and heart failure was caused by renal cell carcinoma. I need your signature to start treating it with malaria. Don't worry, I'm giving him chemo too."
What is your sudden obsession with malaria?,"Just trying to play my part cutting costs. Malaria is the simplest, cheapest method of delivering hypothermia."
"Right. The only money you care about ""ï¿½ You bet someone you could use malaria as a diagnostic tool?",That doesn't sound like me.
Forget it.,"Okay, let me see if I've got this straight, a bet that puts one Patient at minor risk is juvenile?"
And irresponsible and dangerous.,"But going all-in against Atlanticnet ""ï¿½"
Is not a bet. That is a carefully considered negotiating position.,I'm gonna put this in your inbox. I just hope it doesn't get lost underneath all the other stuff you're carefully considering.
What are you doing?,"Hey. Know any good transplant surgeons? Turns out his kidneys aren't the only thing failing. And I know what you're thinking, but malaria wouldn't destroy his liver that fast, especially since we nEver infected him."
"I thought you said ""ï¿½","Apparently Foreman now thinks that he has the authority to overrule my orders just because the FDA wouldn't approve. Don't worry. I'll deal with him. If you could just talk to Hourani ""ï¿½"
What would you do?,If you paged me during sex?
"About the contract, with Atlanticnet. I got them to come up to 8%, but we should get at least 12.","It's all numbers. Do the math, and nothing else."
It's not about my pride. It's about the principle. They're trying to screw us over because we're small.,That's what they're supposed to do.
"They should be pressuring other hospitals to be more like us, not trying to make us more like them. It's stupid.",Putting your job on the line in an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?
You would.,PRobably. But then I also wanted to try to cure cancer by infecting a guy with malaria to win a $50 bet. You really want to be like me?
What?,Would you rather I go back on vicodin?
She's not massaging your leg.,She will... Eventually.
Why am I the only person here who cares what happens to this hospital? Get off your ass and get your department under control. At least for the next few days.,Its gonna take longer than a few days for a company the size of Atlanticnet to start feeling the squeeze of your PR Campaign. If they Ever do.
And you know this how? From all the time you've spent researParkng them and their other contracts? The way they handle their press relations?,"I know they have a nascar team. Despite what you may have learned at hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff, sometimes the bigger they are, The harder they kick your ass."
What the hell is going on?,I told them to use their words.
You owe Lucas the money. We were having sex when you called.,"The breast milk guy finally found a doctor to give him what he wanted. If it works, it's way better than malaria. It's worth a shot."
I... I thought they were the ones bluffing. No way they'd let us terminate.,They're not gonna fire you. And you're not gonna quit.
Why not?,Because you're an idiot. This place needs you. And that matters to you.
"What do you think of that pharm tech, Gail?",She's a sociopath.
You knew she was stealing meds?,No. But have you seen the way she opens the mail?
Why didn't you Ever tell me?,Figured it might come in handy one day.
What are you doing tonight?,"Masturbating. I'd invite you, but people are already talking."
It's pathetic. You divide your nights between porn and the Discovery Channel.,Right. Playing Dance Dance Revolution is a much better choice.
"Okay, that was a gift from a Patient, and it happens to be great exercise. I mean, who rents porn anymore? Can't you get this stuff on the Internet?",You can. But you can't get disc two with the director's commentary.
Come out with me tonight. I'm going speed dating.,You mean you're dating on meth? Count me in.
"You need to meet somebody. This way, you meet 20 somebodies.",Over a five-minute discussion of Proust? Speed dating's a meat market.

Could be congenital thrombocytopenia.,Platelets look normal.
She's a blogger. I can't see her photos being anything but digital.,What does she blog? Politics? Dominatrix? Cooking? 'Cause I need recipes.

"Oh, come on. I'm not that good-looking.","Yeah, you are."
Not the whole relationship. Just the beginning.,The rest is your hair.
This is ridiculous. Women aren't as distracted by appearances as we are. They look deeper.,"You wanna bet? You can't tell anyone you're a doctor. You're unemployed.

We were wrong about the rat poison.,Coagulopathy plus kidney equals what?
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.,Normal creatinine lEvels.

So does Haff disease.,I'm not thanking you. I'm asking you why.
"Because if I did happen to bring a Woman home last night, I wanted it to be a porn-free zone.",You do realize things don't have to be socks to go into a sock drawer.
"I'm sorry. Horribly, horribly sorry. I thought you'd... watched them all.",You completely ruined my morning. I had to pull out your old family photos. Your mom was pretty hot. Haff disease fits the timing best. Start her on saline and Mannitol.

You should. Could be some clues.,Too Many. Be like doing a whole body scan. Send us up eight blind alleys. That's why Chase is doing it.
She mentions you.,She's nEver met me.

Guess what. You only returned two. You lost the third. It's decent of you to pay for it, not let them put it on my bill."
You know... I can explain what happened.,"I'm sure you could. But rather than listen to your lies, I thought it'd be more fun to drive all over town and get another copy."

"No, you've nEver treated a Patient with this name. I looked it up.",It's an assignment from my therapist.
"No, it wasn't. No one you respect would give you this and expect it to be helpful.",It's a book!

Hi. Thirteen's giving our Patient her third vaccine injection. She's responding well so far.,Where'd you get all these copies? It's out of print.
I called the author. He's got cartons of the thing in his basement.,You called him? What'd you say?
That I knew some people who could benefit spiritually from the book.,Did you mention me?
"Well, clearly it's not working. You have to stop the vaccine.",Sure. Give up. Let her die on schedule.
"Of the stimulating agent, which, added to the first injection, switched her immune reaction into overdrive.",Why was she sleeping? Who can sleep in a hospital during the daytime?

"Yes, but it persisted after we took her off the vaccine. What if it's a new symptom?","Okay. So we add fEver to cell atypia, coagulopathy, kidney, heart, liver..."
But which one? No one she knows is sick. She hasn't traveled anywhere. There's nothing in the history she gave us. Nothing in her blog.,There has to be something unique to this infection. Something about its transmission and the way it Manifests. There has to be something she's not telling us.
"There isn't. She's told us, and Everyone else, Everything.","Start her on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Since we know Everything, we might as well treat for Everything."

Why would it make more sense for you to read your father's book than to go talk with him?,Can you write a book? So I can stop talking to you?
You weren't looking for some big catharsis. You didn't want to hug the guy. You just wanted to know how his head works. How he thinks.,'Cause I'm fascinated with how ministers think.
"When you read that book, you were hoping that somewhere, underneath all that talk of God, there would be a way of thinking, a mind that you could recognize. You wanted what we all want.",The power to transform into any water-based object?
"To look across the gulf and know there's someone else like you. At least tell me this ""ï¿½ did you find something there?",Underneath the God stuff... More God stuff.
Would you mind at least putting a napkin under your jelly toast?,"Get a table, and I won't eat it on the couch."
"Yes, you will.",But I won't have a good excuse.
Why don't you go get a table?,Not my condo.
You have my permission. Pick out whatEver you want.,"Then it would be a reflection of me, not you. That wouldn't be right."
"No, it would be a reflection of the fact that the guy who's been mooParkng off of me for as long as I can remember, isn't a complete ingrate.",You've nEver furnished a home.
I have furnished a bunch of homes.,"No, you've married a bunch of women, who furnished a bunch of homes."
You want to eat off something? Fine. Move your piano in here and eat off that.,You're afraid.
"Of a dining table? You know, they don't actually come to life when you put a knob off your bedpost on them.","You are what you sit in. Your friends, your job, your furnishings ï¿½ it all defines you."
You don't really beliEve that. You just don't want to do the shopping.,"Buy some furniture, or admit that you're empty inside."
"That means she only had one or two drinks, tops.",And there's no sign of trauma.
How'd you know?,"Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't have needed me to take the case."
How do you know Cuddy!?,"Foreman's the only one with the balls to take a case without checking with me, and he's still working on breakfast. Which means that the... 18... no, 17-year-old honor student ï¿½"
"Cuddy has a soft spot for smart girls, and they don't start drinking until second semester, senior year.","So either you think that smart women look out for each other, which means you're an idiot, or you think Cuddy's not smart, which means... well, I guess it's the same both ways."
Then how did you ï¿½,Picture fell out of the file. She looks smart. Where's Taub?
You don't already know?,"Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife. I'm just curious what he wanted me to know."
Two drinks is hardly a binge.,"Certainly not if you're an Aussie. But when an American schoolgirl has two drinks before 10:00 am, it's a pretty sure bet that the plan is to have a lot more. PRobably wasn't the first time she had that plan."
We'll get a C-13-pyruvate MRI to check for cardiac lactic-acid lEvels.,Someone call Taub. Tell him to cut the ball and chain on his own time.
It could be fastidious enteric bacteria.,"You think she's been eating your wife's cooking? Hey, I'm on your side, Man."
I am not fighting with my wife. I had a flat tire. It's in my trunk. You can go look at it if you want.,Don't need to. Face tells me you're bluffing. Not yours ï¿½ Chase's.
"If that valve is about to dehisce, echo could trigger a heart attack.",So come up with a better idea or have a crash cart ready.
The dissection means we were wrong about alcohol causing a hypertensive crisis.,"And by ""we"" you mean ""you."""
Yeah. You were the one who didn't have any better ideas.,It's not my fault. I was busy trying to Judge Taub.
Unless it was inside her.,Meaning?
Could be some kind of neuropathy. Syphilitic lightning pains?,It's not syphilis. VDRL and enzyme immunoassays were negative.
What about a blood clot?,While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery?
Interstitial nephritis?,Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.
But cancer could.,Would you care to be a little more specific?
We could do a full-body scan.,We hate full-body scans.
"And by ""we"" you mean ""you."" We also hate when a Patient dies before we figure out what's wrong with them.",Do the scan.
What do you think?,I think you work quickly.
"Piece of cake, you give them money, they give you furniture. Not bad, huh?","Nope. It's not ""bad""ï¿½ at all."
Whatcha doing?,"If there was any sign of inflammation of the aorta, that would make sense."
House! It's not funny. I got enough pRoblems already.,Trust me. This is gonna help.
An aneurysm explains the hallucinations. And it's the one thing we haven't excluded from the differential.,Your texting does not prove you're faithful. It just proves you know she thinks you're unfaithful. Can't force trust. What did she hallucinate?
The content of the hallucination isn't relevant.,Not usually.
Not Ever.,"We know nothing, brain knows all. You get an ulcer, you don't know it, but the brain increases mucin secretions. It knows what the pRoblem is, knows where the pRoblem is."
"Sure. That's the same as the brain shouting, ""you have pancreatic cancer.""",Her subconscious is trying to tell her something. We need to eavesdrop.
"She was screaming she was being sucked into a black hole, so, we should look for a tumor in her anus?",We need the whole story. The cognitive pattern recognition program might tell us what's going on in her head.
"Or we could act on something based in science, not science fiction. Get an MRA with contrast to see if she has an aneurysm, unless you think Cuddy's gonna go for the mind reading.","Fine. Do the MRA. When it comes back negative, we can move on to the... crazy but possible ideas."
What did you do with the furniture?,I returned it.
You told me to buy it.,"But you didn't buy it. You rented it. You made one phone call to Economy Furniture Supply ï¿½ ""we get it done so you don't have to."""
"So what? We had a table, chairs ï¿½",But no clue what any of it meant.
Fine. I'll hire a decorator.,Perfect. Another Woman to tell you who you are.
I'll hire a male decorator.,Step inside one furniture store and find one thing you like.
"I like, not doing this.",One.
Inner-ictal E.E.G. showed no synchronous discharges.,And the MRA?
No aneurysms or arterial or venous malformations in the brain.,As predicted. What did we say we'd move on to?
"Temporoparietal junction was clean on MRI, MRA, and whole-body scan.","Which just leaves us with the question of, what happened during the out-of-body experience?"
"If I say her blood pressure shot up over 200 and she bit her tongue, would that be a satisfactory answer?",Sure. If you then went on to answer the following ï¿½ Did she float above her body? Did she see Jesus? Did she bathe in the Ganges?
"No, no, and no. Can we get back to the medical science?",No.
"Even if we can get the equipment, it takes hours for the initial mapping. If she has another seizure, she could stroke out.","Coincidentally, she could also have a stroke if we do nothing."
I'm not telling a mother who's scared out of her mind that our best shot is a magic trick.,"It's not magical. It's experimental. Just like washing your hands after pooping once was. And technically, it's not our best shot. I'm pretty sure it's our only shot."
"It's not magical. It's experimental. Just like washing your hands after pooping once was. And technically, it's not our best shot. I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.","Perfect. So, Foreman, go get her consent. The rest of you go down to the cog sci lab. Equipment should already be there."
"And I want to, but ï¿½","Inspiration point doesn't open till after dark. Got a real cool magic show about to start. Also, I'm gonna need to check your spare."
"Well, it's taken us just over an hour to prove that she has a very boring subconscious.",Anyone Ever tell you you can be a real buzzkill?
Stars? Maybe that's a stripe?,It's the sky. She's thinking about the moon and the stars and the sky.
"Or, star could be a white blood cell. Leukemia?",Who's that?
Her dad? He died when she was eight.,What did daddy die of?
What do you think it means?,"She likes school, and she has daddy issues ï¿½ Neither of which helps us."
"Liver's responsible for proteins, immunological effects, production of red blood cells. Might be able to explain the lungs, the hallucinations.",Not the aortic dissection.
"Kidneys are also failing. We add in polycystic disease, could explain the dissection.","So that's one imperfect theory, plus a rare complication of a second theory, which gives us a complete explanation. Don't polish the notion, Foreman."
What if it's obscuring a tumor? It's the only place we couldn't look inside.,Get a better look at her pineal gland with three tesla fast spin echo MRI.
MRI rEvealed no remarkable features on her pineal gland. But there were slightly elevated lEvels of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.,Which we would expect to see if there was an allergic reaction happening.
Parasite? There's this Middle Eastern parasite ï¿½,"How exactly do you want to be shot down? On the basis of the fact that she's nEver been within 6,000 miles of the Middle East, or on the basis of the fact that all our scans and urine samples came back clean? And yet she's still failing, system after system. So, either we find the answer at autopsy or..."
What?,I got nothin'.
"I was gonna head out. If there's any change, I assume you'll page me?","Are you having an affair? Does it bother you that your wife doesn't have the guts to actually ask that question, and I do?"
"On both ends, yes.","Difference is, I'm not afraid of the answer. And I might beliEve you."
I'm not having an affair.,But you want to.
"No, I don't. I'm through living like that.","Why? What, you finally got to the point where half your age plus sEven just isn't young enough?"
"Talk to you later, House.",Or is it because you now really are old enough to be their ï¿½ The dad. Does he travel for work?
"What do you mean, ""does he""? He died almost ten years ago.","Not hers, her boyfriend's. He's the one in her visions."
"Not hers, her boyfriend's. He's the one in her visions.",I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.
Oh.,"It's a mouthful, but pRobably not as tricky as your title."
"Um, okay. Is Abby gonna be all right?",Do you travel a lot?
"Yeah, I have a food-import business. Why?",Where'd you go?
"All over ï¿½ France, Italy, the mediterranean. Why?",I think you exposed her to a parasite.
Oh. I thought the scans didn't show any.,Because she doesn't have any.
But you just said ï¿½,"It's cool. My theory is that her body was able to kill off the parasite, but what it couldn't do was get rid of the shell, which doesn't show up on the scans. That little piece of microscopic garbage set off an allergic reaction called cerebellar sParkstosomiasis delayed hypersensitivity allergy, or cusdehaaa. Risky, unpleasant treatment, but completely curable."
"Well, that's fantastic.","You'd think so, wouldn't you? Only thing is, did you Ever have sex with your son's girlfriend?"
Where the hell do you get off asking ï¿½,"Shut up! See, I can't treat this unless I can confirm it, and the only way she could have been exposed to this parasite is sexually, which means she's gonna die very soon unless you admit that you slept with her."
Dad? What's going on?,"Gee, this is bad, because you now have to choose between her living and the truth becoming public. And frankly, given what the truth is, it's a tough call."
You'd broken up.,Your girlfriend is not allergic to your semen. She's allergic to the Egyptian parasite swimming around in your dad's semen.
I was drunk. We both...,"No need to explain. Technically, she was legal."
"Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait!","Hey... All things considered, it's actually great news."
So what do you think?,"You wussed out, and used a decorator."
Why can't that be me ï¿½ The wuss who loves decorators?,'cause it's not.
Okay. It's not. But don't return it. I can't keep doing this.,You have to. You can't keep letting other people define you.
You have to. You can't keep letting other people define you.,Not another elephant.
Not another elephant.,Decorator didn't pick this.
You're gonna have to buy your own cape.,"I like what this says about you, Wilson."
"Oh, it's beautiful.",What'd you tell him?
That it doesn't mean she doesn't love him.,And he bought it?
It's true.,Your wife say yes?
How did you know ï¿½,"Monkey see, monkey do. At least he has the young and stupid excuse."
She said yes.,Good for you.
We cannot allow anyone to leave the hospital at this time. All personnel should remain in their staging areas unless otherwise instructed by security.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotta clear the ï¿½"
I think I can live with that.,"You're on two milligrams of morphine an hour. How the hell are you still awake? No, don't tell me. Ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the blood's not reaParkng your gut, you have intestinal hypoperfusion. That'd be stronger than the narcotics."
The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.,She was being kind.
"You're Dr. House, aren't you?","Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date."
"The limp. Yeah, I read about you. I sent you a letter before they knew what was wrong. Tried to get you to take my case.","Yeah, well, you should have kept reading. Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade."
This doesn't bother you?,You talking with your mouth full? A little.
"I meant the fact that you're standing here watParkng me die because of my ""ï¿½ my file bored you.",I take maybe 1 in 20 cases. A lot of the people I turn down end up dying. It's really a good argument for there being more than one me when you think about it.
One? I beliEve he wears a larger size.,"No cards, no flowers, not Even a phone call. Let me guess. LightHouse keeper."
I was a classics professor at Princeton for 26 years. Mostly research.,"So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago. That must be it. Not that you have no friends because, say, you're a miserable bastard."
What do you care?,"The next few hours are gonna be grim. There'll be nausea, pain, no company, as soon as I can get myself out of here. I can unlock the regulator. You can put yourself in a narcotic haze, sleep blissfully to the end."
"Oh, is that a favor to me or to you?",Win-win.
"No, thanks.",Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case?
You think a classicist doesn't beliEve in fate?,"You think Odysseus would lie whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed? Come on, take my offer. Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out."
Bad pain day?,Bad pain month.
"Since I'm not using it... Oh, if you don't want the morphine, you must have something of your own, Hmm?","I was in rehab. I had a little pRoblem with the something of my own. Now all I take is ibuprofen, and it's two flights up."
For the whole month?,The pain's migrated. I think the arterial wall is damaged.
"What, you don't know?",I haven't had an arteriogram yet.
And you don't want the test. In case the arterial wall is fine. Which would mean that the pain is coming from something else. What's her name?,Interesting... That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love. You're projecting. So what's her name?
What time is it?,"What does it matter to you? It's ""t"" minus four hours. 8:20. Now tell me who she is and what are the pathetically long odds that she's gonna visit or call. And why that's a reason not to take the morphine."
"Dr. Taub, comma, Christopher Michael.",So this is what it comes down to in the final hours. Deifying some lost love. Hoping to get her on the phone and make Everything perfect. It's pathetic. Either you left her for a reason or she left you for a reason. A phone call is not ï¿½
It's my daughter.,So why isn't she here?
"I left my family... when Gracie was six. I was sort of forced out, actually, after I'd had an affair with a student.",For sex or love?
"Neither. I'd only married Gracie's mother because of the baby. But I didn't think I could handle commitment, and, like any decent academic, I proved myself right.",And what time it is matters because?
"She's a dance teacher in Atlanta. She gets home from work at 9:00, and I just wanted to speak to her one more time. That's my story. What's yours?",Same thing. Pretty much.
I'm gonna be dead in a few hours. Your secrets couldn't be safer. Unless you're keeping them from yourself.,"I like being alone. At least I convince myself that I'm better off that way. And then I met someone! at a psyParkatric hospital, of all places. She changed me. And then she left. We're better off alone. We suffer alone. We die alone. Doesn't matter if you're a model husband or father of the year. Tomorrow will be the same for you."
We nEver really did have a proper good-bye.,It's 9:00.
I guess she's running late.,You don't seem that surprised. That's what you expected to get. You waited until you knew she'd be out.
"Her aunt said that she starts work late. Every now and then, I just call to hear her voice on the maParkne. I was nEver there when she needed me, so... What right do I have to need her now?",None. Just means you're a hypocrite. 'Cause apparently you do. Forget about rights. Just tell her what you need to tell her.
Dr. House? Lockdown ended a few minutes ago.,Yeah. I know. I'm sorry I didn't take your case.
We need an ambulance at the Camden Fairgrounds.,You're new.
You're naked.,"And, for the record, a little bit cold."
"I'm sorry, I didn't know that anyone was home. James had an early call, and I was just leaving.",Without breakfast?
"I'm fine, thanks. I'm Sam, by the way.",House. Nice to meet you.
It'd be nicer if you'd put this on.,So you and Wilson...
Thought you were staying in New York last night.,"Sorry, must have missed the ""if this trailer be a-rockin'"" sign out front."
I had a dream like this once. It didn't end well.,"Huzzah, my loyal peasants!"
"House, what are you doing?","Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl at the Goldstein bris. While I'm busy, you all can check out the Knight down in the E.R., who, instead of seizing the throne, just seized."
He works at a Renaissance Festival?,"Doesn't work there, he lives there as part of a wonderful little troupe, who spend their weekends reenacting a nobler age, when people crapped in the streets, and Thirteen would have been a grandmother."
"Weeks, not weekends. Says here he's been camping out for a month.",Try doing that with a pen.
Why don't you put that down before you kill one of us?,"Better idea, why don't you give me something I can use so I won't feel the need to?"
"A full set of armor would protect against visible trauma, but not transmitted concussive force. Could be a subdural hematoma.",You're forgetting to demonize.
"An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.",No. Two demon eyes. Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.
Could be an allergic reaction to something from the Renaissance Fair.,"Which is why we need to check out Middle-earth. Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits."
I still think a hematoma is more likely.,That's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.
But you justï¿½,"I said Frodo, not Gollum."
I don't Even know who Frodo is.,"Who's the Parkck, and why are you hiding her?"
You were home last night?,"And this morning. I bumped into your babe, naked."
I told you to stay out of my bathroom.,I was in the kitchen.
She was naked in the kitchen?,I was naked.
Why the hell were you naked in the kitchen?,"Uh, it's not important right now. What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place. Is she married?"
No.,A Patient?
I don't have time for this.,She used to be a Man.
House!,"She wants to be a Man. Sam ï¿½ it's a Man's name, short for..."
"She wants to be a Man. Sam ï¿½ it's a Man's name, short for...",SaMantha. The soulless harpy you were married to before we met.
"People change, House.","Sure. They get older, ovaries start drying up, and nice guys like you look attractive again."
"Listen, I know that, in your own demented way, you think you're looking out for me. But I have this.","By this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach. Fine. I get it. It's your life. You go screw it up. I can wait."
For what?,"To tell you, ""I told you so."""
That's not exactly sanitary.,Fun stuff nEver is.
A lumbar puncture could confirm.,"Except it's not food poisoning. If it was, the E.R. would look like Camelot right now."
I think they call that breakfast in Australia.,"No one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was."
To what?,That's what I sent you to Middle-earth to find out. Run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.
"That's gonna take time, and he's getting worse.",So treat him with epinephrine too.
"It's definitely not an allergy, or the epi would have helped him, not made him worse.",Unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure. Sodium bisulfite ï¿½ the preservative that keeps epi peppy ï¿½ can cause tachycardia.
Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus?,Lord have MRSA.
You weren't wearing gloves when we shocked his heart back into rhythm.,"I'm sure you'll be fine. You two get a sample to the lab to confirm, you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. antibiotics. You... stay away from me."
"I'm sure you'll be fine. You two get a sample to the lab to confirm, you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. antibiotics. You... stay away from me.",Need to talk.
"About the MRSA? I know, we'reï¿½","MRSA, shmrsa. Something important."
"Something you think is more important than the potentially lethal bacteria spreading like wildfire through my hospital? Well, that narrows it down to something personal and stupid.",Wilson.
Theory confirmed. He is dating his first wife. I know.,I don't beliEve it.
That he didn't ask your permission first?,"No, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me."
"Well, you'd be surprised how Many things Wilson doesn't tell you.",Would I? Like ï¿½ like how you slept with your father's best friend or...
I'm gonna kill him.,You need to break them up.
Forget it.,So you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time? You remember what he was like after that?
"Yes, I do.","Well, then do something. God knows he's not gonna listen to me. You, on the other hand, have decades of experience dating and being attracted to losers. Obviously, I don't include myself."
You know what happens when you interfere in other people's relationships?,"Of course. I do it all the time. Hmm, I see your point."
I took on three guys in college once.,Hope they bought you dinner first.
It's not MRSA.,"I know, it's poison Ivy."
"A sEvere reaction could cause the blisters and maybe irritate his eyes enough to cause the hemorrhaging, but the chest pain and seizures...",They have bonfires Every night. The burning leaves aerosolizes the oil. We've seen what it's done to the outside of his body. Imagine what it's doing to his lungs and his sinuses.
"Okay, maybe it remotely fits, but I'd rather go with scientific evidence than with your gut.","How about this? Apparently, it's all over his sword."
He would have had symptoms way before the Renaissance Festival.,"Which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system, which means it has to be some other environmental toxin. Yesterday he was a healthy Knight, today he's Sleeping Beauty. Nothing else fits."
We already ruled out food poisoning. Both the butcher shop and the food stands at the fair were totally clean.,Then he ate the poison apple somewhere else. Or maybe you just missed it. Start treatment for triParknosis and confirm with a muscle biopsy.
Hey. I can't beliEve I'm about to say this. Sam!,Told you so.
"No, she didn't dump me. She wants to get to know you better.",Damn it. I nEver should have let her see me naked.
"It goes against all my instincts, but I said all right.",Why?
She thinks I was hiding her from you.,You were.
I don't want her to know.,So you're asking me to condone a relationship based on lies and mistrust.
Yeah.,When and where?
"Tonight, Venezia, 8:00.",What am I gonna wear? All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.
"House, listen. I know you're worried about me, and I also know that that kind of unselfishness doesn't come naturally to you. But I don't want your help. I don't need your help. Just come to dinner and be your usual selfish self.",How could I say no?
That.,"Sorry we're late. But you know girls. Always fiddling with the hair and the makeup. James, Sam.... this is Sarah."
It's nice to meet you. Horace has told me allï¿½,House.
"I know, isn't it amazing?","Yeah, delightful."
"I recommend we start with a full cancer workup, starting with theï¿½",Which one of you checked out the apartment?
House...,His symptoms fit an environmentalï¿½
"The test results don't, we redidï¿½",Search the apartment.
He hasn't been there in three weeksï¿½,Go! Now!
Of what?,Plumbum nigrum.
"It's Latin, for black lead.",Our Knight/Warlock apparently also dabbles in alchemy.
"Seizures, paralysis, weak immune system, and Eventually, coma.","Biopsy the cysts, and you'll find your lead."
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?,"Wouldn't need a team if I did all the work, now, would I? Plus, I had to make you dinner."
We have plans.,I bet your plans don't taste like this.
"Don't! House, whatEver it is that you're up to",I'm trying to be nice. What I did the other night was juvenile. I'm sorry.
The souffle was amazing.,"It's my mom's recipe. Everything else, I got off the Web."
Here's to the Internet.,"Where I found the lamb ragout, and you two found each other... Again."
"Yeah, more like, divorce, depression, therapy, more therapy, and the Internet.",And here we are.
"Well, I need to go to the bathroom.","I think you're old enough, now. But if you would like me to come along with you..."
"Come on, James. Enough, already.","Yeah, James, I cook in peace."
Okay. I'll be right back.,"You're a cold-hearted bitch, who ripped his heart out. I watched him struggle for years to overcome the damage you did. And there's no way I'm going to just let you reel him back in so you can do it all over again."
And all this?,Phase two of getting to know my enemy.
"You're wrong about me. But I'm glad now I don't have to pretend to like you, except for when James is standing next to me.","Same here. Only difference is, I'll outlast you."
"Same here. Only difference is, I'll outlast you.",End scene.
"Well, it's too late for the movie. Wanna see what's on tv?",Absolutely.
We had to shock it back into rhythm twice during the night.,There's only one thing left to do.
We're wasting our time.,"Actually, I've already gotten good value."
"I told you, there's nothing here that could have caused any of his symptoms.","No, you told me that you couldn't find anything here that could be causing the symptoms."
"And now we're gonna find something new because we're in costume? We looked Everywhere, tested Everything. Just because Wilson's acting stupid doesn't mean we are.",Do you think he's making a mistake?
"Of course. But he'll figure it out, sooner or later. Hopefully, after a few weeks of great sex. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.",Wilson's not like us. He cares too much about people and their feelings.
Thanks for the compliment.,"The code that our Knight claims to live by, all that crap about honor and Parkvalry. Wilson's naturally like that, which is why he'sï¿½"
A great guy.,A sucker and a target. So we gotta look out for him. Do you smell that?
"I cry your pardon, Sir.",You know what this is?
"Well, that's lavender.",Try rose hips.
"Both harmless, who cares?",It could be cyanide as far as he knows. How about this?
It be nothing but St. John's Wort.,Wrong again. Black cohash.
Hey! I just organized all that.,You know what this is?
A wild carrot?,"It's hemlock, you embossed carbuncle."
That's hemlock? You sure?,Did you sell it to anyone?
It was just one branch.,You sold it to Sir William?
No. To the King.,It's the only part of the environment you didn't check. The people living in it.
What's going on? Why can't we see William?,Because you poisoned him. Your royal anus. With this.
Wild carrots?,Hemlock. I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.
"He's still alive. You want to avoid a murder charge, start talking fast.",The apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.
"Okay, yeah, maybe I bought it for the food challenge, but I didn't know that was hemlock.","If it was for the challenge, then why is wee Willie the only Knight who's dying?"
The main markers of hemlock intoxication.,"Well, the good news is we now know what's wrong with you. The bad news is that your King's precious ideals were just pretend after all. At least, when it comes to guys who get too close to his Queen."
It's not true.,"I guess you've nEver heard the expression, ""gas chromatography maParknes don't lie."""
Neither does Miles. He's the best Knight I've Ever known. It's why he was chosen King.,Miles is a jealous idiot. And you're just an idiot.
"Uh, something's wrong. We performed a gastric lavage and administered activated charcoal, but he's getting worse, not better.","Well, it's been in his system two days. We're lucky he's lasted this long."
"Don't do it! WhatEver you're planning, especially if you're gonna use that thing. Geez.",It was just sitting in a stone.
"Here. It's gonna cost extra, because of the lEvel of detail that you wanted.","Anything good? And by good, I, of course, mean bad."
"Nope, pretty much your typical life. Married young, got divorced. Married a little less young, got divorced. She's been pretty successful in Everything she's done, except marriage.","Well, there's gotta be something I can use."
Maybe. Didn't read her shrink's notes. Didn't seem right.,But stealing them did.
"Sure. Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.",Careful. I have a sword.
"I don't agree with what you said. But I understand why you said it. We were married young, we both made mistakes, and yes, I did make most of them. But that was almost a decade ago.","I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?"
"I'm not asking you to like me, House. To be honest, I think you're an ass. But we do have one thing in common. We care about James.",So prove it. And dump him... again.
"You're pretty much insufferable all the time, aren't you?","Sorry, go on. And, yes."
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.,"We did it. Well, I did it."
What exactly did we do? You do?,"These aren't focal hepatic lesions on his liver, they're peliosis hepatis lesions. Which in combination with an erratic heart rate, usually indiCatesï¿½"
Endocarditis. Infection on his heart valve.,Two major symptoms of anabolic steroid abuse.
And the rhabdo makes the third.,Our Patient's a juicer. Ancient poison accelerated the damage of the modern poison. Start treatment; let the King out of the tower.
"As much as I would love to clog my arteries, I have a 10 o'clock CT and I still have to race home, get changed.",He's just trying to get into your skirts. And I don't mean metaphorically.
"Bye, House.",Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.,I said I'd stay out of it. .
What?,Nothing.
"Clearly, SOMETHING.",Nope.
"House, on a list of your attributes, there's nothing that Even rhymes with ""coy.""","Okay, I may have seen something in the fridge. Like the end of your relationship. She put the milk in the door and not on the shelf."
It's not a big deal.,"You hate that she did that, but you didn't say anything."
You're trying to get us to fight.,"No, I'm trying to help. If you got an issue, let her know."
I should have known that you weren't done sabotaging this.,"Fine. Stew in your irritation. And sure, last time it bubbled over into resentment and rage, leading ultimately to a painful divorce that neither of you Ever really recovered from, but I'm sure this time it'll be great."
Animals also eat their young and kill their rivals. That make it weird that most of us don't?,Says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over how Many women who aren't his wife?
Our Patient's unhappy because she's suffering from an intestinal blockage.,Boring. Then we have to find a reason to rule it out.
Herpes might not register if she was exposed in the last six weeks.,But it would show up on a barium enema.
Wait. You're gonna do it?,Barium coats the inner lining of your colon. Lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.
I'm on painkillers. I'd rather this not be what you think of Every time you look at my butt. .,"Okay, roll onto your side. It's fill 'er up time. So is Evelyn his new squeeze?"
She's our daughter.,Must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!
She's six. She knows as much about our sex life as any other kid her age.,You can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.
"You've been in the room five minutes. You got us all figured out. Of course, you left out the part where we love each other and we want to grow old together.",But you just don't want to be young together.
But you just don't want to be young together.,Tank's full. I'll page the radiology elves.
"It stopped hurting during the X-ray, which means it was just an intestinal blockage that passed. We should discharge her.",Absolutely. There's no need to find any underlying cause 'cause these things nEver happen twice. Take her digestive system for a test drive. Give her a radio-opaque milkshake. X-ray Every 15 minutes to see if it makes any unscheduled stops on the way through.
We'll be here all night.,"No, Taub will be here all night. Talk to the unicorn and then tell me you don't beliEve. ."
Guy's got a license to drill. Why would he lie about not using it?,"That's not the lie. The lie is that he gives a crap about how his wife feels. If they're both screwing around, that's one thing. But if she has a piece on the side and he doesn't, the only way he'd be okay with that is if he's betraying her in some other way that, in his mind, makes them Even. My unicorn isn't a unicorn. It's a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face."
"No, no, no. He's not being cynical. He's assuming the husband is doing something to Even the score, which means he thinks there is a score, which means, cheating swans aside, House beliEves in monogAmy. He's being roMantic. .",What I beliEve is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous. Doesn't matter if I think there's a score. I guarantee you he does. Any of the wife's partners pan out?
She's been with two people other than Tom in the last six months. Neither of them have been outside the tri-state area.,So we're back to the husband.
You just said you beliEvedï¿½,He's doing something behind her back. What better cover than a business trip to Nebraska? Like that's really a place.
"So paralysis, arrhythmia, and intermittent abdominal pain.","And he nicked himself shaving. Sorry. That was Taub. But it was easier to solve. Means he used the crappy razor in his locker, which means he slept here."
Thanks to you. I brought up open marriage with Rachel. It was a disaster.,"On the medical front, we've knocked out sex and foreign travel. Could be an electrolyte imbalance."
You pushed me into this.,"Figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest. Either way, you win."
"Increased libido can be a symptom of adrenocortical carcinoma, which also explains her other symptoms.",Just because Everybody in this room wishes that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so. Get an MRI of her adrenal glands.
"If he has a secret, I highly doubt it's more relevant than the clot.","Clotting disorder would explain Everything. Question is, which one?"
Do you read any of your departmental memos?,"Only the ones labeled, ""n-s-f-w."""
"Only the ones labeled, ""n-s-f-w.""","Sorry, that's ""n-n-s-f-w."""
"Sorry, that's ""n-n-s-f-w.""","Oh, I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them."
We'll just give you a few minutes toï¿½ .,"By ""we,"" she means ""she."" ."
It's not medically relevant. You're not gonna care.,Wilson's been teaParkng me how to care. Try me.
He builds wind turbines and leases them out to local power companies.,"You're right. I don't care. . Clotting disorder: DIC. Factor five leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome."
"Congratulations, House. Sam ended it.",Go test our Patient's blood!
But it can wait five minutes.,! for Everything we discussed. I'm sorry.
"Or you could have stayed out of it. I could have kept my mouth shut, been annoyed sometimes, but I'd be happy, because I'd still be with her. . Now all I have is cold milk.","As long as you're free, you want to grab some dinner?"
All our tests came back negative. It's not a clotting disorder.,"Which means we need to come up with a better idea. So what causes pRoblems in the stomach, heart, nerves? ."
"Which means we need to come up with a better idea. So what causes pRoblems in the stomach, heart, nerves? .","Oh, my God."
No sign of sParkstocytes or hemolysis. So you're actually going to sleep with another Woman then go home to your wife?,Thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important.
Taub was gonna do all of that anyway. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.,Imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery. Here's a thought ï¿½ Taub's wife is now totally on the market. Mind hitting me with her digits?
Get the portable ultrasound in here. We need to get a look at her belly.,"Pain, pain went away, came back another day. Question is, what brought it back?"
Patient. Abdominal pain.,"Yeah, he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6. Taub turns back into a faithful pumpkin at midnight."
"My point was that arousal is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system. If that's where the pRoblem is, the pain could be triggered by crying, which seemsï¿½","PNS also controls digestion, which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here."
"When this happens in adults, it's usually a sign of abdominal cancer. We'll fix the overlap, and then search your intestine for tumors.",Foam?
I have a bad feeling about this.,"Nothing. That's the beauty. I genuinely tried to help Wilson. I told him to stand up for himself, which you know is legitimate advice. And his relationship blew up."
So you're paying it forward?,"If this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex, so be it."
Or her declining kidney function. We ran panels during surgery.,"Actually, IBD does make sense, 'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis, which would explain the heart and the kidneys. Start her on sulfasalazine and TNF inhibitors. Oh, and Taub, I'm not gonna see you before you head off for Gomorrah. Just remember, if you get disoriented! breathe through your nose and look for the horizon."
"We've gone from too few ideas to too Many, and our Patient's running out of time.",Why the lack of afterglow? Physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?
"I can't hurt Rachel like that. Sickle cell anemia would have shown on blood tests. No flattened intestinal villi rules out celiac. Seriously? Our Patient's dying, and we can't move past my sex life?","Seriously, you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?"
And it can't be Henoch-Schonlein purpura. No inciting respiratory infection and no rash.,I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.
Sarcoidosis makes sense too.,Good. Treat for those three.
"""O"" for three. Her kidney function is still declining. We're gonna need to start dialysis.","Glad the husband's back. After missing so Many little deaths, he should be here for the big one. Top six, anyone?"
Polyarteritis nodosa?,"We'd have seen some improvement on prednisone. Guy's wife's dying, and he stops to buy flowers."
They're from his garden. Mercury poisoning fits.,"Those are lilacs. My mom used to grow lilacs. My dad made her get rid of them, 'cause there were too Many bees. We ruled out HSP 'cause there was no inciting respiratory infection. But in rare cases, it can also be triggered by a bee sting."
We also ruled it out because there's no rash.,Maybe we just didn't see it.
Maybe we just didn't see it.,Have you been stung by a bee recently?
I don't.,"Not that you know of. Okay, I'm gonna have to check your holes. I'll start with the mouth. If there's nothing there, then things might have to get kinky. Say aah."
Aah.,I was kinda hoping for kinky.
I'm gonna be okay. I love you.,"That is adorable. Other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes, and him bankrupting your family, I think you kids are pretty much home free."
And!,You two made up?
You two made up?,You can thank me later.
"Esteban, start getting ready.",I met the neighbors.
I don't need a temporary. I need a perManent. Yesterday. Please do.,Good morning.
"Hardly. One of my P.A.s quit an hour ago, and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.",That's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
Any bed you're in is the wrong one.,That's not what your mama said. Oh! Snap.
I'll be going now. To HuMan Resources.,"He started it. It was the neighbor's kid's bed. Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy."
How drunk were you?,About yea drunk.
"Are you okay? You shouldn't be drinking at all, much lessï¿½",You sound just like Esteban's mom.
I need you in the clinic.,"Sorry, I'm busy."
"Sorry, I'm busy.","Tell me you have a case. You know, Even if you don't."
I have a case.,Sounds interesting. I'll take it. I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.
I really do have a case.,We're Even.
We're Even.,You guys know how to Honeymoon.
He can't speak.,"""Aphasia"" is Greek for loss of voice."
"We've ruled out infection, vocal cord damage, and stroke.","A lot of guys syncope at the altar. It's Greek for ""having the vapors."""
"We ruled out all the common causes of fainting: Low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydration.","Don't say ""ah."""
Do you know what it is?,Roll on your side and lift up your gown.
Roll on your side and lift up your gown.,There's one thing they didn't test for.
A test for what?,Faking.
Ow!,Test was positive.
Iï¿½ I canï¿½ I can talk. Iï¿½ I wasn't faking. My voice just came back right now.,"Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince."
I know he wasn't faking.,"Well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper."
What about the syncope?,"Well, theï¿½"
"Well, theï¿½",Is she buying this too?
Why would he fake anything?,"Kryo podia. It's Greek for ""duh."" Still, you get to keep the engagement ring."
I don't think he was faking.,"That's because you're more gullible than I am. For instance, I don't beliEve that you called off your open marriage. I beliEve your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off. A guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash."
The same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?,That's exactly why you dabble. You're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.
"I'm not that predictable. For example, you're pRobably not expecting me to ask you out for dinner tonight.","No, thanks."
You won't Even consider it?,"I did, just very quickly."
"The truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night. If I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.",Okay. If you bring your wife.
No. That's the point. I need a littleï¿½,You're lying.
I'm not lying.,Then I'm not going.
"Ted, what's wrong? Are youï¿½ what's wrong? Oh, my God. Can somebody help us? Please! Please hurry. Just breathe. Oh, my God.","There's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding. A Tweet, for example."
There's at least 200 ccs of fluid in there.,"Okay, let's say all his symptoms are real. Explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words ""virgin"" or ""Mary."""
ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.,A medication he's not telling us about.
"You really don't trust this guy, do you?","I don't Even trust the ER. Let's rule out infections ourselves. Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure."
We alreadyï¿½,"This time, talk about nuptials while you do it. Check his home for Everything else."
He just moved in with his fiancee three months ago. Toxic exposure could take longer than that to Manifest.,You check his love nest. You two check his swinging bachelor pad.
That somebody else now lives in?,I assume so.
I'm not gay.,"Really? 'Cause it would certainly explain the cold feet. Oh, and the boyfriend."
After three years?,"Well, it's possible. It doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is."
Lung tap turned up mononucleosis. ER doesn't routinely test for it. It explains the PE and can be virtually asymptomatic.,"So we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono? You're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised."
There's been no sex of any kind.,Okay. I'll go test your fiancee for HIV. Is she the curious sort?
"Wait. There may have been some contact, but I'm not gay.","Sodomy, one of the top ten most common Household accidents."
They gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?,To zap the fabulous right out of him.
ECT doesn't cause neural damage.,Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-Man quackery camp. Run an EEG. See if they straightened him or just scrambled him.
Sorry. I completely forgot. My wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00. It's a half-hour drive from here. She won't be back till 10:30. She's taking it with her girlfriend Marly. She hopes to make a tea service. You want to call her?,No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.
No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.,I think you're still seeing the physio. You've got a backup suit in your car. Don't want to be bringing home da stank.
"Okay, yes, you're right, about Everything. But please, House. Don't tell her.","Hi, Rachel."
"Hi, Dr. House. I didn't know you'd be here. Hi, Honey. Got your text, obviously.",I'm just leaving. I've got a ceramics class.
Really?,"I love it. Even Managed to talk Chris into signing up for one. Of course, he's in the beginners' class."
You're in a ceramics class?,"Friday nights, right?"
Friday nights. Sounded like fun.,You should join Chris'.
"You know, I should.","Well, gotta go. Making a tea service."
So what caused the arrest?,"Four ways to stop a heart. Electrical pRoblems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds."
I think that's three things.,"And cheating. Oh, no. Sorry. That's how you break a heart."
I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full so my wife couldn't join me. EP study ruled out shocks.,"Now you just have to find some pottery by Taub. The lamer it looks, the better."
So we'll do an angio to see if it's blocks or bleeds.,You should be a doctor.
I'm gonna check out this new lesbian bar tonight.,Your life is awesome.
I was telling a 33-year-old Woman that she has breast cancer.,"No, you weren't."
How do you know?,"Because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eyes so she could see the concern in yours. Why are you setting me up on dates with my team? Taub asking me out was quirky, but Thirteen doing it is a barking cat."
I'm doing it to help you.,By setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with? And Thirteen?
I've been spending more time with Sam. I know it's been hard on you. I figured if you had some companyï¿½,I don't need your help.
Then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.,I gave him a dollar. How much did you have to pay?
"Nothing. I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company. 100 bucks, Foreman held out for 2. House, I'm worried about you. You could have ended up in jail or worse.",Racking you with guilt. So I do something really stupid and you reward me. Read any parenting Manual. That's not helping me. That's helping you.
"Fine, I did it for me, for my relationship, out of pure self-interest.",Okay.
You'll do it?,For you.
Thank you.,"It's not gonna work, though."
Fainted.,"P.O.T.S. - Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. BP plummets when he's upright, rEverts to normal when he's lying down."
P.O.T.S. can be brought on by a viral or bacterial infection such as mono.,So load him up with fludrocortisone.
So load him up with fludrocortisone.,"You didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?"
Yeah. You did?,As I'm sure your wife did. So we all know they're doing a fourth of July theme. She'll be expecting something star-spangled.
He's got sEvere headaches.,So do I. Should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?
So do I. Should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?,No. What about infection?
"That's what we're thinking. Cerebral infection would explain the headaches, could have caused P.O.T.S. If it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.",I was talking about you. Has the little gent been wearing a tent?
Remind me why that has anything to do with you.,A distracted person makes a distracted professional.
And destroying my marriage will help me focus.,"PRobably. Do a spinal tap. Run the CSF. Still talking about you. But you can do it on the Patient, too, if you want."
"PRobably. Do a spinal tap. Run the CSF. Still talking about you. But you can do it on the Patient, too, if you want.",What about her?
The Bartender?,She's the only one who's not here for fun.
"Trust me, she's not straight.","If your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the Patient till you met his boyfriend?"
The guy walked in with his bride. It took me a while to rotate my dish. It's unbelievable what he's doing to her.,You don't think he loves her?
"He may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.","Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women."
"Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too, but it's hardly the same. To be faithful to his wife, our Patient has to deny his identity. Taub just needs toï¿½",to resist a biological imperative.
It is easier to say no to dessert than to pretend you don't eat.,Says someone who's obviously nEver been on a diet.
"Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.","You're successful, smart, and you attract Everything that moves. If you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice."
You know what? I agree with you. My self-pity's optional. What about yours?,Yeah?
"CSF was negative for infection, and his headaches are worse.",We were just talking about you.
"It's not P.O.T.S., we're back to square one.","Not quite. You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse."
We're maxing him out on morphine.,He sprung a leak. He's losing CSF from the tap site.
We made his headaches worse?,"Just you, actually."
That still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.,"The low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S., not the other way around. Patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF."
It's really not P.O.T.S. We're really back to square one.,"So what's masquerading as a stroke? Voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way."
Sarcoidosis?,Chest x-rays showed no hilar masses. Any luck with the pottery?
Wasn't easy. Bought a suitably cruddy set of fife and drum napkin rings online. Scleroderma?,Skin's fine. A.N.A. was negative. So what did that set you back?
Too much. I got into a bidding war with some lunatic. Histoplasmosis.,"EIA was clear. Hey, could have gone a lot higher than $215."
"What about MELAS? Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes.",NILLAS. No. Idiot. Lactate. LEvels. Are. Stable. We're missing something.
We know how much we can trust his history.,"If history is written by the victor, how do we find out what really happened?"
Talk to the loser.,Call the boyfriend. Let's get them all in the same room.
Or we could question them separately and not torture them.,Or we could get them all in the same room and get the truth.
Oh. Drinks are on me and Foreman tonight.,Can't. Pap smear.
"We don't want to do it either, but Wilson already paid us.",It's gonna suck.
I know.,Where and when?
Nobody wants to follow that.,The night just keeps getting better.
The night just keeps getting better.,To Wilson.
You're lactating.,"If he can't tell his fiancee he's gay, how is he gonna tell her he's pregnant?"
"So something else screwed up his thyroid. Graves, Hashimoto's.",Nope. TSH was normal.
"Didn't say ""cancer."" Prolactinomas can be benign.","Check his prolactin lEvel, then MRI his pituitary."
Sounds like you had fun last night.,You beliEve Chase?
I beliEve Foreman. And they had fun with you. What happened?,I realized that they could be my friends.
You're serious.,And then I sobered up.
You weren't that drunk. You Managed to find your way into your own little bed last night.,I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.
"No, you want to blame this on the booze, but that's easy. Change is hard.",And wisdom is knowing the difference between what you can change... And what you were born with.
Pituitary MRIï¿½,was normal.
was normal.,How are the headaches?
Terrible.,Give me your head.
What the hell?,I know. It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.
"Okay, enough.","How cool is that? You have a Parkari malformation, a narrowing in the base of your skull that can cut off CSF flow. But it wasn't a pRoblem until the ECT at breeder boot camp caused your brain to swell just enough to plug the opening. And when your brain pressed up against your pituitary, it signed you up for La Leche League. You still won't be pitParkng a tent for your lady, but that's just because, you know, she's a lady."
Its orthostatic effect was mimicking P.O.T.S.,"It also does an uncanny Christopher Walken. Unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S., it gets worse. So, as far as that goes, oops."
So how did I get this thing?,"Overbearing mother. Kidding. CM's congenital. Like so Many other things, you were born that way."
I want to marry you. I have to marry you. Nic!,It's Friday night.
I called it off. For real this time.,Frees you up for the next one.
One day at a time. Napkin rings. My way of saying thanks.,For trying to wreck your marriage?
For trying to save it.,And I get napkin rings?
I hired a replacement. For my P.A. She seems great.,Good work.
You too. Your Patient's going home tomorrow.,He doesn't have a home.
You want to grab a bite to eat?,So Wilson got to you too?
No. This is just me.,Lucas?
Working late. I'm buying.,I'm not that hungry.
I just want us to be friends.,Funny. That's the last thing I want us to be.
Funny. That's the last thing I want us to be.,"Okay. ""Therafy"" me."
You're late.,You're fat.
It's unusual.,You know how far the Parking lot is? My leg's been hurting.
"Anything been on your mind lately, any particular stress?",No. PRobably just gonna rain.
Mm-hmm. You like the new Monet reproduction in the waiting room ï¿½ the Water Lilies?,"I was late. I wasn't focusing on the decor, but it sounds appropriately bland and calming."
Stress can also make you absentminded.,I'm not stressed! Beyond the stress induced by you telling me how stressed I am.
Just an ordinary week. Okay. Tell me about it.,I had a Patient.
House. Good. I have a case for you.,Beer?
"Amnesia. She was found jogging in the street, disoriented. She almost got hit by a truck. The MRI showed no abnormalities. No I.D. on her. Just her jogging clothes and her heart rate monitor. We know absolutely nothing about her.","We know she has money. Blaze Outriggers ï¿½ 400 bucks a pair. People who have money don't just disappear. Sooner or later, someone's gonna show up looking for her."
She just ate 15 minutes ago. She keeps forgetting.,You don't eat because you remember it's time to eat. You eat 'cause you're hungry. Her metabolism is in high gear. She is an extreme long-distance runnerï¿½
Why were you in the ER?,"That's your question? You're a psychotherapist. You're hearing about a great amnesia case, and all you're asking me is geography."
Just curious.,I was avoiding Wilson. It's not something you couldn't have seen eight miles away.
I was avoiding Wilson. It's not something you couldn't have seen eight miles away.,Wilson's a processor. I knew there were some things that he'd want to process with me! at length.
Sam's moving in.,"If it's before Friday, your assistant wins the pool."
I was just wondering what your plans were.,Tonight?
In life. Sam likes you!,But she wants me to move out.
"No. I want you to move out. I didn't know things with Sam would happen so quickly. I d""ï¿½I don't want to make a mistake here. I've made a lot of mistakes.","By moving too quickly. Given your usual rate of commitment, I'm surprised you're not already re-divorced."
I could help you find a place.,What's wrong with my old place?
"Nothing. I just thought! You might want to find somewhere new, somewhere!",Where I didn't abuse drugs and hallucinate.
Yes.,I'm fine.
"You're fine? Your best friend is tossing you out, and you're fine?",Why wouldn't I be?
You're not feeling a little! betrayed and angry? Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo specifically so that you could move in with him. It wasn't that long ago. You don't feel a little! jerked around?,He couldn't foresee Sam coming back into his life.
"That's a very rational defense of your friend. And, uh, I'm not buying it.",Based on what?
"Based on the fact that you were late, and you didn't notice the pictures in the outer office.",Those aren't symptoms.
"They are to me. And here's another one. You took the case. Hmm? No negotiating, no bargaining. No clinic hours changed hands. Were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?",Case was interesting.
It's not organic. It's not mysterious. Most likely some psychologically traumatic Event occurred that made the Patient's brain choose to forget Everything.,Or not.
Or not.,Here. Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter.
Do I need to know this?,"Fine. I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. Chase ""ï¿½ MS, Taub ""ï¿½ physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out."
Good luck with that.,Her heart rate monitor has a serial number. The distributor can match the number to the store that sold it. She's a serious athlete. She might have been there often enough to be remembered.
Did he really say that?,Subtextually.
Long shot.,"Even if the store clerk doesn't know who she is, the store's pRobably close to where she lives. Just seeing those surroundings might sPark a memory."
You want us to take her there?,No. I'll take her.
"Really? Uh, it's unusual for you to spend time with a Patient, isn't it?","Patients are boring! As people. This one I'm sure was no exception, but her situation was interesting. Besides, I was still avoiding Wilson. And no better way to avoid than leaving the hospital."
Maybe. Or were you avoiding going home? There's a reason they tell addicts to stay away from old geography.,I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!
I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home!,Before I came into work that day. I went straight there from Wilson's.
Alvie? Juan Alvarez ï¿½ you let him stay at your place?,Not exactly.
"I was beginning to wonder if you were Ever gonna show up. Su casa, mi casa. Casa!",Why are you here?
"When I left Mayfield, I went back to the old neighborhood. You know, you shouldn't leave the bathroom window unlocked.","Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson. Why are you here?"
"Like I said, when I went back to the neighborhood, I found out immigration was looking for me. So I decided to visit my old buddy House!",And turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.
"Juan Alvarez is no freeloader. I do my part, earn my keep. The first week I made your dinner, but you nEver showed up. The second week I organized your stuff.",My stuff?
"But still, you nEver showed up. So this week, since I'm a real good painter, I decided toï¿½",Coffee table ï¿½ where'd you put it? In the bedroom?
"The paint's not cheap, House. It's a custom color. It's a mix of titanium, yellow, and ochre. Ochre ï¿½ I don't Even like that stuff. It's like a fruit. It's got hair on it. But they say it's a vegetableï¿½",You sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?
I had to sell some other things too.,Get out.
"No, papa, just give the color a chance.","Look, I'm going to work now. And when I come back, the walls will be a less exciting color, and you will be gone."
"So Wilson threw you out, and you threw Alvie out ï¿½ just, uh, another week?","Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave. I took my motorcycle to work that day. When I went home to get my car, he was painting the ceiling magenta. So I brought him with me to protect the apartment."
Why?,To protect the apartment. Whoa. Deja vu.
"Tossing him out or, uh, sending him to the movies or, uh, locking him in the bathroom would also minimize Alvie's destructive force. But you chose his company deliberately. Why?","Obviously because he's a Wilson substitute. You can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood."
"I'm not suggesting Alvie's a substitute, but he would make a great distraction.",From what?
Maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift. That's why no one recognized her.,"Shut up, Alvie. Anything familiar! Church, grocery store?"
"It's okay, Ms. X. Maybe she's nEver been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.","You know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, right? Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?"
I had a birth certifiCate. I lost it.,So get a new one.
"I tried that, House. But the town hall had burned down when I was a kid, destroyed the records.",There's only one copy?
They tried to make me fill out a whole bunch of forms before they'd give it to me. I decided it would be quicker and easier to do it myself.,How'd that go?
What if nothing Ever looks familiar?,"Then someone will show up ï¿½ a spouse, a friend ï¿½ to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling. They always do."
I don't know who that is! But I miss him.,What did they say at the hearing?
I didn't go. I lied once.,"Your mother is Puerto Rican, therefore, you are Puerto Rican. All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentationï¿½"
"People like that don't listen to people like me. Doughnuts! Hey, House, let's get doughnuts!","Alvie, the hearingï¿½"
"Everyone loves doughnuts ï¿½ glazed, crullers, elephant ears, Even doughnut holes. Much better than the sporting goods store. I bet Mrs. X went there all the time.",We're not hereï¿½ And then I realized! You make a good point.
"Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled? You want the usual, right?","Your old friend, the fried carbohydrate. She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?"
Sandy! Or Shelley. I don't know. The guy she's with called her that once. I just work here.,Do you know where they live?
"The police said it was too soon to do anything, so I started calling hospitals on my own. Princeton Plainsboro wasn't Even on my list. You really think something around here could have made her sick?","Here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed. Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?"
That doesn't sound like me.,Do you have any idea what would sound like you?
So what were you thinking during all this?,"That it was a strange position to be in. At that moment, she was more comfortable with me than with her husband. And he was picking up on it."
What about you?,What about me how?
"Well, there was a sort of, um, artificial intimacy between you? She had been dependent on you. Uh, did you find that attractive on some lEvel? Disturbing?",Those are my two choices? None of the above. She was just a Patient. She was interesting.
"You know, she just won a settlement for some families whose housing dEvelopment was built on an old methane field.",Toxic exposure to methane could explain this.
"All right, it's nothing personal. Bet she didn't think you were her type back when you first met either.","We'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment."
Oh! I'm all right.,What happened?
Her pants are wet.,Urinary incontinence. She's having complex partial seizures. This isn't methane. And you can leave the bucket. We need to get her toï¿½
Seizures? This is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.,I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues? You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?
"You're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it. First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past.",Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe he's obsessed with my past.
"And""ï¿½and now you're talking about a seizure disorder?",Which is also not a toxin.
"But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain. Wh""ï¿½why do you see your past as such a threat?","Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back."
"Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.",There's a ding mark.
It's a piece of junk. It was dinged when it came in.,"Sure, the""ï¿½the cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three Parkps. This fourth one's new."
That should be it.,You said you pawned five books. There's only four.
That's all there is.,"Where's ""Approach to the Acute Abdomen""ï¿½?"
Sold it.,To?
"I can't tell you. It's a law, and should be. Crazy bastards like you try to hunt down their stuff.",How much for the pile?
$500.,You said it was junk.
Why is it so important that you get your stuff back?,Unlike the rest of huManity! Who's okay when their belongings are taken. Everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.
Everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.,I like my stuff. I hate it when Wilson moves itï¿½
Oh!,This is not about Wilson! Say it.
I wasn't gonna say anything.,"31, 31! Hike!"
First down!,"One more, you get a touchdown."
Whoo!,Hike!
"Huh! House, you can't run for the touchdown.",And! hike!
"Wait, wait, wait. Wait. You seriously thought you were gonna tell me that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?","Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him. Wilson noticed that I didn't come to my office all day. He came to find me, wanted to make sure I'm okay ï¿½ boring, boring, boring."
"House, House, stop! Stop, stop, stop.",You okay?
Yeah. It was my mother's. She died when I was four. It's all I have left.,"That's very sad, Alvie. Listen, I set up an immigration hearing."
"Um, interesting. You present yourself as, uh, not giving a damn about other people's emotions, but your actions indiCate otherwise. You dismiss Alvie's story about his mother, but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.",I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.
I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.,Yeah.
We've kept the Patient up for 12 hours now. No hint of seizure-like activity. We should shut this down.,"Try a stRobe light, add more stress."
"Apparently, without her memory, the Patient's personality has returned to what you might call its ""natural state.""ï¿½",Seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college. Her brother died in a car accident. She decided to make her life mean something. Went to law school. Now that's all gone.
The thing that caused the change is gone! So the change itself is gone.,Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you. Bet you got a theory already. What is it?
It's not relevant.,What is it?
Why do you care about my theory?,"I think he just! bores her. She's at an earlier stage of dEvelopment. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep."
"If he just bored her, she'd hide it to be polite. Their pRoblem is synchronicity. Just like you and me, House, they're not on the same page. He talks to her like someone he shares history with. But from her point of view, he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her. Of course she doesn't like him. He's not helping. He can feel he's losing his wife, and it makes him come on stronger.",He almost did lose his wife.
And the D.I. came from damage to the hypothalamus.,"Hypothalamus here, hence the D.I. and incontinence. The Amygdala here, hence the global amnesia. And the motor cortex ï¿½that's the foot paralysis. What do they all have in common?"
"Okay, now you're just doing this to mess with me. What possible relevance does this differential have to your pRoblems?",It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis. I convinced the team to cut out part of this Woman's brain. That's not interesting to you?
No.,Not Even if it's the Amygdala? She'll lose all her long-term memory.
"Well, this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past. The case is irrelevant. You just found it, uh! interesting.",Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?
"Nowhere! is that in the Manual. Look, you""ï¿½you've been in therapy for a year. You know when I ask you to talk about anything, I mean anything that affects you ï¿½what upset you, what made you mad or reliEved or joyful. You want me to beliEve that this case means nothing? Then, um! why should I listen to it?",Are you charging me for this time?
Yes.,This is ridiculous.
What's that? On the back of your arm?,It's just a bruise. And I fell.
You remember falling?,No. I was drunk! Hence the balance issues.
"Well, it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.",I said something that someone objected to.
"Well, if you don't remember, then how can youï¿½","It's usually the way it is when someone hits me. People who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks."
"You got drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember, and you've been insisting that Everything's fine? W""ï¿½why""ï¿½why go out and get blind drunk? Were you looking for a fight?",I don't know.
What have you screwed up?,What?
"You say that when you've been hit in the past, it's because you provoked it with something that you said, which means you're well aware of the risks. So on some lEvel, you were in that bar looking for someone to hurt you. Logically, people punish themselves for something they did or something they didn't do. So what! did you screw up?","I don't know. Okay, there may be a pRoblem."
I told him your book was contaminated with Anthrax spores. Then I gave him $300. The address of the buyer. Maybe I was hasty in asking you to move out. Why don't you stay with me and Sam for a little while? There's no need to hurry things.,What prompted this?
"Look, the whole idea was that after Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own. I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me thanï¿½","God's sake, Wilson. You really span the chasm from wishy to washy. If you're gonna be an ass, be an ass. Stick with it."
"Why were you being so hard on the guy, when he was being conciliatory?",Come on. Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.
How do you know that? How do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?,"Two reasons ï¿½ first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam. He's been thinking about asking me to leave for a while. Finally he does it and immediately turns around and changes his mind? No. He talked to somebody."
Maybe it was Sam.,"Yeah, that's a possibility."
"Okay, um! Not Sam. Uh, that still doesn't answer why Cuddy.","Because they've been talking about me. She called me to check on the Patient, which she nEver does without a reason. I asked why, and she said!"
"She's a barracuda attorney, House. These are the kind of Patients we like to keep happy.",Right now the Patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.
"Yeah, but when she gets that memory back, which we are trying to make happen, she'll be able to spell lawsuit. I'm just touParkng base.",TouParkng base. Wilson used exactly the same phrase. Colluding about me is their favorite pastime.
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.,"Yeah, he is."
What's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?,"Your version needed to be ended, 'cause it's crap. It's all sweetness and light and! faith that I'm gonna choose the right path. Yeah, that sounds like Wilson."
I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours. I know Wilson's your friend. So he could be wondering if he did right by you. And I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless he was convinced you could handle life on your own.,And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House pRoblem.
So there's truth in both versions. But you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable. So! Why are you and Wilson! friends? Do you think this friendship is the best you can do?,Wilson is not a consolation prize.
"There! You're defending him. And a minute ago, he was skulking around in the background like some sort of Manipulative Iago.",He's my friend.
So what do you value in him?,"I can say whatEver I want to him, and he'll nEver leave."
"He's sort of leaving. At least, he won't be around as much! because he's putting Sam first.","For now. After the divorce, he'll pRobably ask me to move in again. I take the long view."
You say that to Wilson?,Are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hit you.
"Uh, maybe you've been right from the beginning. Maybe this isn't about Wilson.",You say that now that I finally agree with you? Do you just argue the opposite of whatEver I say?
"I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't, uh, bother you, uh, but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship. You'd have to do something major to screw it up. Um, what""ï¿½what else have you been involved in this week? What would you want to punish yourself for?","I told you, I don't know."
"Okay, um, let's approach it from a different angle. Have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?","Well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week."
Why wouldn't she? Of course she's willing to risk losing her memories perManently. She has no idea how important those memories are. Does she Even know what risk is? She's nEver lost anything.,"Without the surgery, she'll lose Everything. The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain."
"Well, there has to be another way. Please. I'm speaking for my wife, the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here and can't defend herself. Dr. House, are you listening?","Well, you can stop arguing, 'cause it doesn't matter anymore. Look at the variability in the heart rate. The S.E. has spread into the brain stem."
No. We can't cut the brain stem.,"This thing's moving too quickly. Surgery's no longer an option, which I guess means you've won. Congratulations. Put in a pacer and start her on chemo and radiation. It won't cure her, but it'll buy a couple weeks so she can find out who she is before she dies."
That was pretty rough Do you always break the news to your Patients that way? Or were you short-handing it for me?,Husband was being an idiot.
"Well, he was asking for it. But, um, to punish him you have to punish the wife too. Why""ï¿½why did he make you so angry, Hmm? Because he didn't want to cooperate with you?",He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage. People's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.
Your leg hurt?,It's all right.
Okay. Anyone else you pissed off?,50 bucks for the book.
Forget it.,You paid $25. That's 100% return.
"That's what I paid. But it's a rare surgical text, nearly 100 years old ï¿½ plates in mint condition. That book's worth sEveral thousand dollars.","$2,000. I'll write you a check."
"Yo, House, you want to stop by the library? 'Cause I got a book to return. Ta-ka-plow!",Anyone see you?
I didn't know there was a section of the brain just for hope.,"It's very, very tiny."
We're trying to stabilize her heart. She's still tachy and hypotensive.,"Brain, heart, and rapidly progressing."
"Her extreme exercise suppresses her immune system, allows the infection to smolder.",Or allows an old infection to reactivate it ï¿½ TB. Start her on a multidrug regimen.
A gentle reminder ï¿½ the use of cell phones is prohibited.,Give her the first dose directly into the lungs in the O.R.
Before the less gentle arrest for contempt.,Put her in an isolation room with U.V. light. And get yourselves tested. You've all been exposed.
You are?,I am Mr. Alvarez's doctor.
My mother's DNA was still on that cross?,It could be.
You faked it? It wasn't just me. You lied to them too!,I'm better at it than you are.
May need to tube her. Grab some I.V. furosemide.,"Wait, wait."
We need to get her on a vent.,There's something on her ankle.
"""Eddie would go."" It's a surfing phrase. Must be from her earlier life.","She tried to get it removed, but they only took off the top layers of skin. The ink is still in the deeper layers. Set off an allergic reaction. She was fine until she started the long-distance running. The ultra-marathoning modified her immune system, set off the allergic reaction. We did a full thickness skin graft, and she'll be okay."
So you were right! in the end. It was her past. Did she get her memory back?,Not yet.
Will she?,No way to know.
He's treating her as though they just met. He's courting her. Whose idea was that? He was doing the opposite of Everything he should. Suddenly he's changed.,Taub thought it mightï¿½
"That was your idea. And you asked me what I thought was going on between them. It's their relationship that's on your mind. That's why you've been thinking about this case ï¿½ relationships. Lost one with Wilson, gained one with Alvie.",Not exactly.
Not exactly.,Alvie?
You gonna tell me what the note said?,Alvie was very grateful that I'd gotten him out of trouble. It allowed him to go stay with his cousin in Phoenix without worrying about immigration looking for him there.
You didn't think he was gonna stay forEver.,No.
What happened next?,Nothing happened next.
Nothing happened next.,That's all I got.
Relationships.,BergMan. What do you want me to say?
I don't know. You're the one who set the theme ï¿½ something about relationships made you go out and provoke a fight. Wilson and Sam have a relationship. You're not thrilled about it.,"They're happy. Why should I screw that up? Everyone's happy. Everyone's moving in together ï¿½ Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas. Even Alvie'sï¿½"
Cuddy and Lucas are moving in together? You didn't mention that.,They talked about moving in together before. It's not big news.
"Cuddy! Cuddy. ""Approach to the Acute Abdomen""ï¿½! Written by Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D. Any relation to your Cuddy?",Her great-grandfather. I've had it for years! Always meant to give it to her for a special occasion.
Like her! Housewarming?,It's just a gift.
"A Woman you care about is taking one step further away from you and closer to someone else? I""ï¿½I think I can safely say yes, it's significant if you don't mention it. You were willing to punish the husband of your Patient because you identified with him. He was also losing someone he loved.","I'm not gonna go out and get hammered because a Woman I'm not Even with is moving in with someone. That'd be pathetic. To hell with this. When I first came to you, I told you that I wanted to be happy, and I followed your advice. And instead, I'm just miserable. How is this working for me?"
It takes time.,"For a year, I've done Everything you've asked, and Everybody else is happy. I run on my treadmill. You just sit there and watch. You're a faith healer. You take advantage of people who want to beliEve. But there's nothing in your bag of tricks."
House!,"WhatEver the answer is, you don't have it."
A crane collapsed in downtown Trenton.,Don't care.
My great-grandfather.,"No, it's just a book he wrote. Open it up."
"Seriously, you're giving this to us?",It's a big step you're taking. I wanted to congratulate you. I understand that's the adult thing to do.
How did you know?,I've known for a while. The fact that you decided to cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler. Unless my intel is wrong.
I've known for a while. The fact that you decided to cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler. Unless my intel is wrong.,Trouble in paradise?
We have to get to Trenton.,Can you hear me?
Hmm?,That sound like a yes?
"Sir, we have to get you to the O.R. You have a bad wound, but we're gonna pack it and transport you as fast as we can.",Skull fracture. Glasgow coma score of 11. She's immediate.
Skull fracture. Glasgow coma score of 11. She's immediate.,Move on. This guy's dead.
His wounds aren't soï¿½,Forget the wound. Look at his toes. Atherosclerotic emboli. He'll nEver survive the surgery.
Maybe his shoes were too tight.,"It's not the shoes. Skin shows smoker's facies. He's not gonna make it till morning. He'll just take up an ambulance ride, surgeon's time, and an ICU bed."
"Crane operator. Made it through amazingly well. Lucid and responsive. Stable fracture, right humerus. Haven't gotten to his lower half yet.",Tell me when something hurts.
"I fell asleep, killed all those people.","Something other than your conscience. Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?"
"Something other than your conscience. Is that a pill in your pocket, or are you just happy to have a tiny pill-shaped penis?",Caffeine pills. You fell asleep taking these?
I drank two cups of coffee too.,Is that normal for you?
"No, I hate coffee. I'm working on no sleep. My daughter has the flu.","This much caffeine for a coffee virgin. There's no way he fell asleep. He passed out. Which means a neurological disorder caused the crash, not fatigue. Hey. We're taking the crane operator back to Princeton."
They said he was barely hurt ï¿½ he can wait.,Steal an ambulance. And call the team. Tell 'em we got a case.
House. No! I need you here.,Well he needs me there. And he moans louder than you do.
Having fun down there?,"Lots! Every time Cuddy leans over a Patient, it's another opportunity for a down blouse nip slip. What's going on between her and Lucas?"
Besides them moving in together? That's not enough for you?,"I gave her the Housewarming gift earlier. And she paused for a split second, like she was hiding something."
It's pRobably her moral revulsion at Housewarming gifts.,Or maybe she didn't want to accept a gift for something she wasn't gonna do.
What was that? You okay?,Yeah. Vending maParkne collapsed.
Yeah. Vending maParkne collapsed.,She still using your ex-wife as a realtor?
As far as I know.,"Well, know a little farther, will you? Look into it."
"Well, know a little farther, will you? Look into it.",Hey! There's somebody down here!
I'm not getting anything.,I heard something ï¿½ there's gotta be a void down there.
There's a million voids down there. It was the Parking garage. But equipment hasn't picked up any movement. Dogs haven't picked up any scent.,There's smashed cars down there. The gasoline throw off their scent?
"Look, we gotta get back to work, okay? We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.",Anybody hear me? Hey! Anybody hear me?
Anybody hear me? Hey! Anybody hear me?,Aah! Oh...
Help me.,What's your name?
Please...my husband's gift. I was supposed to pick it up at the framers. It's on Elm.,"Well, you should have told me earlier. I could have picked it up on the way. What's your name?"
It's a picture from our Tortola trip. For his birthday.,I'm not asking your name because I wanna become friends. I'm trying to gauge your mental state.
Hanna.,"Okay, that's a start. What day of the week is it?"
Tuesday.,Better still.
What happened?,"You know that giant construction crane next door? It's kind of on top of you right now. Okay, I'm gonna try to pull you out."
Ow! My leg! Oh! Oh! Oh!,"Okay, okay."
"Okay, okay.",Whew! I'm gonna need to get help.
"No, stay! Someone else will come.",No one knows I'm down here.
Please! Stay with me. Don't leave me in the dark.,I'll be right back.
He's still in the ER House. We haven't had time to start a differential.,Perfect! Let's start right now. Put me on speaker. What causes syncope?
Your guy's stable. The two dozen other Patientsï¿½,Who don't need to be diagnosed. They just need to be bandaged. What causes syncope?
"Or you're wrong, and he just fell asleep.",How's he gonna sleep with 50 cups of coffee going through his veins?
Were you nEver a medical resident?,"I hear ten, elEven, and twelve. Where's Thirteen?"
She's not here. And the answer to your next question is no. I don't know,Do you have the answer to my question after that? Space-occupying lesion in his brain is most likely. MRI will prove I'm right.
Or it'll just prove he suffered head trauma from the crash.,Which we'd wanna find anyway. Two birds with one scan. Do it.
Having trouble finding a vein for Hanna's IV.,She getting weaker? Paler?
"No, no. She's stable.","That means her blood loss in minimal. Buys us some time. Get the IV into her tibia. It's almost hollow, feeds into the venous system. Which, they obviously don't teach you in EMT school."
"That means her blood loss in minimal. Buys us some time. Get the IV into her tibia. It's almost hollow, feeds into the venous system. Which, they obviously don't teach you in EMT school.",Told ya I'd be back.
Told ya I'd be back.,Heard you might be thirsty.
Ahhh...,I assume that bodes well for the rescue?
What's your name?,You testing my mental state?
I'm gonna be stuck down here for a while. I'd like somebody to talk to.,"Look, the guy who just left is the one who's gonna be holding your hand through all this. You talk to him."
"Look, the guy who just left is the one who's gonna be holding your hand through all this. You talk to him.",Little pinch.
Aah! Oh! Ow!,Okay. Big pinch.
I gotta call my husband. Can I use your phone?,"Uh, no bars down here. L'chaim."
Where are you going?,Don't worry. Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.
Don't worry. Fire marshal Bill will be back soon.,So I hope I didn't weird you out giving you that gift.
Can we talk about this later?,"Of course. Is now later? Maybe things aren't going so well with Lucas. If so, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to step into anything."
Thank you.,So why the weirdness?
"Can you help? When I opened it, I didn't think it was a Housewarming gift. I thought it was an engagement present. It just happened last night.",No wonder you wanna hide this from me... Since I'm such a deliCate flower.
I didn't know what to say. And I've been slightly distracted.,"That might make sense, 'cept you're not wearing the ring. So...You are hiding it, which begs the questionï¿½"
Please listen to me. You've been down here almost two hours. By the time they clear away the rubbleï¿½,We are not cutting off her leg. You don't have to rush through this to make his job easier.
"Dying muscles release poisons. We free your leg, the poisons rush back into your system. It could stop your heart.",So could cheeseburgers. Let's get your lazy friends to start moving that pile. She's got two more hours before crush syndrome could possibly set in.
"It's not just crush syndrome you gotta worry about, okay? There's gas leaks. There's fire. We can nEver rule out secondary collapses, no matter how much we shore this thing up.","You think chopping off someone's limb inside a pile of dirty rocks is safe? Sepsis, fat embolism, a hemorrhage."
"Thank you, doctor?",House. You don't need to thank me. It just makes sense.
Just promise me you won't let them cut off my leg.,I promise. Does that make you feel better?
Your phone is working down here.,Switched carriers. Better rollover minutes. Talk.
"MRI was clean, but afterwards, he started bleeding out of his eyes and nose.",So there was something wrong before the collapse.
Unless it's just conjunctive coagulopathy from the trauma.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah ï¿½ you don't think he was sick before. We get it! You're wrong."
Sorry I'm late.,Where were you?
"The infection causes neurological symptoms, goes systemic, and D.I.C. causes the bleed.",Good theory. Except for the part that there's no fEver. Get an X-ray venogram. See if you can find a reason for your existence. Also look for venous sinus thrombosis.
Would have seen it on the MRI.,Not if you were too busy not looking for it.
We should X-ray for a facial fracture first. This could all be simple trauma.,Just do what I tell you. Be back in ten minutes.
You're leaving?,There's a dozen people here who can save you. I'm apparently the only one who can save this other guy.
Hanna's freaking out. She's having a panic attack. She can't breathe. She's gonna rip out all her IVs.,So calm her down.
She wants you.,I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.
You only came back because I freaked out. Right?,Not at all. I just realized how... big and scary the world is and how cozy and safe this little place is.
Thank you. I'm sorry I needed you.,Here. Call your husband.
Charlie? I'm here in... They called you? They're helping me. Are you coming? I don't know how this could happen. It's your birthday. I'm so sorry.,"See? This is why I lied about the phone. Your BP is spiking, so you're bleeding faster from your leg wound. I'm gonna have less time to save it. Hang up."
"Okay. Okay, they're telling me I have to go.",That was stupid of me.
It was nice.,I don't see that as a contradiction.
"He was already on his way. He was in Baltimore, and they all saw it on the news. How Many people were hurt?",What did I tell you about not raising your blood pressure?
Can I ask what's wrong with your leg?,Crane fell on it. Small world.
You could have just said no.,I'll remember that for my next huMan contact.
Would you pray with me?,No. I'm not in the habit of encouraging my Patients' superstitions.
How is that a habit? You plan on getting trapped under a building again?,I don't beliEve in God.
"I always thought... If I did the right thing, if I treated people right, then good things would happen to me. You think that's how it works?",I didn't use to. Then recently I tried... Now I don't know.
You think we can be friends when I get outta here?,Yeah. We'll catch a ball game or... group sex show or something.
Put the cribbing in there.,"Okay, now when the beam starts lifting, you're gonna feel pain. It's gonna be like your foot's gone to sleep times a billion. You'll notice that I'm waiting till now to tell you."
I'm feeling the pain already.,That's good. That means the pressure's coming off. Much closer to getting out of here.
Aah!,Come on. Pull her out.
Come on. Pull her out.,Come on!
Aahhh!,Hanna! Hanna! What the hell happened?
Lift this up.,"One, two, threeï¿½"
"One, two, threeï¿½",Kit. Gimme the kit.
All right.,"No breath sounds on the left side. Tension pneumothorax. Okay, Hanna."
Hey. You better get back up top and make sure you didn't nick an artery.,I'm gonna have to go.
You're lucky this isn't worse.,You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being who wasn't down there.
You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being who wasn't down there.,What did the venogram say?
He didn't say his neck was sore.,That's 'cause Everything's sore. He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete. Do an LP.
We also have to consider other infections.,So you're suggesting we do an LP.
I guess I am.,Genius.
Then we have to amputate.,No.
It's been four hours already. It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.,Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium. If we remove potassiumï¿½
We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.,But not with glucose and Insulin. We have glucose in the kit. There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.
You wanna dose the insulin here in a non-hospital setting? That is insane! It's not worth it.,"Really? 'Cause I think I'm the only one here who knows what a leg is worth. And fortunately, you're not the one in charge ï¿½ he is. And he knows that I'd testify against him if Hanna sues for cutting off a leg without exhausting Every option."
"I know you're angry, but please don't put her life at risk just to get back at me.",Really? Wow. So this is all about you now.
You took her side against me right after you heard about my engagement.,Yeah. That must be it. It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.
I don't love you. So just... accept it and move on with your life instead of making Everyone miserable.,That's great. A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a Man-Parkld.
Screw you. I'm sick of making excuses for you. I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you and make their own lives worse while they try to keep you from collapsing. I'm done.,Fantastic. Just stay away from my Patient.
Dr. House. Tell her.,Hanna... We have to amputate your leg.
No. You said... that there was time.,There was. And it's run out.
No.,"You asked me how I'd hurt my leg. I had a blood clot, and the muscle was dying. And I had all these doctors telling me I should amputate, and I said no, and they did this... very risky operation. I almost died."
But you saved your leg.,I wish I hadn't.
I wish I hadn't.,"They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist, and they left me with this, mutilated, useless thing. I'm in pain... Every day. It changed me. Made me a harder person, a worse person. And now... Now I'm alone. You don't want to be like me. You've got a husband who loves you. You have friends. You can start a family. You have a life. And this... This is just a leg."
Okay.,I got it.
I got it.,I can't put you out. It could depress your respiration too much. This should take away some of the pain.
Will it be quick?,"I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin, muscle, and fat. That should go pretty fast. Then I'll switch over to the electric saw when I get to the bone. It's two bones... About as thick as a broomstick. Takes about as long to get through. I'm gonna cut as close to the concrete, as I can, save as much of your limb as possible. Then the orthopedic surgeons back at the hospital will clean you up, have you fitted for a prosthetic. You'll be running circles around me in no time."
How bad will it hurt?,Like nothing you've Ever felt before.
I love you.,What?
"He's fallen into a coma. LP was clean, but...",What are his vitals?
"Excuse me, Officer.","What do you mean, Officer? How long has there been a cop there?"
I don't know. Ten minutes. He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.,Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?
He was claustrophobic right before the bleed and before the fEver. We told him that he pRobably did fall asleep.,Was his BP spiking?
But that didn't cause his first symptom.,"Yeah, it did. All the caffeine. We thought the pRoblem was in his toilet ï¿½ by that, of course, I mean his head. Which distracted us from the fact that it could have been just a clog in his sewer pipe, and by that, of course, I mean his spinal cord. And blah, blah, blah, blah. You get the idea."
An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine. That's why we missed it. He's been sitting ten hours a day. Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.,Run a CTï¿½
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.,"Breath sounds bilaterally. It's not another pneumothorax. Neck vein's flat. There's no tamponade. Damn it, I went in too high. Hanna, you've got a clot in your lung. I'm gonna fix this. IV streptokinase."
What's happening. What's going on?,Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot. This is a blood thinner.
Is she gonna be all right?,It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.
It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,It's not busting the clot.
What?,It's not a clot. It's a fat embolism. From the amputation.
You can't blame yourself for her death. This wasn't your fault.,That's the point! I did Everything right. She died anyway. Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?
You shouldn't be alone right now. You're bleeding.,I'm gonna give you a task as an employee. Get out of my way.
Obviously not.,You going to leap across the room and grab them out of my hand?
No. It's your choice if you want to go back on drugs.,"Okay. Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside."
You need to re-bandage your shoulder.,Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?
No.,You here to yell at me again?
No.,"Well, I'm running out of ideas."
Lucas...,"Oh, great. You're feeling uncomfortable again. PRobably means you just got back from some quickie wedding in Vegas or you're already pregnant."
I ended it.,What?
"I'm stuck, House. I keep wanting to move forward. I keep wanting to move on, and I can't. I mean, my new House, with my new fiancï¿½, and all I can think about is you. I just need to know if you and I can work.",You think I can fix myself?
I don't know.,'Cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.
I know. I love you. I wish I didn't. But I can't help it.,How do I know I'm not hallucinating?
Did you take the Vicodin?,Nope.
Then I think we're okay.,Yeah.
She loves her brother. She's thinking selflessly. How is that at allï¿½,Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.
"Miss Tanner. Miss Tanner. Oh, dear God.","Which of these says ""I want to sleep with you"" more? Penguin or beaver? Beaver, beaver, beaver. You're right, it's too high school."
What did you do to piss Cuddy off?,I can't be roMantic?
"House, you're stealing from a Woman in a coma.",We're fine. NEver seen her happier.
Yeah? How about you?,I'm... worried.
Because she's happy?,"No, because I am."
"House, that'sï¿½",Ironic? Weird? Crazy?
I was going to say normal.,"For now. We're in the Honeymoon period. Our brains are flooded with endorphins. Once she snaps out of it, where does that leave us?"
In an adult relationship.,Name one thing that Cuddy and I have in common besides work.
There's... You're both... Wait.,"Exactly. Long-term relationships are based on compatibility, and right now we only have sex."
"House, you don't actually think she'd dump you because you, what, don't do yoga? Listen to the B-52s?","Not right away. We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me. With possible goodbye sex."
"So, instead of enjoying the Honeymoon phase, you've decided to skip it entirely.",I need to find something that we both like doing besides each other.
Right. Or you could just talk to her about it.,"No, then she'll start pretending to like things that she really doesn't just to make me feel better, which will make her feel Even worse, which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her, and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me. At least with my plan I get my one a day with iron till the bitter end. Is there a reason why you're following me?"
There's nothing wrong with me. My maid just overreacted.,Great. This won't take long then.
I fainted.,"Huge Jack Cannon fan, by the way. Love your books."
Really? My fans tend to be overly-annoying teenaged girls.,"I know. All they care about is who's hotter, Jack or Deacon. Like Sarah can't love both of them. I may belong to one or two online fan clubs. How's the new book coming along?"
I don't talk about my work.,'Kay. How about nodding your head to a few yes/no questions?
"But I'll make you a deal. You finish this exam quickly, and I'll answer one question.",About anything?
"Anything. Who was Jack's real father, who kidnapped his Uncle...","Deal. I will have to go with, why'd you try to kill yourself? Burn on the side of your face is caused by gunpowder, so, change your mind at the last second, or you just a lousy shot?"
I'm out of here.,Can't. We had a deal.
Try and stop me.,"Okay. This Woman is on a 72-hour psyParkatric hold. If she tries to run, shoot her. With a sedative, if that's more convenient."
You called us back to work because a lady might have had a seizure.,A seizure while trying to commit suicide.
So send her for a psych eval. What's that got to do with us?,What is the matter with you people? We're talking about a huMan being who's suffering.
What is the matter with you people? We're talking about a huMan being who's suffering.,"You're right. That's not enough. She is also the writer of Jack Cannon: Boy Detective, beloved by millions around the world."
By girls between 10 and 14.,"Look, the point is if she kills herself, millions of fans of all ages and genders will be very disappointed."
So we're taking this case 'cause you're a fan?,"No, that would be crazy and unprofessional. You're taking this case 'cause I said so. You and Taub do a full workup. Observe her overnight. See if she has another seizure. You can go."
Why does he get the night off?,"Because he brought a ""smokin'""ï¿½ hot babe."
I have plans with my wife.,"Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life. And you obviously don't have one."
"Yeah, nice try, but you hate your personal life. And you obviously don't have one.","Hey. I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers."
"Hey. I'd stay myself, but I just bought the flowers.","Reservation for Dominica's isn't till 8:00, so we got plenty of time."
We need to pick something up from a haunted House?,This is a Gothic Revival masterpiece. I hope one day to live in a House like this.
Your friend's a writer?,One of the best. She wants me to read her latest Manuscript.
Alice Tanner. Why does that name sound familiar?,I gave you a couple of her books a few years ago.
No. She's the Woman you put on the psych hold. This isn't a date. We're on a case.,Ever hear of multitasking?
Did you steal her keys?,"Think I'd take the Dean of Medicine on a ""B""ï¿½ and ""E""ï¿½"
How did you get in here?,"Well, I guess you have your answer."
"House, Christina has agreed to not call the police.",She's pRobably illegal. Same reason she didn't report the suicide attempt.
"I call 911. But when Miss Tanner woke up, she say she will fire me if I say anything about the gun.","And if she whacks herself, what happens to your job?"
"I think she's a very depressed person. NEver goes out, doesn't have friends. She has all this money, but all she does is write.",I need to see her latest Manuscript.
Yes. Her back and her hands hurt a lot.,A writer with back and hand pain. That's very helpful. Let's go.
Sometimes I hear her cry at night. When she thinks nobody's listening. I should have done something.,True.
What are you doing?,"Before there were hard drives, there were..."
"Before there were hard drives, there were...",How Many of these does she eat a day?
You. What do you want?,You wet the bed. Just not sure how yet.
Mercury poisoning?,"Explains the seizures, hand and back pain, also the depression."
She only asked for a Woman to waste time. She's cooperating just enough to get through the psych hold.,Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy. Confirm with another urine test. Okay. I'll go talk to Cuddy. Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress too.
Put some lipstick on Chase and start chelation therapy. Confirm with another urine test. Okay. I'll go talk to Cuddy. Maybe she'll let us borrow a dress too.,"Ahe""ï¿½ahem."
This would be me ignoring you. What if we got arrested last night? And whatEver happened to keeping our professional and personal lives separate?,I'm not the one talking about our relationship at work.
What's behind your back?,Peace penguin.
What room should I return it to?,243. I need some help with Alice Tanner. She wants a vagina.
I'm pretty attached to mine. I told you to hire a temporary replacement for Thirteen two weeks ago.,I've been busy.
Doing what?,You. So you'll talk her out of it?
You'll hire a Woman doctor?,You think we just sit around talking sports and belParkng and farting when the Parkcks aren't around? By when?
Next week.,Next week it is.
What's that?,It's the new Jack Cannon novel. Suggestions?
Yeah. Stop. It can't be done.,People wonder why you've nEver cured cancer.
Did you get this before or after your date with Cuddy?,"Eh, pRobably would have been a wiser choice."
"Huh. This is actually good, House. She's committing crimes. What does that tell you?",I'm a horrible influence.
"True. A horrible influence she's reaParkng out to. She's looking for ways to connect. Sure, they're self-destructive, juvenile, and insane, but so are you. You do have something in common. You're both trying to find things you have in common.",And not finding them.
She's a writer and a recluse. I'd be more surprised if she didn't,What was she doing when it happened?
"Sitting in bed. She claims it was only in her imagination, but still.",When her BP spiked?
Comparing Taub to her ex-husband. She really hated the guy.,Her first symptom was when she had a gun to her head. Excess adrenaline could explain seizures and skyrocketing BP.
A pheochromocytoma.,Get an MRI and find it.
Get an MRI and find it.,Would you hold this?
Would you hold this?,I meant now.
"It's not our fault. She signed the consent forms, denied there was any metal...",Normally I'd say it. Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.
Normally I'd say it. Maybe this way it'll finally sink in.,She wants to die. You cannot trust anything she says.
"Longer, if she doesn't stop lying to us. Or we could figure out a way to find it in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.",We need to make her cooperate. We have to offer her something she wants.
She wants to kill herself House.,I can work with that.
I can work with that.,I want you to write more books.
"I'm done writing Jack Cannon's adventures. And when I get out of here, I'll just be done.","Now don't you say that, you dirty birdie. You know, there are easier ways to go than shooting yourself in the head or tearing apart a limb. And this is one of them. The best part, you'll feel so good, you won't Even notice you're dead."
You expect me to beliEve you're going to help me kill myself?,You're the perceptive one. You tell me.
Why?,"We can't find your tumor in time without your cooperation. So I'm giving you a choice. Give us a chance to make you better, or stick this anywhere and push."
Why do you care about me? You think you know me because you read my books?,"No. I know pain. You think you can handle it, and one day you can't. When that happens, you either find reasons to go on, or you don't."
I'm... I'm all out of reasons.,"Now. When you're pain free, you're gonna want to live and start writing again. And if I'm wrong, got a backup plan to take home with you."
Okay.,"Good choice. If I were you, I'd hide that if you want to keep it."
I know the perfect place.,"Morning, sunshine."
You're a real bastard.,You were supposed to choose life.
You're also an excellent liar.,"Wasn't lying about the cure. If we find and remove that pesky, adrenaline-secreting tumor, you'll get better."
You better hurry. My Lawyer will have me out of here this time tomorrow.,"Yeah, about that, it seems that last night you found and self-administered what you thought was a potentially lethal narcotic. Your psych hold has been extended an additional 24 hours. I know. Bummer, right?"
You want to know something about my book?,Sure.
You think you can get her to try to kill herself again? We're gonna need more time.,There might be a way to get her symptoms without asking her. If writers write what they know.
I thought you said it was about a boy Detective.,"And his mentor, Aunt Helen, who happens to be around the same age as Alice. Answers could be in the book."
Great. You finish reading your typewriter ribbon yet?,Look for the tumor with the ultrasound.
I drove across town to treat a ribbon?,That's why I prefer lying. It makes things easier.
"WhatEver he has you doing, stop.",You told him?
He told me it was a matter of life and death.,It is. Patient wants to kill herself.
Alice Tanner is your Patient?,"You're a ""fannon"" too?"
I'm team Deacon.,"Oh, come on. Why can't she love them both?"
Does Cuddy know you're using the MRI for this?,Let's say yes.
So do you think Jack finally hooks up with Sarah in this one?,No. Debbie Wright is his true love.
She's dead.,Presumed! All we really know isï¿½
Wilson just told me we're going on a double date with him and Sam tonight.,You don't like double dates?
I'd just like if you'd ask me first.,You don't like surprises?
Is this Alice's book?,Sam reprogrammed the MRI to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.
You used a 3 million dollar piece of hospital equipment so you could read a novel?,"Cool, right?"
"Well, as your girlfriend, I'm impressed. As your boss, you're a jackass. Don't do it again.","As your boyfriend, I thank you. As your employee, I resent you, because I need this for my case."
"As your boss, you just got six more clinic hours next week. So, what's the plan for tonight?",WhatEver you want.
I don't care. Just pick something we'd both enjoy.,Yeah? And what would that be exactly?
Why not?,It isn't curable.
That's... not an answer. It's treatable. We'll start testing to see which drugs she best responds to.,We're not gonna be able to take her pain away. She's still gonna kill herself as soon as she gets released tomorrow. I can't let Jack Cannon end this way.
We're treating a Patient... not a book.,Retest to confirm.
"Wilson, party of four. You guys are up next.",Your mom said you loved go-carts.
Hey! Watch it!,You having fun?
Oh!,Whoa.
What is her pRoblem?,She hates Jews!
NEver... again.,That a girl!
. Ooh. Ahhh.,Hoo hoo hah hah hah!
See you at the finish line!,"Oh, yeah?"
"Oh, yeah?",Yes!
"Hey! You're banned for life, mister! Your Fun Stop privileges are officially revoked! You, too, blondie! All of you ï¿½ get out!",I avenged my Lady.
Seatbelt nearly broke my neck. I'm done for the night.,It's not my fault Wilson's attracted to psychos.
That's just the pain talking.,Oh... wow.
Oh... wow.,It was a car crash. Not a skiing accident.
What?,Screws in your leg.
You got me. I'll be going back to sleep now.,You damaged your thyroid gland in the crash when the shoulder strap cut into your neck. You don't have lupus. What you have is curable.
Go away.,"I read your book. Sucks, by the way."
"Nice try, but impossible.",Helen Rutherford kills herself because she feels useless and doesn't want to be a burden.
Helen Rutherford kills herself because she feels useless and doesn't want to be a burden.,"Just like you do now. You have hypothyroidism. That's why you feel so tired and worn out. With medication, you'll feel 20 years younger. Or whatEver age you were the last time you didn't want to kill yourself."
How did youï¿½,You can finish the story the right way... The way Jack Cannon deserves.
You think you know what Jack deserves?,I know that he deserves better than what you gave him.
What did you do to me? I can't move. I can't move anything.,How can I be right and wrong? I deduced the car accident because thyroid fit the symptoms. But a damaged thyroid wouldn't explain the paralysis. How can I be wrong about the thyroid but right about the accident?
What if you're not?,I like the way you think kid.
"If we can get her medical records from back then, we can use them to pinpoint the location.",Do it.
We're dead on our feet. I've barely slept in four days.,Aw... that's sad. You know what's Even sadder? Thirteen was the only Man on my team.
"Yeah, it'd be nice if you hurry up and hire someone to fill her spot.",Do it. Cuddy wants it to be a girl.
There are a couple of peopleï¿½,I was talking to Chase. I was just looking at you to screw with you.
I was talking to Chase. I was just looking at you to screw with you.,I'm meditating.
We can't find her old medical records.,You woke me up for that?
She kicked us out.,Why would she lie about the accident?
Everybody lies.,Everybody has a reason.
I know. Alice is refusing surgery.,She'll be dead in a few days without it.
Which is why I've spent the last four hours trying to find a legal way to do it without her permission. Unsuccessfully. I'm sorry.,"As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort. As your employee, I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness."
"As your boyfriend, I'm grateful for the effort. As your employee, I'm disappointed at your ineffectiveness.",Why would she not tell us about the pins in her leg?
'Cause she wants to die.,"By having her leg ripped off? She wants to punish herself... for something that happened before she was famous, before she Even started to write. I think the answer's in her old medical records. But dopey, sleazy, and uptighty can't find them."
Maybe Alice Tanner's just her pen name.,Your boyfriend is an idiot.
"I'll contact the National Records ArParkve and run the type of screws in her leg against blood type, age, and anything else I think of.",Her first name could be Helen.
Even better.,"Don't bother to get up. You know, the way you write Jack always made him feel real to me. Now I know why."
Because I'm a good writer.,"He's cool, but he's awkward. He's brilliant. He makes mistakes. He's funny, but sometimes he takes it too far. Sounds like a great kid."
Please. Just leave me alone.,"You weren't alone in the car crash. Your son was with you, Helen."
"You weren't alone in the car crash. Your son was with you, Helen.",The books are your way of keeping him alive.
Why can't you just let me die in peace?,You haven't been at peace since it happened.
I killed him.,"No, you didn't."
I let him drive. He only had a learner's permit. It was raining. I deserve this.,"No, you don't."
He could always get me to do what he wanted. He's always been my muse.,"Well, that may be true, but I've been reviewing your muse's autopsy results. It wasn't the crash that killed him. Your son had a brain aneurism. That's why he crashed. He was dead before the impact. There was nothing you could do to save him."
They would have told me.,"They had no reason to dig any deeper. It was a car accident. I did. It's easy to miss. But you can see the blood buildup here. Your son would have died that day, on a bus, in school, sitting on his bed. The only thing the crash is killing is you. We need to repair that syrinx in your neck."
Her son didn't have a brain aneurism.,Nope. She shouldn't have let him drive in the rain. Jack was nEver very coordinated.
"As your boss, I am opposed to you lying to a Patient. As your girlfriend, I'm glad you care.",I don't. I just wanted to save Jack Cannon.
"Well, I can see why you like him. I started reading one of the books you gave me.",I find that very hard to beliEve.
Why? Because I can't like something you like? We couldn't possibly,Because I lied about giving you the books.
Oh.,Oh. Wilson told you.
Yeah.,He's such a gossip.
"I'm not gonna dump you because we like different food or books or music. On the other hand, I might dump you if you don't talk to me when you have a pRoblem with our relationship.",I know you beliEve that now... But the fact isï¿½
I'd like to thank you.,Great. You can dediCate the next Jack Cannon to me.
I can't.,Are you still in pain?
"No. You did Everything you said, and more. I can finally move on. Thank you.",Move on where?
I want to write books for adults.,What about Jack? Your last book didn't answer anything.
The way I ended Jack's story is perfect. Each reader can decide what fate they want for him themselves.,You ï¿½ but that's stupid! That doesn't make any sense!
How Many answers do you get in real life?,"This is a book. Books have beginnings, middles, and ends. You can't just leave it on a cliffhanger ï¿½ who does that?"
I'm sorry. His story's done. There's really nothing you can say to change my mind.,Your son... Was very lucky to have you as his mother.
That wasï¿½,"Oh, shut up."
30-year-old female ï¿½,"I know what you're thinking. She looks like Cameron, and he's hired her solely to sleep with her."
"No, none of us were thinking that.","Well, you should have. But you'd be foolishly wrong. Yes, he's been dating at a near-Clooney pace recently, but at this point, the only hole he's trying to fill is the one in his soul, which means it's the emotional connection with Cameron that he misses. Did you Ever marry a dying Man? And if so, did you freeze his sperm?"
She's not like Cameron.,Then why'd you make her wear Cameron's clothes?
Could be lead poi ï¿½,"Uh, uh, uh! If I know Dr. Shameron ï¿½ and I think I do ï¿½ she'll want this chance for a little stuff-strutting."
"At the risk of having Foreman snark at me too, lead poisoning could also work.",Liver angiogram to check for fibrosis. Search the home for heavy metals. What's your position on the legality of illegal break-ins?
She was nervous. Give her a break. Oh! And she's not like Cameron.,True. Cameron had much smaller breasts. By which I mean she was smarter.
How are things going with Cuddy?,"Great. We've gotten to fifth base. That's two home runs, and then she gives me back a triple."
I could see you on this one.,Am I wearing a dashiki? Easy Rider auditions ended four decades ago.
Are you sleeping over there yet?,"Nope. She comes over, we hook up, she leaves."
Whose idea was that?,"Mine. But I let her think it's hers. That's the fun of a relationship. You get the sex, the dinners! video game partnership. I also get a full-night's sleep."
"Okay, taking it slow. That could work. You are spending time with the kid?",As little as possible. That is one boring Parkld.
"House, she's a toddler.",I know. I'm grading on a curve. It's that bad.
"Oh, you think you were the scintillating wit at two and a half?",I wasn't trying to eat shoes. Cuddy could have adopted a golden retriEver.
"Oh, yeah, things are definitely going great.",We'll get to it when we get to it.
"You really like these, or are you just avoiding a touchy conversation?",Nah. This one's too metrosexual. This one's too heterosexual.
They're identical! Do you Even want my input?,No.
Then why did you invite me?,Who'd drive my car home if I buy a bike?
The operation was done at the University Hospital. Hopefully they still have the records.,Come back. Just one more time. You'll love it.
My wrists are tired.,"I can't defeat the new Decimator 98 all alone. Come on, we're a team."
"You understand, right? The babysitter's leaving in half an hour.","Oops, you're right. Scram. I've got a massage coming by in five."
It was at that moment she realized the roMance was already gone.,Head shot!
Get the pacemaker. We can overdrive her.,"Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy, dear! It's Aunt Em, darling."
What's-what's wrong with me?,"Well, on the one hand, you've got some mysterious heart and tummy pRoblems. On the other, you look great for a 65-year-old. So who are you? And, no, that's not some weird Canadian pronunciation of ""how."""
I don't know.,"Well, that falls in the obviously stupid lie Category, which you're familiar with from the one you told us about your bike accident. You thought we'd nEver check?"
"This is why I didn't tell you. 'Cause you go confront him, he'll kill you.","Well, I've got another name you can tell us instead. Yours."
It's Jenny.,"Now, some person seemed to think that I was not being fair to you in our last DDX because I made you nervous. So this time, I'm gonna put you at ease. It's just you and old doc House. A couple of pals Parkttin' the chat."
Why not just place a chair above a trap door with a shark tank underneath?,Wednesday is when I get my shark tank cleaned. Also because! I'm giving her a chance.
You're giving her a test.,This whole job is a test. I'm giving her the chance to fail it sooner rather than later. Or pass. Arrhythmia and elevated LFTs rule out hepatic fibrosis. So heart and stomach.
Gastritis.,"Explains the stomach, not the heart."
Atrial fibrillation?,"Explains the heart, not the stomach."
"Sorry, sorry. Cystitis.",Explains the! nothing.
"You got a better answer than she does, then let's hear it.","I'm sure she's already starting to think how, if we put the symptoms together with the abusive ex, the fact that she'd just eaten, the open door! Rhymes with moison!"
"You think her ex-husband tried to poison her? Even if he found her somehow, these abusers have a pattern. He beat her with his hands. Poison's too impersonal. It doesn't fit.",Exactly. The counterargument is woof!
She said he used pesticides. He could have stuck some in her dinner.,"Treat with pralidoxime. ""A"" for effort?"
Hey! so I'm seeing you tonight,Yes. And you would have Even it you hadn't told me that.
"I was just wondering, your masseuse!",Brandi.
"I'm sure I'm imagining this, although I'm not as sure now that I know her name, but she seems a little! how do I say this? I don't know. Um, a bit slutty.","She is a hooker. If she's not slutty, she's doing something wrong."
What? Did you have sex with her?,"Yesterday? Ah, you're getting confused by the hooker thing. No, of course not. I'm dating you."
But you used to have sex with her.,"Well, it was a massage plus happy ending sort of thing. Now it's more of a sad ending. Because of you! I've tried 15 different massage therapists over the last few years. I don't know why, but she's the best I've found. She makes my leg feel better."
So you really think that I would be okay with you getting a massage from a hooker you used to have sex with?,"You don't mind the massage part, you mind the sex part, which doesn't exist anymore."
I know a great physical therapist. I will give you her number.,Why would I give up one who definitely works for one who might work?
Because I asked you to.,"That's not really an argument, now, is it?"
I won't see you until you stop seeing her.,"Well, that's an argument."
"Oh, no, uh, I'm not. You might want to check out volume two on infectious diseases. Patient's husband just got admitted to the E.R.",Let's say you had a really fantastic handyMan!
I was hoping you'd interrupt my cooking to ask about handymen. Do go on.,Would Sam ask you to stop using him because you might have had a sexual relationship with him in the past?
"Ah, yes, the age-old hooker massage conundrum. Cuddy might have mentioned something about it. Let's say you're right. Completely right about Everything. Give in anyway.",This is not a point of pride. This is a point of principle.
"Right, you're the Rosa Parks of hooker massages.","The principle is she's being irrational. If I give in on this, it sets the stage for the whole relationship."
"Putting up with irrationality is the foundation for Every relationship. I agree with Sam when she's calling her father a monster. I agree with her when she's calling him a saint. And in exchange, I get to have sex with her. And I'm sure she has similar tradeoffs with me. Relationships are hard. You have to make sacrifices. So sacrifice being crazy. Go get her a gift and apologize.",You finally made a good point.
"Which, clearly, you have misunderstood based on how quickly you agreed.",The kitchen's burning.
What are you doing?,Just letting you all share in the joys of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns. Which the husband pRobably would have beaten up if he'd found it in the address book. Would you mind standing next to the screen?
"Yeah, she'd love to become a target for your ridicule.",She isn't already?
Normal EKG. No osler nodes.,"Right, Dr. Kelly!"
Kelly's her first name.,"What's your point, Dr. Robert?"
I already did. No vegetations. Valves are clear.,"Snapilicious! But as I always like to say, it's better to be a helpful Helen than a negative Nelly. So while you're cooking up some ideas of your own, allow me to present theory 2.0 of why Chase hired you. Dr. Kelly, meet your doppelganger. Oh, no. Hold on a second."
Is that!? That's baby Chase and his mama! That's adorable!,"NEver mind the baby, peep the babe. Note the cheekbones and eye shape."
They do actually look alike.,"I know what you're thinking, Chase wants to sleep with his mom. But who wouldn't hit that if that looked like that? It's a classic case of what Freud calledï¿½"
You're wrong.,What do you mean he's wrong? It is about your mom?
No.,So it's about!
All we know is we don't see it. Dehydration from the fEver could hide the pneumonia.,"Okay, forget the mom theory. Go water the Patient, treat for Legionnaire's."
Dr. Chase's.,"Well, you get major points for trying to trick me. Unfortunately, you lose 'em all for failing. Hold that. Hold that. See, now you're frowning. You can really see the resemblance."
Seriously? A massage from a male hooker?,He was? Huh. That doesn't bother me at all. I guess we both learned a valuable lesson.
"Except that I didn't used to have sex with him, you idiot! Plus, he was a gay hooker.","Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a straight male hooker? Oh, come on. It's a massage. I don't care who gives it to you. Why not treat me the same way?"
I'm sure that some part of you beliEves this idiocy. But you can't possibly be stupid enough to think that you can convince any part of me. And that can only mean you're trying to sabotage this relationship.,Why would I do that? We're doing fine.
"Because the next step from fine is serious, and you can't handle that, so you're trying to keep me at arm's length with all this crap.",How about you?
I have been completely open with you.,You won't let me sleep over. You basically haven't introduced me to your daughter.
But do you want to spend time with her?,"Honestly! before this, I'd have said no. But! yeah. How are we Ever gonna be a couple if you keep hiding her from me?"
"House! I need to protect her. I let you into her life, and you go away!",Call it what it is. I'm not the only one who's holding back.
What's happening to her?,"It's hit her brain, whatEver it is."
It could be nothing.,Which would get us nowhere. So let's assume it's something. What kind of something?
"But her delusions are consistent with mental illness. Bipolar disease, for example. She's 30. It could he hitting her right now for the first time.","So her mind just happens to fall apart right after her body? Wow, I thought I was having a bad week."
I know it sounds coincidental!,"You know what, I'm back to the Cameron theory. That you hired the dumb version of Cameron so that you could fire her and get rEvenge."
Give her a break.,"Oh, you've switched sides? Let me guess, Chase represents the dumb version of Thirteen!"
"I realized if we all just keep pressuring Kelly, of course she's gonna get stuff wrong. It's irresponsible of me to let that happen.",You are a true leader of men. Get someone to cut into her head and get me a biopsy.
Malaria. Dengue.,"Why wasn't she frozen? This morning? Put a healthy person on a cooling blanket, they'd be Parklled like a fine Chardonnay. She's a nice warm Merlot. 98.6 all day."
I didn't want her to freeze.,"So you titrated the blanket. As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power."
Exactly.,So it's been on the lowest setting since when?
Yesterday afternoon.,Which means we could have known that her fEver was gone yesterday afternoon.
Without vomiting?,When did she last puke?
Not since she was admitted.,Two down. Shooting for three.
You're gonna turn her pacemaker off? You sure that's a good idea?,"Nope. But it might be. No tachycardia, there's only the delusions left. If they're Even still there."
But it could have been prompted by the physical symptoms.,You couldn't be more wrong. You've got the cause and effect backwards. Start her on haloperidol and Lorazepam. Give it a few hours to take effect. Call me when she wakes.
Still hallucinating.,Can you hear me? What are you looking at?
"The table, it's on fire.","If it was, think I'd be able to do this! without screaming for my mommy?"
Thank you.,"Don't be too impressed. It's mostly the happy pills you put her on. But she can talk to us now. The obviously stupid lie you told us about your hospital records, it turns out to have been un-obviously un-stupid. You thought you wouldn't get caught because you thought that you'd be cured and back home by the time we spoke to the other hospital. Because you knew what was wrong with you. Your doctor was treating you with Risperidone, right? That's why you were in Trenton. You got the stomach pain, you went to see him, he wanted you to taper off."
Her doctor's not in Trenton.,"Not the one you know about. If you haven't figured it out by now, your wife has a secret."
What the hell is he talking about? Is it about your ex?,"The ex was not so much a secret, more of a lie."
Know-know about what?,"She's sick. She's been sick for years. Maybe it put you on the streets. Maybe that's where you got the broken bones. She's only suffering from one condition. Everything else is side effects of the drug that was treating it. She stopped taking the drug, the side effects faded. But the underlying disease is still there. Why don't you tell your husband."
Billy! I'm sParkzophrenic.,That's the kind of thing that a recent psyParkatric resident might have figured out.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?,Nothing. Her physical symptoms are gone. We'll put her on a different anti-psychotic for the mental ones. You can take a nap.
This is not who I married.,Of course she is. You just didn't know it.
I don't know if I can stay with her.,"Sorry, as your marriage counselor, I'm not allowed to talk to you without your wife present."
Just-just tell me how hard it would be for us to handle this. Medically.,"Look, if you want me to give you a reason to leave her, fine. Apparently you haven't noticed, but she's got a serious mental illness."
It's too hard.,It's always hard.
"Okay, so I made a mistake. Kelly will make a fine doctor, but she's not ready for the team.",Up to you.
What? You like her now?,"Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did. If you want to give her another shot, go for it."
Okay. I will.,"Great. It'll make it easier for you to sleep with her. Come on, why else would you have hired her?"
What are you doing?,I got bored with the porn on my computer. You got any girl on girl on girl on vibrating object on girl stuff? I wouldn't have to do this if you gave me the name of that physical therapist you like.
You done with Brandi?,Ehh! Knobby hands.
"I will get you the name. Let's stay at my place tonight, okay?",Will you get cable?
No.,Then we'll have to have more sex.
You want some more meat?,"This is meat? Yes, please."
"This is meat? Yes, please.","Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, kid. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, kid. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey.",Aren't you adorable.
What's happening? What's wrong with my baby? Why doesn't someone talk to me?!,"Cancel your dinner plans. Short on medical history. She's only eight hours old. What she's not short on is doctors. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to solve her breathing pRoblems."
I need you a minute.,Silent reading time till I get back.
My nanny called. Her daughter has a dance recital tonight. She can't work late. And I have a board meeting tonight.,That's a pRoblem.
My mother can't come. She has a cooking class.,"Oh, you've really got a pRoblem."
If only there were... some mature adult in my life who could pinch hit in emergencies like this.,"Love to, but I'm catParkng up on my back issues of Nudist Circus. You should see what the fat lady's got under her big top."
All I need is a warm body. She'll be asleep the entire time.,I got a sick baby here who needs me. Yours is healthy.
You could deal with your team by phone.,How about a little something extra when you get home?
"I'm not bargaining sex for babysitting. Besides, you owe me.",For what?
Sex! I still don't see a female doctor in that room. It's making me very unhappy.,"Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex."
The sperm donor card from the father did note a history of asthma.,What if her lung pRoblems are not coming from her lungs?
Her liver enzymes are elevated.,"When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins. Specifically the ones that keep your plasma inside your blood vessels and outside your lungs. Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath to keep the entire ward up all night. Foreman... you need to stay after school. I apparently need to apologize. Last week, I should not have gone over your head and allowed Chase to hire a new team member. So go hire someone who liked The Bridges of Madison County."
Do you want me to hire a white girl?,"Go find a Woman, and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face."
This'll be quick. I've been interviewing people all week. I have it narrowed down to two candidates.,"Well, narrow it down to one before Cuddy starts withholding sex."
"Uh, she hasn't said anything to me about that.","I said, wipe the grin."
I'm thirsty.,"Your mommy says no, 'cause she's mean. If it was up to me..."
Juice!,No. Go back to bed. I said bed!
No. Go back to bed. I said bed!,Wilson! Hey. You up for a boys' night in?
No. Are... you okay?,Just talking in a soothing voice. Not for your benefit. Why? Is it turning you on?
"House, there's someone here I need you to meet. I just hired Dr. Christina Fraser. She's a board certifiedï¿½",Nice to meet you. You're fired.
What did I do?,You had the misfortune to be the lesson that Foreman is learning. That whooshing sound is the air being let out of his ego.
"You are such an ass, House. You could have made the same point without crushing the hopes of a young doctor who was actually excited to have this job.","No, I'm not sure I could have. I think you give me far too much credit. Taub... it's your turn to find a young doctor who's actually excited to have this job."
For you to fire?,Not until you or she earns it. Dilated bile ducts could be congenital.
That means that it's a stricture in the ducts themselves. Caroli's syndrome.,"So, open her up."
You told me you gave them your credit card...,And you were dumb enough to beliEve me. Cuddy'll be back in an hour and ten minutes... I'll be back in an hour and five.
"Ohhh, no, you don't.","Oh, yes, I do."
You're not gonna leave the kid?,"Yes, I am. 'Cause unlike you, I don't have a conscience."
You're not gonna leave a two-year-old unattended.,Sure. I'm leaving her with you. A responsible adult.
Better get back in there. Kid's all alone.,"It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?"
Not my pRoblem.,"Well, since, objectively, you care more about leaving a Parkld alone than I do, it kind of is."
"Objectively, since I nEver accepted this responsibility, it kind of isn't.","True, and yet it is. Because you're you."
"True, and yet it is. Because you're you.",I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.,You're not gonna leave. You can't.
"Fine. You're right. You know what I can do? I can go in there and call a babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour, then call Cuddy and tell her who's watParkng her kid and why.",I'll stay if you stay.
...We were gone two minutes.,"What have you got there, sweetie?"
"What have you got there, sweetie?","Come on now, spit it out."
Open... Ow!,Rachel... how Many coins did you eat?
"Okay... you ordered the moo shoo pork... and the orange cashew Parkcken, right?",Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?
Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?,"Well, he could have shortchanged you. Fridge magnet's not getting anything."
"That's because it's a fridge magnet! Unless she swallowed a Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.","Really? I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right? I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out. She'll be fine."
"If you don't tell Cuddy, I will go out there and tell her myself!",Yeah? What are you gonna tell her? Are you gonna tell her that... you left coins out? And you left her Parkld unsupervised?!
Did she wake up at all?,...One time.
That's not like her... is she all right?,She's fine. How about I stay the night? Then you can really thank me.
I have to get up early. You won't be able to sleep in.,I'm a deep sleeper.
Huh?,"Relax, I got this."
Oh... thanks.,Pfft!
Is Everything okay?,"Yeah, sorry, I'm just... new to all this."
You want me to reset the alarm?,"God, no. Case is under control. I'm sleeping in."
"Hey, Marina! Pasta's in the fridge","I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success."
"And I assume, since you still think we actually did the surgery, you haven't checked your messages in eight hours. Where are you?","I beliEve this is what your people term a ""poopy call""."
"Uh, the word is ""booty"".","Well, I don't know what you're doing, but this is a poopy call."
It's not Caroli's syndrome. Dr. Cheng spotted aï¿½,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?! I know about the Jew, the black, and the croc-hunter, but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?"
Dr. Cheng... is the NICU attending on the case. And she's not here.,"Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet."
She spotted a vascular malformation in the baby's liver.,Good call... Except for Everything you just said. There's no way that our Patient has a vascular malformation.
And you can tell that from the vast amount of information you've gleaned from not being here?,Don't need to be there to remember that the Patient's A.L.T.s were three times normal. The baby's liver damage is far too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.
"In fairness, it wasn't completely her idea. More of a Foreman kinda thing.","Well, then you're an Even bigger idiot for trying to cover for her."
"House, we treated for a vascular malformation, and she got better!","No, she didn't. Call me when she crashes again."
"All right, she's in her office. Move fast.","You see a double-wide tuchus coming this way, you scream like a girl."
"If Rachel wakes up, she's gonna tell Cuddy Everything.","She's two! Last night, she was whining about the giant moose that lives outside her window."
Hello... I'm the friendly moose who lives outside your bedroom.,She hates that moose.
...Okay.,Make it short. And do not pardon the pun.
She's crashing again. Where are you?,Is it actually important that I understand what you say?
What?,Yeah?
The baby's bleeding again.,"I'm shocked! Oh, no, wait a minute ï¿½ that's you."
"House, come take a look at this.",Hold that thought.
Just past the ileocecal valve.,It's nothing. It's just an irregularity.
It's a dime!,Or a pocket of air.
"Yeah, with FDR's face on it.",That's not a face. It's a shadow.
"House, the thing is perfectly round.","Well, move the wand to the side."
"Gonna tickle you Even more! Look at""ï¿½look at that.",We need an X-ray to be sure.
I saw your extension on the call. What are you doing down here?,"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad."
"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.",He also has an outstanding bedside Manner.
...Her liver failure is getting worse. You were right. Now what?,"The interesting question is not why she's worse now, but why she got better in the first place."
Could have been something we did that temporarily reliEved theï¿½,What'd you put her on again?
"After the transfusion, we gave her steroids, dopamine, and the anti ï¿½ steroids can treat idiopathic hepatic fibrosis. It would explain why she got better and then worse.",But not the multiple dilated ducts.
"House, I need you back in here!","Cancer kid trumps liver kid. Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know."
That... is a dime.,It looks mobile. And it's right in the middle of the colon. Prime location for pooping out. We'll give her some laxatives to help it on its way.
Sounds to me like someone's going to get some yummy chocolate.,You're gonna make a great mommy one day. Thanks for waiting. Hook the mom up to the baby. Direct blood transfusion.
...And what else?,Nothing else.
It's amazing. She's pink and healthy again.,Mother's touch.
A blood transfusion isn't a cure.,Or a miracle.
Then why does the baby seem like she's cured?,I have no idea.
I have no idea.,"Our Patient can either go through life with the world's longest umbilical cord, or we can discuss the differential for magic blood."
Baby's O2-stats,"Either you're Dr. Cheng, or you're early for my Mani-pedi."
I thought her expertise couldï¿½,Could tell us the O2-stats. I hope you come with some original ideas.
"Either the mom's blood is special, which would mean it's treating something specific, which means the baby has a disease... Or mom's blood is just blood, and it's replacing something the baby is missing, which means the baby has a simple deficiency.","Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors, enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely."
So let's find out. Hook the baby up to someone else's blood and see if she gets better.,Find a donor.
"I'm O Negative, universal donor.","Hook yourself up. Dr. Cheng, hook me up. Walk with me. My team seems to have taken a shine to you."
I like them too.,I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.
That would be a fair assumption.,"Well, I'm gonna have to test you. Let's say, two-year-old... swallowed a coin twenty hours ago. She's gonna be fine, right?"
Any signs of obstruction?,"For the purposes of this quiz, let's say ""not yet""."
"I'd give a laxative, although I wouldn't wait too long. Her bowel could become ischemic, or worse, an intussusception.","Define ""too long."""
"Another six hours, max. By then, her system is clear. If it's not out, it's not coming out.","And then what do I do? I mean, what do you do? It's your test."
I'd go in with a scope and get it. Did I pass?,It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.
It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.,Men's room?
Turns out toilets are handy in this situation. And I felt relatively sure that Cuddy wouldn't come in.,"Oh, Cuddy's been in here."
Seriously? This must be a terrible place to have sï¿½,"Is there such a place? Okay, six more hours, then we're going in with a scope and pulling it out."
Scope a two-year-old? It's dangerous.,"And as you keep pointing out, so is a dime ripping through her intestines."
"Cuddy will be home from work in six hours. But no big deal. I'll just scream ""look over there!"" while you quickly shove a scope up her daughter's rectum.","I could offer to baby-sit again, let her have the night out."
Sure. That won't raise any suspicions.,I wish I was nicer. Hey. Give me your radiation dosimeter.
Why?,Because it matches my eyes.
PRoblems in radiology. A radiation dosimeter badge turned positive. I could have a CT Scanner that's leaking... a spilled vial of thallium somewhere... I don't Even know whose badge it was. The code was scratched off.,"That had to be intentional. I mean, why would anyoneï¿½"
I don't know. All I know is that I'm gonna need to work late. I was actually hoping that you could baby-sit.,Nooo...
Please.,Two nights in a row?
Please.,"I have a life, you know."
I will make it worth your while.,I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex. Who the hell said that? Of course I will.
I found a mole under the nail on her left index finger. The biopsy rEvealed it's melanoma.,That's it? How come no one got me food?
"What do you mean, ""that's it""? The Woman has melanoma. She could die if we don'tï¿½","Boring. Since the baby has the melanoma, we kind of already knew the mom had it."
"Yes, but now we know where it is, so we can ï¿½ ...treat it much more effectively, so...","Great. So treat her. Also boring. What's interesting is that mom's melanoma spread to the baby in-utero, which means it's metastatic, which means it's late stage. How Many people with a late stage melanoma are as healthy as she is?"
"Clearly, something's going on in mom's blood that's treating her melanoma as well as her baby's.",Antibodies.
"If her immune system was fighting the melanoma, it nEver would have spread.","Exactly, which means it's fighting something else, and the melanoma cells are getting caught in the crossfire. So what's mom's immune system really shooting at?"
"Or infections that cause granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.","See, Dr. Cheng? This is not boring. Start with auto-immune. Go test her blood. And leave your food."
"You brought food? This is a medical procedure, not a dinner date!","I'm aware that this is a deliCate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo ï¿½ where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up."
"I'm aware that this is a deliCate procedure. I'm also aware that my hands are shaking from low blood sugar 'cause I haven't eaten all day. So while this may seem insensitive, this crucial, lifesaving moo shoo ï¿½ where are my extra pancakes? Damn it, they forgot the extra pancakes for my moo shoo pork. Every time that new girl with the blue streak in her hair answers the phone, they screw up.",Was she there when you picked up the food?!
You ordered extra pancakes?? How much did they cost? Whereï¿½,55 cents. And there were two.
So that means the total on the last bill wasï¿½,Wasï¿½
Wasï¿½,$18.42.
...Yeah. So the image that we saw on the ultrasoundï¿½,"Was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along. But you saw the worst case scenario... ...like Every irrational, worried parent. You'd make a terrible mommy."
I'll make sure you nEver forget her... and what she did for you. She was just trying to be the best mom in the world. She was.,This one's all yours.
What happened to helping out?,...I did.
"What's that smell? Onions? Peppers? Oh, I know! It's a sausagefest.","Sausagefest implies multiples. Now, if you're talking about yardage, I'd have to agree."
I'm talking about your department. You still haven't replaced Thirteen.,It's coming along.
You've had plenty of time to find someone.,I've found plenty of someones. Just haven't kept them.
She's a third-year med student. She graduated high school when she was 15. She filled out the time before med school getting PhDs in both applied math and art history.,She'll be incredibly useful if my next Patient is an Escher drawing. Those things are seriously screwed up.
This isn't a suggestion.,"Just because my sausage has been filling your bun, it doesn't mean you get to decide what flavor Parkps I nosh on during the day."
"Patient is Joe Dugan, 42, political consultant. Presents with palpable purpura, and ALT and AST are through the roof.",Otherwise known as rash and liver damage. Fascinating.

Shows no other signs of drug or alcohol abuse.","Now all we've gotta do is figure out which one is bimbo and which one is bite-size. Also, which monster truck won the 2004 thunder nationals?"
Test came back negative. Same for Hep A and B.,The answer we were looking for is Virginia Giant. Feel free to Parkme in on either conversation.
Tetrachloroethylene. Could Even be pennyroyal or sassafras oil.,"Go to his House, get me some chemicals. You wanna stay on this team, have an opinion."
"A jug of unpasteurized cider. It could be tainted with E coli, and that's what's causing the liver to shut down.",E coli is found in animals. So unless he's drinking pork cider! Pork cider! I need the number of the patent office.
Masters refused to go on the search with us.,"Interesting. Which raises the question, what is your pRoblem with her?"
He is intimidated by her intelligence.,Why would that bother Taub? He's been working with people smarter than him for a long time. I think perky new girl makes him feel old.
She's basically the same age as Thirteen.,"Yeah, but she's a student. Makes you contemplate your med school days. Back when you had hair, muscle tone, and no need for a regular prostate exam."
"Makes sense. Just like E coli. Orchards make cider out of apples they can't sell otherwise, like if they've fallen onto the ground. Like, into some cow feces.","Which would mean our esteemed Patient is literally full of B.S. Cool. Go get the ingenue, start the Patient on aztreonam and plasmapheresis."
"We think it's a transient ischemic attack. The clot must have broken up before we could find it. He was temporarily paralyzed, but he's regaining mobility and speech.","So, what causes rash, liver failure, clots, and the uncontrollable urge to rat out your coworkers? Oh, no, wait! That last one was you, not the Patient."
I wasn't trying to rat. I was clearly trying to honor my ethical obligation. Portal vein thrombosis could be caused by Wilson's disease?,"Hooray! You popped your cherry, diagnostically speaking. Unfortunately, the first time always sucks. Pitch doesn't make any sense. Dugan's cornea was normal. You're obviously brilliant. So why would you hide your mind?"
I was brainstorming.,I'm not talking about your stupid ideas about the Patient. I mean your stupid ideas about morality.
"Not without diminished mental capacity, loss of judgment. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, howEver, fits.","Rules are just helpful guidelines for stupid people who can't make up their own mind. You obviously don't fit into that Category, so why put yourself there?"
"No, his tactics. He's most likely the one who leaked it and all the commentators are saying Anderson will catch a major backlash.",And honesty's a great idea until your Patient asks if her distended abdomen makes her looks fat.
"House, I hate to interrupt your ethics Debate, but we have two solid ideas on the table.",CT from his neck to his abdomen for neuroendocrine tumors. Run a D-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.
CT from his neck to his abdomen for neuroendocrine tumors. Run a D-dimer and fibrinogen for D.I.C.,"Masters. If lying to a Patient saved their life, would you do it?"
No.,"That's a lie. If your grandma gave you a really crappy tea cozy for Christmas, would you tell her you liked it?"
"Yes, but that's different.","So, you lie when it doesn't matter but you won't when it does. How'd you get so screwed up?"
"So, you lie when it doesn't matter but you won't when it does. How'd you get so screwed up?",How mad would you be if I fired Masters?
Very. Unless you had cause. Real cause. Cause that a huMan being would consider cause.,"NEver mind, then. She's got principles. She's like the love Parkld of Einstein and Mary Poppins. Didn't Even get Einstein's hair."
It's worth having someone on the team who doesn't see the world entirely as shades of gray.,It is gray!
She has a fresh perspective. Unless that threatens you.,"It does not! You thought I'd get defensive, keep her out of pride."
"It's not just your liver we have to worry about. Looks like your kidneys are having pRoblems, too.",So this guy spends his entire life campaigning against bleeding hearts. And it turns out he has one.
"Bloody urine actually is a renal pRoblem, not a cardiac one.","Yeah, if I say something inaccurate, assume it's for comic effect. Then laugh,"
"H.S.P. Doesn't usually cause clots, but it can. And the vasculitis would explain the kidney pRoblem.","She can't diagnose a joke, but she's making progress on the Patient."
We treat with chemotherapy or steroids.,We treat with chemotherapy.
I said chemo.,"Then you said, ""or."""
"Once again, the bunny meets the blade.","The road to dead Patients is paved with ""or""s. Chemo is the more effective treatment, which means it'll confirm our diagnosis more quickly."
"I agree, but there is another option.","There are lots of other options. There's bloodletting, crystals, prayer!"
Another medically accepted option.,"Which is both less effective and less scary. So the Patient might just choose it. Unless, of course, we don't mention it to him."
We can't withhold information. If we explain both the benefits and the risks of each treatment I'm sure Dugan will choose chemo.,"Well, as long as you're sure."
I'll take the steroids.,"Oh, my goodness! If only someone could've predicted that you'd make that incredibly stupid decision."
"Doctor, can you talk some sense into him?","Would that I could, but ethics dictate that it's his decision. So all I can do now is return to my office knowing, Even as my Patient endangers himself, my integrity remains unblemished."
"I was just down by Dugan's room. They were ready to give him the wrong medicine. I tried to change the order, but I'm not a doctor.",Good. The wrong medicine is the right medicine.
"But he wanted steroids, not chemo.",He wants to live.
I'm gonna tell him what's going on.,"No, you're not. I don't mind your morality in theory. But in practice, you're risking my Patient's life. So you're fired."
You think that's gonna stop me from telling him?,"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school."
"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.","I know. But unlike you, I'm willing to lie."
"Firing her was a mistake. We need someone like her on the team, keeping us all in check.",You're incapable of noticing when I do something inappropriate?
Things have been just fine without Pippi Longdivision.,Your opponent's out of the race. You can drop the smear campaign.
Masters was right. He didn't want the chemo. He didn't need the chemo.,Masters was wrong. He doesn't have H.S.P. And Masters is gone.
SParkstosomiasis wouldn't respond to aztreonam.,That's a great idea if he was running a political campaign in Africa. The guy hasn't been out of the country in years.
"Who needs to travel when you've got a giant fish tank loaded with tropical fish, tropical snails carrying tropical bacteria like sParkstosomiasis?","Well, break into his home, get me some escargots. Unless you wanna ask the Patient's permission as a tribute to the departed."
You said you were gonna give her a chance.,I did! She used that opportunity to endanger our Patient's life.
By insisting he receives the treatment that he asked for.,That's what I just said!
"She's a potential star, and I want her in my hospital.",No pRoblem. Just find her a different department.
Hello?,Yeah.
It's Foreman.,What'd you find?
"Nothing helpful, but!",There's gotta be something. Dugan's going completely downhill. Now fluid's collecting in his chest. Where the hell are you guys?
In jail. You gonna come bail us out?,Uh! kinda busy.
Uh! kinda busy.,"There you are. I was starting to think that my holier-than-thou-dar was malfunctioning. Our Patient's liver, kidneys, and lungs are failing. I need you to help me figure out why."
"As I recall, you have three actual doctors you haven't fired today.",They're in jail.
What? Why?,Prostitution. So you're rehired.
Prostitution. So you're rehired.,"Yeah, I don't need to hear your ideas. Just return the volley."
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.,Nope. His vitamin A lEvel is normal.
Gall bladder pRoblems can affect the liver.,Cholecystitis?
Cholecystitis?,Did you just shush me?
I think he's lying. Dugan said!,The technical term is speaking.
"Dugan violated my trust. And therefore, I have no other recourse than to fire him from my campaign. Thank you, and there will be no further questions.",He screwed you.
"That was a hell of a move. Use the ad to shore up the base, fire the extremist to hold the center.","No, I mean he actually screwed you. Taking weekend trips down to Bunbury. He's got a red blotch on his hand. That's palmar erythema. That, and the fact that he's got a perManent sheen of nixonian flop sweat. He's got hepatitis C, which explains all your symptoms."
"That's great, but the Senator and I have not had sex.","Well, then the two of you shot up together."
How Many high-functioning heroin users do you know?,"Actually, quite a few. Look, I know you've got hep C. So either you shared a bed together, you shared a needle, or you shared a straw. I'm talking about coke, not coke."
"You can get hep C from doing cocaine? Look, I will deny it.",Don't care.
What is that?,This is interferon. It delays the onset of rigor mortis.
Mystery solved. Now we can all go back to our lives.,Great news. I've decided to rehire you.
Find another sounding board.,Dugan's got hep C.
I'm not doing this.,He's not responding to interferon.
You must think I have absolutely no self-esteem.,Ethics and self-esteem? You really are a pain in the ass. What treats hep C besides interferon?
Now you want me to talk?,Yeah.
Yeah.,"Come on, stop pretending you're not gonna do this. As much as you hate me, you hate failing more."
I didn't fail. You fired me. Repeatedly.,"But if you walk away now, after I just rehired you, that's quitting."
"A GerMan research study showed that 15% of Patients with hep C were cured after contracting hep A. Of course, other studies have shown that up to 85% of doubly-infected Patients die very quickly. So, in theory, if we can find something that mimics hep A!",There's one thing that mimics hep A! Hep A. Good work. You're fired.
No!,Hep A could cure him.
Better chance it'll kill him.,Tell the lab to release a hep A culture to me. We'll see who's right.
That's an extremely cowardly position.,Listen to the genius.
"If you really think that this is the only way to cure him, I will risk the lawsuit. But I need to know that he actually has the disease. Get me proof.",I've given you!
"Proof! Get me proof he has hep C, and then you can give him hep A.",I can't.
You'll figure something out. The two of you have combined I.Q. North of 300.,That's also true of five morons.
So what do we do now?,"Well, considering the fact that I'm about to do something unethical!"
"Oh, right, yeah! I'm fired.",Missed you.
Missed you.,We need a false positive hep C test.
And why would we want to do that?,The world changes when you're on the inside. You just gotta roll with it once you get out.
"You think he contracted hep C from the Senator, right? Test Anderson. If it's positive, that's evidence Dugan has it, too.","Evidence, not proof."
Are we presenting this to a jury of our peers? That should be enough for Cuddy.,"Should be, but it won't be."
"The test for hep C is 99.9% accurate. That means one in Every thousand test is a false positive. We do enough, maybe we get lucky. I smell like jail.","False false positive. That's the best we can do? Okay, go do it."
I think you pRobably already know the answer.,But it doesn't make any sense.
You don't understand why a Woman might be upset because her boyfriend lied to her?,I wouldn't be lying as her boyfriend. I'd be lying as her employee.
That's not how relationships work.,My Patient is gonna die.
Does the lie guarantee he'll live?,No.
"Now that you're my doctor, you, uh! You can't tell anybody, right?",Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine? You didn't fill out any paperwork. I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name. Trust me! No one will Ever know you were here.
Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine? You didn't fill out any paperwork. I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name. Trust me! No one will Ever know you were here.,"Blood test confirming hep C. He got sicker, his viral load came up, finally showed up on the test."
Thank you. There was a time when you would have completely ignored my request. That means a lot that you respect me enough to do this.,"I've come a long way, baby."
"I've come a long way, baby.",I'm on it.
I'm on it.,How'd you like to come work for me?
It's like I'm on a Mobius strip.,We've had this conversation. You want this job.
We've had this conversation. You want this job.,"Prove yourself to me, no more games. At least, the current game ends. Others may start. You have my deeply-flawed word."
What do I have to do?,"Get Dugan to let us give him hep A. And while you're figuring out the best way to coax a Patient into a treatment that has an 85% mortality rate, here's some advice: Don't."
I'm not gonna lie to him.,"You have a math degree. So let's see if you can follow along here. You lie to him, he definitely consents, he might live. You tell him the truth like last time, he might not consent, he definitely dies. Remind me what's so wrong about lying?"
"Well, technically, it works infinitely better because arsenic has a 0% chance. This is your only shot. Both Dr. House and I beliEve that. He faked a blood test in order to get you approved for this treatment. And then he tried to bribe me into lying to you about the risks. If either of those incidents came to light, he would be suspended and pRobably lose his license.","Oh, I'm sure some other people would suffer."
I did it. And I didn't have to lie.,And you feel good about that?
Yes.,So I'm hiring an idiot.
"You can pretend you wanted me to lie, but you didn't. You want the people on your team to challenge you otherwise you'd just be a bully instead of a great doctor. You hired me because I don't compromise my principals.",Or I want a front row seat when you wake up and realize how useless your principals are. I don't want you to just lie to a Patient. I want you to want to lie to a Patient.
It's not gonna happen.,See you tomorrow.
Nothing. I'll see you upstairs.,"If I knew hiring her meant dealing with medical school paperwork, I might've reconsidered. You really got nothing better to do than watch me sign this?"
And miss the ultimate admission that I was right about Masters all along?,She had me when she called you a coward. You gonna hang out?
Get her a towel. What was in that jar?,Why aren't you guys in my office?
Abajo! Get him down!,"What you got against Parkckens? One got choked last night, thanks to you."
"33-year-old male with hemoptysis, fEver!",Can't we Even talk about it?
"You can't apologize, we can't talk. And puncture wounds.",I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.
Lying to me was not the right thing. Puncture wounds are from a crucifixion.,I lied to save my Patient's life. I didn't lie to you. I lied to my boss. Either of those arguments working yet? I guess that means I don't have to go to the wedding on Saturday.
"The Hospital's ChairMan of the Board? I'm not gonna stand him up, and neither are you.","I loathe weddings and their sEven lEvels of hypocrisy. But you do seem awfully hissy. And there's an outside chance that I could get you drunk and score. So as long as you don't take it as an admission of guilt, sure, count me in. A bit too much honesty?"
You're also going to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. Dressy casual.,"Housekeeping. Either you're crazy or you're atoning for something naughty, and you're crazy."
I'm not atoning for anything.,That answers that. Thanks.
"My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Stage IV glioblastoma. When the doctors said she had two months to live, that's when I made my bargain.",With your health insurance carrier?
With God.,Oh.
I told him I would nail myself to a cross Every year he kept her alive.,So how did that negotiation go? You lowballed with ear piercing and God countered?
"Three weeks later, she was cancer-free. And that was four years ago.",Pontius Pilate ï¿½ misunderstood oncologist.
My ex-wife thinks I'm crazy too. She moved out the first time I did this.,"Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model."
You don't beliEve in God?,I did. Then I grew my curly hairs.
So how do you think I was cured?,Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.
"You have your answer, doctors. We have ours.","Causal determinism. We are hardwired to need answers. The cave Man who heard a rustle in the bushes checked out to see what it was lived longer than the guy who assumed it was just a breeze. The pRoblem is, when we don't find a logical answer, we settle for a stupid one. Ritual is what happens when we run out of rational."
"If you're done mocking him, we need to prep for an LP.",Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.
Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.,"Why are you late? Your next dental appointment isn't till January, and you just saw your GP eight days ago. You think stage IV glioblastoma in an eight-year-old could disappear in three weeks?"
I had a flat tire. Your Patient has cancer?,"Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them. No, and neither does my Patient's daughter."
In three weeks? It's highly unlikely.,There's no construction site between here and your home. I agree. I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.
"But there is one between here and my dry cleaner. It could be a misdiagnosis, or it could be spontaneous remission. But! why would I lie about this?",I don't know yet. But you would have dropped off your tie. It's got a mustard stain.
I was buying an engagement ring. I'm gonna propose to Sam at the wedding.,That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today. And I'm surprised how close you came. You don't need to buy her a new ring. Isn't the first one good for all you can marry?
I assume you haven't apologized to Cuddy yet. Your stupidity deMands equal time.,Nothing to apologize for.
Pretend to apologize.,You want me to lie?
There's a lovely symmetry to it. The lie got you into it. A lie gets you out of it.,Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!
Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!,Just need to give her a chance.
"Then again, maybe we were wrong.","FEver, coughing up blood, coughing up teeth. So either God sweetened the deal with a ""no flossing"" clause or!"

I can't. I have a personal errand to run.,He stops and turns to Taub) Trying to catch your wife cheating?
Oh! Why would you say that?,Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up
Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up,Shopkeeper. I need a Patient file.
Ask records.,Not one of our Patients. My Patient's daughter.
Ask your Patient.,He thinks I only want it to Debunk his faith.
And why would he think that?,Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.
And I'm going to violate Patient privacy laws just to keep you happy?,"You keep me happy, I return the favor. Think of it as tat for tit."
"When we're at work, we need to focus on our work thoughts. Why are you wearing that?",It's my dressy casual. What do you think?
"You look like Wilson. It looks weird. Well, you knew I'd think that. Which makes me wonder why you look disappointed.","If you prick me, do I not bleed?"
"You knew I wouldn't like it, but you thought I would say I did. That's what this is about. You're trying to trap me into lying to you.",You sure? 'Cause that sounds so juvenile.
Taub was right. He just didn't know why.,It's locked.
I'm busy!,I'll wait.
I really am busy.,"Cuddy got me the daughter's file. Well, not Cuddy exactly. Her signature. Well, not exactly her signature."
Another lie?,Thought you could take a look at it for me.
Maybe you hadn't heard. I'm kind of busy.,With what?
Sudoku. What do you think? I'm the head of oncology at a major hospital.,And yet these files are not from this hospital. These are from where-my-fiancee-works memorial.
"Sam's boss is doing a clinical review of all of her files, and she just wanted to make sure Everything was in order before he starts on Monday.",Which explains why Sam is too busy to look at my file.
"If I don't help her, she can't go to the wedding and! We fell in love at her cousin's wedding, which is why I want to propose to her at a wedding. And now you have 60 seconds to berate me for that and for helping my girlfriend with her homework.","You don't want to propose at a wedding. Emotions running high, people on edge. You ought to try somewhere like a Buddhist temple or an aquarium. Or a Buddhist aquarium. That only took ten seconds. You can spend the rest of the time on my file."
Leg pain and Pseudobulbar Affect. He's feeling one emotion while unknowingly expressing another one.,"Classic Neurohecatia. Two days of anticholinergics, you'll be walking out of here."

He hasn't had hallucinations.,"I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about ""him"" with a capital ""o-m-g."""
"Hears voices, thinks he's the son of God. PRobably SParkzophrenic.",I think you offended him.
A neuro disorder could explain all his delusions.,Get an MRI of his brain. Let's see if we can find God.
Heard you got the daughter's file. Patient change his mind?,I forged your signature.
Thank you for your honesty.,"Think of it as a present. See, somebody is about to turn the big 4-5 in sEveral months, and somebody else wants to make a very big deal of it."
4-3.,4-3. Are you sure?
Very.,"How could I make such a mistake? In reading your HR file? Oh, no, wait, I didn't. And boom goes the dynamite. Scores are tied. We are Even-Steven."
"You're right. I did lie. To HR. Not to you. When I first applied for the VP Admin job, I was 29 years old. I knew I would be taken more seriously if I were",You lied to make yourself older? Are you lying about being a Woman?
"Even if you can trap me, you think I'll suddenly embrace the value of lying?",My point is you already have. I just need to prove it.
"And now we're feeding him, so they're both back.",How are you feeling?
Terrible.,Obviously. Where are your friends? Still casting lots for your clothes?
All I ask is that they pray for me.,"Always sacrificing. Very inspirational. The lesions are in your temporal lobes. When those areas get messed with, people have strange experiences ï¿½ like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives."
Deals with God? You didn't come to see if I was better. You came to see if your medicine has turned me into an atheist.,I'd settle for agnostic.
Faith is not a disease.,"No, of course not. On the other hand, it is communicable, and it kills a lot of people."
I can't move my arm.,You feel that?
You feel that?,Your friends are not praying hard enough.
"Could be an AVM, cerebral infarction.",Let's put it to the vote. Vest or cummerbund?
Cummerbund.,You know me. I can't say no to any of you guys. You're all correct. He has M.S. But not the friendly Mr. Rogers M.S. This is the weird guy in the panel van kind.
Marburg M.S.?,What did I just say?
He'll be dead in two to three days at the most.,"That's unless we can get someone to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible. Or, stem cell treatment."
It would be if it wasn't embryonic stem cell treatment. Our Patient's right of the pope. He's nEver gonna consent to that.,"I know that, and you know that. He doesn't know that. But now she knows that, he's gonna know that. Way to go."
"I know that, and you know that. He doesn't know that. But now she knows that, he's gonna know that. Way to go.",Confirm Marburg. Then see if he's a fair-weather flagellator.
Confirm Marburg. Then see if he's a fair-weather flagellator.,"You look smashing, Miss Moneypenny."
"The daughter's case checks out. Stereotactic biopsy confirmed stage IV Glioblastoma Multiforme. Doesn't respond to chemo, but they gave it to her anyway as a hail Mary and just got lucky.","So either God intervened, which is a lazy explanation, or we just don't know why. Which is no explanation."
Sometimes there is no explanation. And I'm just fine with that.,Which annoys me to no end.
"I need that file, that chair, and that desk.","Your Woman is fudging the facts. Five of those cases, the stated doses don't explain the radiation damage."
Sensitivities vary.,Not that much.
Yeah. That's what I thought. I asked her point blank about this. She said the dosages were accurate and that she had done nothing wrong.,"'Cause morally she didn't. All five Patients were terminal. She exceeded the dosing protocols to try to save their life. You would have done the same. She's a sap, and she's perfect for you."

No fault divorce in New Jersey requires couples to live at least 18 months apart. I'm actually only giving it a few weeks.,Oh. Thought I was supposed to be the dark one.
Not today.,Yeah.
Yeah.,You're gonna have to go stag. My Patient is refusing treatment.
And you care?,No. But it's an excuse you can't argue with.
Accepting this treatment is an insult to God. I can't expect him to keep our deal.,You already broke it. Your blood test showed you were loaded with ibuprofen.
Taking painkillers breaks my deal?,"The point is to suffer like your savior did, right? Well, he didn't take myrrh, the Tylenol of ancient Rome. And his nails went through his wrists, not through his palms. Palms are for sissies. And what about the 39 lashes and the beatings and the crown of thorns? What you go through is closer to a bad Manicure than a crucifixion."
"It's not about showing God my pain. It's about showing him my faith. If he asks me to die for my daughter, I'll do it gladly.","Don't make this about your daughter. You're just worried that if we find a cure, that it'll cost you your faith. And then you'll be like the rest of us."
"You can prescribe a lot of things, but hope isn't one of 'em.",Sticking by your convictions and damning the consequences. You two have a lot in common. You're both idiots.

Ugh. I hate weddings.,It won't be long now. You'll be staring down the yawning void before you know it.
You came from a wedding to tell me that?,Nope. I came from a wedding to run a PET scan.
I thought you'd given up on me.,I have. PET scan was for your daughter. I was wrong about her. She did have glioblastoma. And she still does. The cancer nEver went away.
"Yes, it did. They tested her Every year. With a CT scan.","Which misses all the tiny, little tumors that a PET scan doesn't."
You've made a mistake. She does not have cancer anymore.,I ran it twice. No mistake. Looks like God broke your deal. I'm sorry. But I'm also right.

He has to.,"Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it?"
He will.,"Well, that's why I'm so confused by this. This is your MRI. Shows incremental improvement. You're getting better. I double-checked the name on this one. But it's not all good news. This Patient is screwed. Technical term is dead as a doornail."
Who is that?,"God. You broke your deal with him, your daughter's fine, you're getting better. Nothing bad happened. Which can only mean one thing. There is no God. Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face."
"God. You broke your deal with him, your daughter's fine, you're getting better. Nothing bad happened. Which can only mean one thing. There is no God. Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face.",You're smiling. I assume that means you're miserable.
It means I'm happy. It doesn't mean God doesn't exist. It just means he's-he's truly merciful. My beautiful Marisa was right. God is all about love.,"Punishment is proof of God, and no punishment is proof of God? Ingenious argument."
Everyone else knew?,Everyone I could trust. So yes.
"If you had told me, he'd be dead by now. So why do I still want to tell the truth?",Either you're naÃ¯ve or you have scruples. I'm not sure which is worse.
This is insane. We can't work like this.,I can.
Good work today. I don't Even think your Patient's gonna sue. It looks like Everybody's happy.,"I've been an idiot. I got this argument stuck in my head. If Everybody lies, then trust is not only unfounded and pointless, it's fictional. But trust is not an argument that can be won or lost. Maybe I just have to suspend my cynicism and beliEve. Maybe it's time I took a leap of faith. I'm sorry. I won't lie to you again."
Sam left me.,What a moron.
Too soon. I'm still in love with her.,I meant you.
Do you have a drink? Or drinks?,Cuddy's coming over.
Does she know you're here?,I apologized to her.
Good for you.,Not really. I lied. I just took your advice. Too bad you didn't.
The guy did a wonderful thing. Can't we just take that at face value?,You are adorable. Heroism does exist.
What about the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?,"News flash ï¿½ that guy was already on the plane. For all we know, he would have killed Everyone else on board if it increased his chances. Faced with almost certain death, a normal person rides the pine."
What about firefighters?,The guys who undergo months of training to deny their own instincts for self-preservation?
"Pediatrician appointment for an s-h-o-t. Waldenwood insists vaccination reports go in with the application. Honey, finish your oatmeal.",Waldenwood. Is that by any chance a boarding school? Or a work camp?
It's our first-choice preschool.,Blocks made of gold! Kids don't have to pick their own noses!
Great facilities and teachers. And they're known for their gifted program.,You sure that's the right place for her? Sounds a little snobby.
Is no one gonna tell me!,Shh-shh-shh.
She needs a doctor.,"Yes, just not me. Your mom is a 65-year-old Woman with high blood pressure."
What about the macrocytic anemia?,"Borderline, which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which, by the way, matches the rest of her medical history."
You really think she's psyParkng herself into atrial fibrillation?,"So get her a cardiologist. You don't want me involved. You don't want you involved. All that ethics stuff that I don't give a crap about suddenly makes sense. If you're emotionally invested, you cannot make rational decisions. You know this would be a disaster."
This is my mother.,"Treadmill test went well ï¿½ no chest discomfort or ischemia. The abnormal rhythm will pRobably resolve itself, and if not, a daily pill will keep it under control. I will follow up later today."
"Aye! Not her fault. This ""Dean of Medicine"" stuff ï¿½ very impressive at parties. But she's forgotten how to be a real doctor. It's all in my file.",There are 15 years of clinic visits in this file.
I don't want to be a bother. But isn't this what you do for a living?,"So! we're looking for a disease that can last a decade and a half, causes constipation, diarrhea, flu, cold, dizziness, rashes, back and joint pain, ""heart feeling weird,"" ""kishkes feeling wobbly,"" one actual hip replacement. And which has eluded detection by years of blood work, X-rays, and MRIs. Well, one thing does pop to mind."
It means we might have an actual case.,"Mexican herbal medication for stomach pRoblems, but only in the sense that lead chromate is an herb and poison is a medication."
"I'll start a chelation I.V. Thank you so much. That wasn't too much of a disaster, was it?",You know! that's not the only thing they found in her home.
Not my yearbook!,"Nope. Just some stuff that could cause sEvere nausea and perManent erectile dysfunction! and which proves that your mom is doing the help. According to her diary, it's some contractor named Jesus! which, granted, was originally a Jewish name, but!"
He shouldn't have broken your nose.,"You know, texts, calls, and emails all go to the same magic device these days. You only got to send one."
Then it's Even weirder it took you so long to get down here.,"Yeah, that's a crazy mystery. It's not like I got a department to run."
This other magic device tells me that lead poisoning wouldn't cause all my symptoms.,True. But it could cause the 5% that are real.
You think I'm a hypochondriac?,"Well, let me answer this wayï¿½ maybe you're imagining that I think you're a hypochondriac."
"Look, my hand just started to shake. It's a side effect of these arthritis pills. Read the label.","I did! when I was typing it up, right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills."
You printed a fake label! just to prove I'm a hypochondriac?,Did it work?
"An hour to convince her to go with Dr. KaufMan, and only then because he runs internal medicine. She wanted to leave the hospital entirely.","My God, a Woman getting better wants to leave the hospital?"
"If she's getting better, it's not because you made her feel like a fool.","It couldn't be more because. If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself with six new forms of cancer. She'd nEver leave."
I'll be right there. A-fib's at 170.,Wait. I'm sorry she's sick. I'm not sorry I'm off the case.
You're not off the case.,You don't think you can convince herï¿½
"No, no. You are staying on. She just can't know about it.","Top of the morning, Dr. KaufMan. Here's the deal. You copy me"
No.,I thought you spoke to Cuddy.
"Yeah. Then I spoke to the elder Cuddy, who specifically requested you not be involved.","Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent, bordering on good, Even. But you know I'm better. If you want, we can pretend it's 'cause I got a team and more resources. Either way, it'd be crazy to ignore my advice."
You bugged the room?,"I absolutely, without apology, will admit that someone may have allegedly done so."
Guess we can pass unethical and skip straight to illegal.,Not according to the recent Supreme Court case of bite versus me.
"If you want gloomy and unable to commit, then stick with the goyishe one.",This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?
"I know I'm a pain, but it's impossible for me to work with you if youï¿½","Fine, fine! Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later ï¿½ thank you for saving America."
Sounds good.,Yeah. I was really hoping for a different diagnosis ï¿½ one that KaufMan hadn't already come up with. He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.
So we don't need to do anything.,"I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case. Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!"
"I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case. Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!",DDX.
"Um, we just did it.","No, we just did the fake one. Why do you think I let the truth fairy know about the bug? I was testing her. She failed. She's still a narc. Thiamine deficiency fits better than leukemia."
You think she's an alcoholic?,"I had dinner with Arlene. I mixed her a gin and tonic. And I'd run out of the tonic, so I substituted sleeping pills. Next morning, she assumed the blackout was from the drinking. How Many old ladies are used to passing out from boozing? The answer is the boozers. We're gonna have to slip her the thiamine pills."
We've got to run this by Cuddy.,Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?
Alcoholic?,"Treatment's very easy, safe. It's literally a few vitamin pills. It'll fix her heart, and it won't interfere with the biopsy KaufMan's running. Put 'em in an antacid bottle. Just tell her it's for stomach pRoblems."
I have to ask her about this.,"Of course. Absolutely. You'll ask. She'll deny. You'll push it. She'll get offended. You'll be exactly where you are now, except it'll be harder to treat. You've absolutely got to do that."
I don't think she'll lie to me.,She just spent the last five years going south of the border down Mexico way.
"We have our issues, but since Dad died, we tell each other the truth when asked directly. It's important to us.",Addicts lie.
"If something like that comes up again, just! do what you need to do.",And keep you out of it?
She spiked a fEver. It's 102.,That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.
You were wrong about the alcoholism.,True dat. It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.
KaufMan rushed the biopsies. It's not cancer.,So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.
So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.,DDX.
Okay! What disease can turn Cuddy's mother into a coma Patient named Stewart?,Lupus? We got fired from that case. We're moving on.
We were already fired.,"By the Patient. This time by Cuddy, so it's real. She somehow realized that her completely unworkable system was completely unworkable. Okay, pop quiz, hot shots ï¿½ I chose vegetable Stew for a reason. You got 60 seconds, no ""hintsies."""
You're not gonna talk to us?,Exactly. You're gonna have toï¿½ Hey! You're good.
I'll do a blood draw and put glutethimide on the tox screen.,Really? You thought that case was interesting?
Aren't there other ways of keeping Masters occupied?,Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.
"Maybe it's not hypochondria. She said she gets a lot of rashes. Add the fEver ï¿½ sounds like autoimmune, S.L.E.","Congratulations, you can think exactly like a semi-competent internist. KaufMan's starting her on prednisone. But the heart pRoblems were first."
With no murmurs?,It's usually a late sign.
Echo showed pristine valves.,Below the resolving threshold.
You got to tell him it's endocarditis.,Check the wiretap. His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him. He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?
So what do we do?,"We switch her meds. We get a solution of broad-spectrum antibiotics, stick it in an I.V. bag marked for prednisone. KaufMan can only be there a few times a day. Tell Arlene you're from the pharmacy, switch 'em out."
This is nuts. This is way too compliCated.,It's hanging an I.V. bag!
"If the attending doesn't know what she's on, the risk of drug reactionï¿½",What risk? We know how he's treating her. We bugged the room.
This is not about information! We're talking ethical and legal violations on a scale that should make Even you puke!,She's dying!
You gonna run this by Cuddy?,"No. She said to keep her out of it, do what we need to do. Look, I know what I'm suggesting is completely screwed up. That's because this situation is completely screwed up. Do it, or you're fired."
"Timothy, we're gonna go see the doctor.","Another pop quiz. How Many idiot doctors does it take to switch an I.V.? The longer we wait, the more the prednisone is gonna kill her immune system. Forget playing pharmacist. Mom naps Every afternoon. Wait by the room. When she falls asleep, get the sister out somehow."
"Because I-I'm worried that he's switParkng your mother's medications. I checked with the pharmacy ï¿½ Dr. Chase got prednisone and antibiotics for my coma Patient, which wouldn't treat him, but could treat conditions that cause! heart failure.","You told me to keep you out of it, do what I needed to do. What the hell did you think that meant?"
"I meant, like, if you had to slip her a few more vitamin pills or something. This is life-threatening! It's illegal. I wasn't expecting something like this.",Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it 'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.
Are you completely sure it's endocarditis?,That's not a real question. Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives. We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V. The fastest way is with you help.
Allergy's got to be due to our antibiotics.,Does KaufMan know what we did? That's good.
"No, that is terrible! He doesn't know that she got worse on antibiotics, so now he's thinking endocarditis. He'll put her back on the antibiotics that almost suffoCated her. What do we do?",We push through this. It started in the heart. Endocarditis still fits. It's just got to be fungal. We have to switch KaufMan's antibiotics for amphotericin B.
I don't know if you're right. I don't care. But we are gonna end up killing this Woman if we keep confusing her attending with these secret meds.,I don't care about confusing the attending! I want this Womanï¿½
"We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore. Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself. It's a poison. That's why it kills fungi. It'll give her fEver, Parkllsï¿½","Which she already has, which will help us hide it."
I don't think I can take a risk like that.,"Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me! Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again."
I'm so sorry I got you guys into this. You should go.,I'm right.
"I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits. But we still have to tell your mother. I don't want to tell her, not at all. But the Patient is the highest priority.","I'm kicking you out of your office. Yes, you. This is not her office yet. If you tell anyone, I will get you thrown out of med school, and I will destroy your career."
I've thought about that. Lying about me! won't work. Everybody knows your reputation.,"True! but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives."
Wait!,You drew blood. And that's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.
But you told meï¿½,No. As you may recall!
You set me up? Why?,Because this Patient is the highest priority.
"I'm skipping the credentials committee. I'm going straight to the state board and reporting you for ï¿½ what you've done is so off the spectrum, I don't know there's a specific name for it.",I think he's talking to you.
I'll get the ambulance.,Happy?
I can't beliEve it. What just happened?,You just killed her.
"Are you blaming me? This is all because you're so arrogant, you goaded her into firing you!","Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it."
She would have left the hospital.,"Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now."
You think I can control her?,I don't know. I've nEver seen you try.
I have been rebelling against this Woman my entire life.,"Here's what I've seen. She insults you, you complain to me. I drug her at dinner, you nEver let her know. We slip her medicine, happens behind her back. You nEver confront her! and it pisses me off."
Are you taking this personally?,"She leaves, she dies. One day! maybe a week from now, maybe a year from now, you're gonna decide that the Man sleeping next to you killed your mother. Get me my Patient back."
I feel a little dizzy.,Your heart's still weak from the infection. We'll hang an antifungal I.V.
That's what he told me.,"Two days ago? I said that I didn't have a department to run, I was being sarcastic."
"No, you weren't.","Right, because people who are talking can't tell if they're being sarcastic."
That doesn't make any sense. Of course they can. But you weren't.,I love A-Rod. He's soooo modest. And I highly respect the paintings he has of himself as a centaur. Question ï¿½ do I like A-Rod?
She can't recognize sarcasm?,"Deficit in the right parahippocampal gyrus, which means CNS involvement before the fEver. I was wrong about the endocarditis."
Mom? Mom! Heart rate 170. Nurse! Do something.,I am.
House!,"The fEver was hypothalamic. That means brain, heart, anemia, allergy. You hear that, what do you think?"
I don't know.,You think heavy-metal toxicity.
It can't be. You treated with chelation for lead.,"She got better, then she got worse. She nEver stopped being poisoned."
What are you doing?,You really want me to stop and explain? There it is. Look at that.
The muscle's black. Necrosis?,"Metallosis. Her artificial hip ""weared and teared"" way too much. It's cobalt poisoning. We need Chase to get an O.R. I'm gonna start chelation again."
Chris! you were a crappy husband! but you are a good person.,"Once again, you are unfired."
Why?,You sold me out Even though you knew that you were gonna get thrown out of med school. That's just! kind of impressive.
I keep my job if I stand up to you. I keep it if I don't. I! don't buy it.,"When Cuddy was protecting me before, she was protecting a doctor. She's now protecting a boyfriend. The hospital's not gonna put up with that for long. So I need you to protect me from doing something Cuddy will regret. See you bright and late tomorrow."
I can't move my legs!,"Picture a door. Unlocked with the key of the mind. Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last."
That actually makes no logical sense.,"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!"
"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!","Something I can't remember. You'll see the irony in a second. Presenting with temporary paralysis, high CK lEvels, and a perfect memory."
How perfect is perfect?,"Perfectly perfect. Hyperthymesia. Complete recall of Every moment of Every day since puberty. All 7,600,049 of them. It's cool, huh? One of only a handful of recorded cases."
So we have two symptoms: Temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.,Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition 'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover. There's a third symptom.
Hyperthymesia is known to Manifest in adolescence.,"Yeah, in the whole five documented cases."
She's a waitress. They're no strangers to botulism or alcoholism. We should search the diner and where she lives.,"Or you could search her brain. You know, where her memory lives. Save the gas. You two check her home. You two get a complete Patient history. We'll see who gets an answer first."
You said there's a second case?,Oh! Yeah. Thanks.
Oh! Yeah. Thanks.,The case of the 45-year-old doctor who just failed his pathology recertification exam and is going to lose his board certification and get fired.
I was recovering from the flu. I'm retaking it next week. It's not an issue.,"Normally, I'd let Darwinism run its course. But Cuddy's in a big tizzy about her poster boy getting canned. So, how are we gonna get the short guy off the short bus?"
I don't need a tutor.,"Tutor it is. Choose your poison. Chase, if you prefer pounding Aussie beers and commiserating over the suckiness of divorce. Masters, if you want nervous energy, flash cards, and obnoxious pieces of arcane trivia. Foreman, if you need to be berated by a humorless hard-ass."
Foreman.,Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.
Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.,"I need a consult, Dr. Wilson."
Will do.,Who's Sarah?
"Her granddaughter, I think. Early stages of dementia. What's the consult?",I need your medical opinion on what bar we're gonna hit for happy hour tonight to kick off the official end to your three-month pity party over Sam.
I can't tonight.,Because of Sarah?
"Yes, because of my senile Patient's granddaughter. You caught me. I'm busy!",Who's Sarah? Wilson's friend.
My computer crashed. Lost my database of his acquaintances.,Or you're both lying to me.
I know nothing about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Satisfied?,Nooo.
Are laxatives vegan?,Hello?
Where are you?,"In the Parking garage, searParkng Wilson's car."
We found a pretty large stash of laxatives. Abuse can lead to hypermagnesemia.,I admit that's! impressively outside-the-box thinking. Hmm.
Everything okay?,"No. For a second I thought Wilson might have a drug pRoblem. Turns out it's much, much worse."
"Okay! Uh, so we push fluids and wait for her kidneys to clear the hypermagnesemia?","You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has. Her BP and respiratory rate are normal. While you two were so busy being impressively outside the box, you missed the actual box. Chase and Masters done yet?"
It's okay. Remembering something is not the same as understanding it. I'm not a genius. I love my job. I'm great at it. Keeps my mind busy.,"Hi. I'm Dr. House. You are not pooping. Question is, are you also a klutz?"
Uh! I guess I'm no clumsier than most people.,"What are you guessing for? You've got a perfect memory. I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks."
What do you want to know?,"Let's go back to 2008. How Many trips, stumbles, falls did you have?"
ElEven.,This really works. Cool. How 'bout 2009?
Twelve.,Even cooler. Last year?
That's a big spike in discoordination.,"If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's. Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa."
"Oh, I'm so surprised you broke into my apartment without telling me. What is this?","An intervention. Exhibit A. A baggie filled with nepeta cataria, also known as!"
That had better not be what I think it is.,"If you mean your new junkie girlfriend, then yes."
"Okay, fine. I got a cat. Release the Kraken.",I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.
I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.,"That cat, that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with Insulin and buying dime bags of catnip for, that means you've given up on Ever finding anyone."
Don't you think you're completely overreacting?,"If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?"
"Um, because I knew you would completely overreact.","Its name's Sarah. Cats aren't named that, women are. What the Freud is that about?"
"Look, I didn't name her. My neighbor did. She died, and I felt bad. Sarah would have been destroyed at the shelter.","Aww, who would want a cat that croaks if you're not home twice a day to shoot it up? It's like having your own button on Lost. You know, I'm pretty sure that there is a river nearby."
"We're back to transient paralysis and high CK, plus arrhythmia.","Masters, when you finally blossom into a Woman, would you Ever sleep with a Man who had a cat?"
Sure.,"Wrong, the answer is no. Slut. Any of you Ever had a cat? Any of you Ever had sex? I think, as your people say, quod erat demonstrandum."
"Maybe we're missing the obvious. The heart could be behind Everything. If it's not pumping effectively, the muscles shut down, CK elevates, coordination suffers. Why are you asking about cats?",Curiosity. Can we focus here?
She said they'd been estranged for over six years. That's a lot of tension.,Run a stress test to confirm long QT.
It'll have to be drug-induced. Treadmill will pull her stitches.,"Drugs are nEver the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister."
"Drugs are nEver the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister.",You lied to me.
"No. I said I didn't know anything about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Under House rules, that is not a lie. He's lonely. That cat is a nice way for him to get some affection.",That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from. He needs a putty tat he can tap.
Why is it so important to you?,"After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged Siamese. He stopped answering his phone, redecorated his place like Grey Gardens. He wasn't able to come back to huManity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open. How that cat opened the window, I will nEver know."
He just needs more time. Leave him and the cat alone.,I won't if you will.
Why are you giving me these?,"Because, while they're off running all these tests, you will be submitting the insurance forms."
There's an entire department for that.,"Exactly. The Foreman department. Of which you are the Foreman, Foreman. I know you got the time. A little Wallaby told me that you recently vaCated your post as Taub's savior."
He doesn't need a tutor. He needs Ritalin and a babysitter.,"Consider the forms incentive. Taub doesn't pass, he'll become a perManent part of your life."
"This isn't really about Cuddy, is it? It's about you. You don't want to lose me. I think you care.","Don't think you can disgust me into pulling Foreman off you. Pulse the Patient with steroids for the autoimmune. Start her on dialysis for the kidney failure. Treat the Taub with insults and small slaps for the obstinacy, and start him on studying for the brain failure."
You planted something in my apartment to make me think I'm allergic to Sarah.,"Paranoia is the first sign of toxoplasma gondii, the parasite linked to crazy cat lady disease."
I'm not paranoid. I'm allergic to ragweed and dandelion. I'm not allergic to cats. You're trying to gaslight me.,"Maybe your subconscious is afraid that you're gonna die alone. And it just comes out as gibberish and sneezing. Prove that I'm overreacting. Boys' night out. Good Time Charlie's. They just changed their slogan to, ""where the trashiest ladies"
"You do see the hypocrisy in all this, don't you? Until recently, your lifestyle of choice was self-exile.",But I nEver had a cat. Why don't you pick me up at 8:00?
Could be pulmonary edema from renal failure.,Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.
You think this is an allergic reaction? It can't be. We pumped her full of steroids.,"It can be. If it was a really, really bad one."
"It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.",I have good news and bad news. The good news is I was right about you having some autoimmune disease. You're just allergic to the dialysis.
"But if I can't have dialysis and my kidneys are failing, won't that mean I'll die?","Well, you figured out the bad news."
"That relationship was broken long before we got there. Nadia literally keeps score. She tallies Everything. She decided Elena's done more bad things to her than good, doesn't deserve her affection.","I'm sure she's right. Unlike Everybody else in the world, her memory seems to let her keep a pure and objective view of people in relationships. There's no petty"
'Cause it's making her die alone of kidney failure in room 205?,"Not necessarily. Nadia's sister's not like her. I'm sure she's got plenty of subjective emotions we can exploit. Why don't you go channel your guilt, see if you can get her to cough up a kidney?"
Me? I'm not good at that type of thing. Someone else should go.,Someone else didn't screw this up.
I didn't!,You were just obeying orders. Right? Go fix this.
No abdominal pain.,Did the Patient thank her sister?
"No. Not yet, at least.",See if she will.
What are you trying to find out?,"If she's telling the truth. She claims she objectively sees reality. Weighing the good and bad in people. If that's true, I don't care how Many times her sister borrowed her scrunParke without asking, a free kidney ought to trump all the bad stuff."
And if it doesn't?,That means she sucks like the rest of us.
"We haven't considered her blood. Clots could hit her leg, heart, kidney, and brain.",Factor 5 leiden. Easiest to treat if we're right. Start her on heparin. And ask for the thank you.
Can I see her?,"Too fat. Too thin. Too desperate. Not desperate enough. Come on, you can insult them too."
I'd rather not.,"If you objectify them now, you'll feel more comfortable when you! tie them to a table in your basement later. Or whatEver."
Okay. Um! Too armpit fatty.,Whoa! Too hot.
I actually know her. She's the new barista at my coffee shop. She's getting her Masters in finance.,Brains and boobs. The mother lode.
"Total moron as a barista, though. Every drink I order ends up with","Girlfriend, that means she's into you."
Okay.,"Hi, there. Wilson, Wilson. I'm a doctor. I'm hoping that's enough to close, because I'm also a social moron. And I have a cat."
She said my coffee is not the only thing she'd like to put whipped cream on.,"Yeah, but is she interested?"
"Yeah, but is she interested?",Bartender! Champagne for Everyone!
Thank you.,Do you know if that! O.R. nurse that Wilson liked Ever broke up with her boyfriend?
I thought your Wilson fetish was over.,I'm putting together a second string in case things don't go well with the well-breasted barista.
You've gotta let that guy alone.,He's not supposed to be alone.
Is that what this is about? You feel guilty because Wilson's the one that's alone and not you? You still don't think you deserve this.,Have you met me?
Your happiness doesn't take his away. It's okay to enjoy it.,Yeah.
"If it's hit her brain, that could mean she doesn't have long.","So then the question becomes, will the sister show up at the funeral?"
"She tried to reconcile, but the bad memories crowded out the good, and she ran.","Nobody's perfect. What else? Come on, the Woman has all the information we need. She's a bottomless diagnostic library."
"Yeah, it's all muscle strain from doing her hundreds of Jigsaw puzzles. We should do another MRI. A brain hemorrhage wouldï¿½",Hey. How Many puzzles?
"Okay, I was exaggerating. Dozens.",Do a peripheral blood smear. Look for acanthocytes. I'll be right in.
Do a peripheral blood smear. Look for acanthocytes. I'll be right in.,Remember me? Just kidding. So! jigsaw puzzles.
"Um, I find them calming.",You Ever left one unfinished?
"No, that would drive me crazy.",Speaking of!
Why are you doing that?,"More important question is, why are you?"
It's just a habit.,"It's a habit that compels you in an obsessive way, that's so bad, it's a disorder."
Each brain with OCD has its own way of filtering it. Some people wash their hands and hoard TV Guides. You do puzzles and hoard memories.,So what we thought was a gift! is just you literally obsessing over your own life.
"That's why I can't stop the memories, Even when I try. But Everything else? My kidneys?","Memory was just a symptom of a symptom of a larger disease. You have McLeod syndrome. It's a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, the blood. And can cause! OCD."
"It can't be cured. But your various symptoms can be Managed with medication. Best-case scenario, you can live another 20 years.","If it's any solace, Everybody dies alone. It pRobably isn't."
Ohh!,Hey.
Aah!,Those are for Sarah.
Are they poisoned?,"Poiï¿½ you and your paranoia. Now, if you'll excuse me!"
"Poiï¿½ you and your paranoia. Now, if you'll excuse me!",I really should find a better place to store my ragweed.
"It's a very nice gesture, but it's still in the apartment.","So! I wanna hear all the dirty, dairy-specific details of your night with java the slut."
"All right. First of all, all real. Second! a true connoisseur of the dark arts of! I flaked. I walked her to her car and said good night. I will get back into it, I ï¿½ you just need to give me a little more time.",I'll give you ten days.
Fine.,Ooh!
House? House? Oh! My God! What the hell?,Muahahahaaaaahhh Gotcha.
Did you actually wake up early and hide under the bed just to scare the crap outta me?,Set an alarm and Everything.
It's like dating a ten-year-old.,"God, I hope not. Now that we're down here!"
Hold that thought.,Seriously?
I have to pee.,I'll wait. I brought a book. I didn't know what time your alarm was set for.
House?,"You know, you can rent this space out down here. In Japan, that would be like a deluxeï¿½"
You really don't have to be here.,You're my girlfriend. I'm being supportive.
I'm mainly talking about them.,"Well, given that there's almost certainly nothing wrong with you, and my Patient definitely has something wrong with himï¿½"
That can't wait an hour?,'Fraid not. He's! Chase.
16-year-old male spit up blood during a pick-up basketball game. E.R. couldn't find the source in his lungs or GI tract.,See? Serious.
Get them outta here. My urethra is not for public entertainment.,But it is a good-time adjacent. Feed the kid a camera. Check his gut for angiodysplasia.
All right. If you could scoot down.,"Hey, I'm, uh, I'm missing a watch. So can you keep your eyes open whileï¿½"
Imaging showed no sign of upper GI issues. But the kid did admit to being depressed and to smoking pot to take the edge off.,"You are very pleased with yourself, aren't you?"
"His marijuana could be laced with formaldehyde or lead, which could cause a pulmonary hemorrhage which could make him spit up blood. Yes. Yes, I am. I thought it was a good catch.",Run a lead lEvel and push 5 liters IV fluid.
Feel free to tip your other server.,Cystoscopy was clean. Cytopathology was normal.
Why do you have my lab results?,"I don't. If I did, I'd know you were fine."
Unless the blood came from my kidneys.,"Come on. Your hypochondriac mom had a brush with mortality last month, and it's understandable that you're worrying more than usual, worrying that you might turn into her."
"You're right. Odds are, this is nothing.",Meet me in the cafeteria in ten. There'll be a corn dog with your name on it. I mean an actual corn dog. They fixed the deep fryer.
Gets a lot narrower if we factor in his depression.,"Oh, don't do that!"
Mood swings can be a symptom of physiological illness.,I'm not talking to you.
"Infection makes the most sense. He shoots hoops at school, showers in the locker room. I'm thinking staph.",Damn!
You don't thinkï¿½,Not talking to you!
Everything okay with Cuddy?,She's fine. She's just too stupid to accept it. Start him on nafcillin for staph.
"All that's in the, uh, First Mutual safety deposit box. The retirement accountsï¿½",You're freaking out because of one ultrasound performed by an incompetent Bonobo monkey.
As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly going about my business.,"Calling a Lawyer, drafting a will! Okay. I-I! hacked into your online schedule. Look, tests always show something. A mass in your kidney could be a complex cyst. It could be benign."
"I'm a single mom. I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian. It's silly that I haven't done it before now.",But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.
The biopsy's not till tomorrow. It's the first opening in the schedule.,"For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is! Oh, look! Now."
My worry isn't any more important than anyone else's.,"Actually, it is."
"But I'm not sick, right?",Good point.
I'll get it.,That better be her!
Mouth on that kid makes Mel Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela. Where'd she learn that?,"I don't know why you're here, but I didn't do it."
Are either of you this girl's father?,"Nope. But since her mom died, she's my favorite tax write-off. Officer, you have my word it won't happen again. 'Cause next time! she won't get caught!"
I'm not sure. I think I just peed blood.,Looks like peeing blood is the new black.
"Scoping showed no sign of a bleed in his bladder, which points to a kidney pRoblem.",PRobably some kinda mass.
"Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood or the hemorrhages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand!",Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.
You think it's cancer?,Mass doesn't have to be cancer. Could be renal hematoma.
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?,It's pRobably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.
And then you pointed out how sweet that was.,"If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the Patient on plasmapheresis."
"While he's doing that, can I at least search his House for drugs?",Have I Ever said no to that question?
Have I Ever said no to that question?,What are you doing here?
Pie-eating contest.,Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You should be keeping her company.
"Okay. You've been worried that your relationship is getting in the way of your diagnoses, you're protecting your Patient. Either that or! you're an ass.",Three ï¿½ I hate the smell of death.
The chances of Cuddy having renal cell carcinomaï¿½,"I'm talking about our relationship. She needs support and comfort, both things that I famously suck at. This will inevitably lead toï¿½"
You know what's good for that? Practice. Doing it ï¿½ I don't know ï¿½ once?,I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.
"There's no proof she's being stalked by Ninja squirrels either, but if she's scared of them! as her boyfriend, it's your job to figure out how to help her feel better.",You're right.
Look at this.,Chase? How'd it go with Cuddy? Chase?
Aah!,Good thing I brought my ax cane.
House! help me!,I'm coming!
House! please!,It looks like we got company.
House! Aah! aah!,No!
No!,Ah!
Are you okay?,I was sleeping. What could go wrong?
"So what causes bleeding, kidney pRoblems, and unilateral numbness?",And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.
"What if we had it backwards and it's not a bleeding pRoblem, it's a clotting pRoblem?",There's no Patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.
She backdated the file? That's very clEver.,Hands off. She's mine.
House. We're worried too.,How sweet. I'm not worried. I just wanna get the results so she can stop worrying.
"Okay, but in the meantimeï¿½",Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.
You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.,I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.
What are you doing?,Pie-eating contest.
"I was going to send Chase to tell you what the obvious right thing to do here is, but then I realized! if you were too stupid to know how stupid that was, you might miss the irony. You have to be with her.",Yeah. I get it. She needs artificial support for an artificial pRoblem. She's fine.
She doesn't sleep with Chase.,We don't know that. Hey! Eating pie in here.
House! I'm not gonna tell you a third time. Do not screw this up. Because I really don't wanna clean up the mess.,He's referring to the pie.
"Fourteen Patients with kidney biopsies. I tabulated them against their urinalysis results. Six men, three diabetics, one LCDD, one kid, two seniors, and by default, one! Cuddy. Uh! the biopsy was inconclusive. The mass is near the center of her kidney. They couldn't get a readable sample.",Means they'll have to remove the mass to know if it's cancer or not.
"The file says they're doing some imaging now, give the surgeon a better idea of what he's dealing with.",Can we order pizza? There's nothing in the fridge. At least not anymore. What's happening with the Patient?
"Angio showed a clot in a branch of his middle cerebral artery. Started him on streptokinase to break it up. Although! maybe we should have just played a few rounds of Savagescape 2: The REvenge, because that's obviously the best way to make someone feel better.","You keep talking like Wilson, your face will freeze like that."
"Honey, I'm home.",Just in time. Pot roast is ready.
Smells wonderful!,"I cured all my Patients, so I came home to spend time with Rachel."
Your LSATs? You're eight years old.,We've been studying together. It was supposed to be a surprise.
"Well, that's wonderful.",I think Rachel deserves a treat.
I'm not 29! You're not limping. This isn't possible. None of this is possible.,Girl can dream.
Got your scans back from today.,Yeah. Okay.
What's going on?,Imaging shows enhancing masses across multiple lobes of Cuddy's lungs.
That's what kidney cancer looks like when it metastasizes.,She's dead.
What was that thing?,I got a great idea where we should go.
I don't want to hear it.,You're gonna love it. Australia's Finest. There's a great karaoke bar in Newarkï¿½
I hate karaoke.,"They got Every ï¿½ Every song by Every Aussie artist. Midnight Oil, Men at Work, Olivia Newton John."
I do a mean version of Physical.,And the barbecue shrimp is amazing.
What about the fries?,Hot and salty and delicious. Talking about food made me hungry.
You had candy in my other dreams.,Means you're stressed at work. All dream symbols mean you're stressed at work. Or castration anxiety.
No. I was hoping! you'd figure out a way to handle all this. Maybe you can't because you're still a Parkld.,I can do better.
Ah!,I should have been here. Sorry.
House couldn't concentrate on the case before she was dying. You think he's gonna get in the game now?,"If you don't make it, I won't sleep with anyone for at least a month."
Make it two.,Bitch.
Hm.,Hi.
Hi.,"Guess who doesn't have cancer? Me. Also you. Actually, you for sure. Me!"
House.,Your tumor was benign. An oncocytoma. They cut it out. You'll be fine.
Then what was in my lungs?,"Once they ruled out cancer, I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics. So I had them test your blood, and your IGE lEvels were through the roof. Because the lung masses were an allergic reaction. So now you're off the antibiotics, your lungs should clear right up. I brought you something. Say hello to your tumor."
"Ugh! Wait. There are so Many things that I could be afraid of, and most of the time, I Manage to! lock them up behind doors. But this happens! all those doors just burst open. You just figured something out about your Patient, didn't you? Go. Do what you do.",Take him off the meds. He's got a staph infection.
You treated him for staph three days ago. It didn't work.,"Bacteria already in his system responded. But once a door's been busted open, more just keep coming."
I got that.,"For the cheap seats, an abscess is a gooey little cream puff of infection. PRobably burst when your little pride and homicidal joy took a hard foul."
"You took Vicodin. When you came to my hospital room that night, you were stoned.",How did you know?
How did I not know? How did I make myself forget for months that you're an addict? My subconscious was trying to tell me you could nEver get through this without drugs.,It was a one-time thing.
"It's not about the pills, House. It's about what they mean.",I was scared because I thought my girlfriend might die.
"No. You don't take Vicodin because you're scared. You take it so you won't feel pain. Everything you've Ever done is to avoid pain ï¿½ drugs, sarcasm! Keeping Everybody at arm's length so no one can hurt you.",As opposed to Everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?
"Pain happens when you care. Y-you can't love someone without making yourself open to their pRoblems, their fears. And you're not willing to do that.","I ca""ï¿½I came to be with you."
"But you weren't with me, not really.",I wanted to be.
That's not enough.,I can do better.
"I don't think you can. You'll choose yourself over Everybody else over and over again, because that's just who you are. I'm sorry.","No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't."
I thought I could do this.,Don't. Please don't.
I was about to ask you the same thing.,I'm fine.
Okay.,I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.
She did.,And that I'm back on Vicodin.
She told me you had taken a Vicodin.,And then I took a lot more. And so on.
But you're fine?,"Well, I'm not fine as in ""fine,"" but I'm fine as in ""you don't have to worry about me."""
"Because you cleared out your bank account, checked into a hotel, and started back on Vicodin?","Because I'm going to be fine as in ""fine"" very soon."
"Until that happens, are you sure Vicodin is the!",My leg hurts.
You've been able to handle the pain.,It's gotten worse.
Not physically worse.,Worse is worse. Pain doesn't discriminate. Neither do the pills. The Vicodin and the five-star pampering that I'm gonna get over the next few days should be enough to get me through it.
So you don't want to just avoid the issue. You want to avoid avoiding the issue. Sorry.,"Nothing is either as bad or as good as we think it is at the time. That's why T.O. mocks his opponents immediately after scoring. He doesn't wait till his friend shows up the next day to tell him to deal with it. Two weeks from now, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, my life will be back to its usual lEvel of crappiness. Till then, the only real issue is how much I'm gonna spend on hotel charges."
"Good morning, sir. I've got your deluxe breakfast for two.",Do I have to count the strawberries?
Don't worry. You can trust me with anything. Including your food.,"After he and I have sex, I'm gonna slit his throat and then disembowel him in the bathtub."
"Oh, no pRoblem. I'll cancel the morning maid service. Would you like me to have them clean up later when they come to turn down your bed?",Why didn't I meet you six months ago?
"Thank you very much. And if there's anything else I can do to make your stay here more enjoyable, just ring the concierge and ask for Carnell.",Eat fast. We're expecting company.
Okay. This might not be such a bad idea.,"What do you think he meant by ""anything""?"
Take some time for yourself. Relax.,"I know it's a figure of speech, to underline the ""anything."""
Maybe talk to someone?,Already scheduled.
Really?,I'm not an idiot. I know I need help.
"Okay. That's! great. I meant, like, a counselor.",I know.
But you meant a hooker.,Yeah. Baby steps.
ENG was normal. Means his inner ear isn't!,Morons.
It wasn't!,Whoa. Wait a second. The acoustics in here are beautiful. Morons! You say it.
Who was that?,Something Carnell got me.
It wasn't that ridiculous of a theory.,"Great theory. It's a ridiculous test. You can't give a standard balance test to a champion bull rider. If you're gonna test SuperMan's strength, you need a bigger barbell. Find one, make him lift it, then call me and tell me how high it got. And tell Cuddy that spying is for cowards."
That's not from the pipes. It's from your mouth.,"Can you pass me the, um!"
"Can you pass me the, um!",What took you so long?
"There's nothing wrong with his ears, but he's got blood in his sputum.",Doesn't answer the question.
We weren't avoiding you. It took us a little time to think up a diagnostic test no one's Ever thought up before.,Apology accepted.
It could be a tumor in a salivary gland. We should get a parotid biopsy.,"Oh, that's so cute. You're fighting over who's in charge."
GI bleed's more likely to explain the nausea and weakness.,Who's in charge?
"House, as long as you're not here, someone has to have the final!",Let me rephrase. Who's your daddy?
"Let me rephrase. You have to decide if you're gonna buck up, get out of bed, and do your job, or if you're gonna wallow in self-pity.","Those my only two choices? Or can I also point out the self-pity coming from you? You're just annoyed because when your relationship ended, no one gave a crap, including you."
That is not true in so Many ways.,"And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman. And, Foreman, no. Till the telephone gets uninvented, no one in that room needs more authority than I give them, and right now I give you the authority to scope his GI tract and biopsy his parotid. And you can pick up the phone."
"Wait, House, should we be more worried about you? Are you on Vicodin? Because if you are, you pRobably shouldn't be ordering procedures.",I am not on Vicodin. Do the tests. I have to see a Man about a hurdy-gurdy.
"Sclerae turned yellow. Did X-rays. Looks like there's a mass in his liver,","Making it, as they say, as tough to find as a hooker who can play the hurdy-gurdy."
"If you have a point, can you please!","It's an expression. Means it's tough, but apparently it can be done."
If we don't have any equipment!,You have eyes.
Not that see through stuff.,Obviously.
You want us to cut him open?,Only if you want to see what's wrong with him. Do you know Free Bird?
It's gone now.,It's a mass! And then it's not.
"You, uh, gonna introduce us?","Team, meet Duke."
Anke.,Anke? How'd I get Duke?
"House, how Many prostitutes have you had?",As in eaten? Ever? This year?
Slept with. Since you've been here.,"All but one. She did my taxes. On the other hand, tapeworm that burrowed"
We would have seen eggs on a fecal smear or systemic eosinophilia.,Detached cyst?
Couldn't migrate that far in one hour. We haven't been sitting on our hands just waiting for your brilliance to kick in.,"Okay, so how did you shoot down intermittently swollen lymph node?"
What about a ventricular puncture?,Sounds good.
You think sticking a needle directly into his brain would be less dangerous than sticking it in his spine?,"It's pRobably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet, stuff is going on."
"It's pRobably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet, stuff is going on.",Just pick a spot and stick a needle in it.
Please don't.,That is a nice bow.
That was a nice door.,Put it on my tab. Let's say we take it up a notch.
"Yeah, right. Very funny.",You don't trust me?
No.,And we have a gamer.
"Oh, come on, Man. You can't be serious.","Why not? Anything goes wrong, we just take her to the doctor. And I'm only eight paces away."
House!,"I like you, Carnell. Don't ruin it. Stinky feet can point to diabetes, athlete's foot, or gangrene! Pick one."
No. No. No. No. You're gonna kill her.,"Don't do that, Carnell. They might get the idea that I'm shooting at a hooker. Fungal infection can cause ulceration between the toes and bleeding could be from recurring abscesses that appear to be recurring masses."
So's MRI'ing his heart. He's got a sEven-centimeter conductive metal rod holding his rib together. It'll rip him in two.,"No, it'll just feel like it's ripping him in two, which is much better."
"Oh, God!",Oops. Got to go.
Call an ambulance!,Why?
What do you mean why? She's hurt!,She doesn't look hurt.
"No, you didn't.","Yes, we did."
You're an ass.,"Okay. Go get me, uh, general Patton's colt 45. The one with the two notches."
"You were bored. You must have spent about two days setting up a fake murder, and you were bored.",I'm fine.
You're not. And I'm worried you might do something Even stupider. Why don't you move back in with me? At least until you get back on track.,What an ego. You think you're some sort of emotional paragon? You're my rock?
I'm trying to be a friend.,At least I have the good sense not to marry Every Woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.
Either way. If you prefer!,I prefer you to stop talking about this.
"House, we haven't Even started talking about this except to establish the fact that you are fine, which clearly you aren't.",Leave me alone!
"No. We are gonna talk about this, and we're gonna deal with this.","So I have no choice? Fine. Unless! unless! Yes, I do. I do have legs. I see you didn't factor those into your brilliant plan."
You can't go backwards. I can't fix his pRoblem. I am his pRoblem.,"If the infection's not in his heart, then it's in his brain. You're in my sun. Do a CT."
We can't. He has a titanium plate and a bunch of metal screws.,So get rid of them.
His skull has multiple hairline fractures. Removing the metal plate will be like removing half an eggshell without cracking the rest of the shell.,And not removing the plate will be like leaving the egg out to rot.
We can't cut off the top of his head based on a few symptoms that disappear whenEver we try to test for them.,"What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared was nEver actually there? Any delays when he answers questions? He doesn't have partial hearing loss. He's missing moments. He reported having something like a complex partial seizure during a bull ride. Said it hasn't happened since, but what if he's wrong? What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?"
His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.,I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.
And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove!,"Nope, 'cause I already got one."
You want me to sing? How's singing My Bonnie gonna help you see inside my brain?,"It won't. It's just gonna prove that we need to cut into your skull, which is gonna be kind of dangerous. So you've got a real incentive to sing like an angel."
"We think you're having mini blackouts, but your brain compensates.","It can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm. One, two, three."
"Lane, that wasn't Even close. That was brilliant.",Yeah.
It's understandable.,"I hate when you do that. You respond to what you think I'm thinking, because you think that I think like you do. It's insulting and annoying."
"You're scared because nothing excites you. Fun doesn't excite you. Puzzles don't excite you. What's left? And I was saying you're right. You're upset. You're depressed. Everything's gonna taste a little worse right now, but it'll pass.","It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting."
"It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting.",Yeah.
"House, there's no infection in this guy's brain. CT's clean.","Well, that sucks. Now we have to blow up his heart."
"We're not blowing up his heart, because we've ruled out his heart. MRI and transesophageal echo rEveal no swelling, no masses, no vegetation, no sign of anything.",'Cause we're looking the wrong way. There's an imperfection. How do you find where?
I don't know. Get a magnifying glass and!,"You suck. Feel free to interpret that both ways. Suck on the straw, see where the drink leaks."
You're saying we put pressure on his aorta until it rips open? You do realize the downside of that?,"If we don't rip it, the damage from the infection will, pRobably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R. where it can be repaired inside the 60 seconds it'll take him to bleed to death."
It's a ridiculous idea. It won't work.,Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.
Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.,"Hey. We think you have a Bartonella infection, which caused a mycotic aneurysm in your aortic wall. We need to find it, which means we need to blow up your heart. And, yes, I'm as serious as a heart attack. We're going to increase your blood pressure until the weak spot in your aortic wall explodes. Hopefully we'll be able to fix it before you bleed to death. Any questions?"
Nope.,Really? You don't Even want to know if you'll be able to go back to bull riding?
"I assume no? I mean, you've already cracked open my skull, and now you're gonna blow up my heart.",Thought you loved those eight seconds.
"You didn't expect me to say yes to rupturing his aorta, did you?","Since I didn't ask, I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all."
You have no reason to beliEve this will save his life.,"Really? No reason? None at all? I'm just planning on cracking open his chest, blowing up his heart, what, to pad his bill? Or you think that since you broke my heart I want to break his."
I don't know. I think maybe you're looking for something that can excite you. Fill a void. And it's affecting your judgment.,"You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way."
"You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way.",Annnnnd! she caves.
Heart looks good. The aorta's exposed.,I take it you ratted me out to Cuddy.
I think your judgment is compromised.,"No, you don't. Come on. I got a squash game at 2:00. Let's give this cowboy a ride."
"If I inject more, there won't be any room for the blood to go through the rest of his body.",You're right. Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes while we blow up his heart.
I was wrong.,Not yet.
"It worked!?! House, it worked.",I heard you.
"That would pRobably be inappropriate, 'cause I'm your doctor and Everything. Good luck with Everything. It!",Double scotch. Doubled.
"Uh, blended? Single malt? Any preference?",No.
Noooooooooooooo!,Cannonball!

23-year-old homeless Man brought into the E.R. with burn injuries and!,Let me guess! diagnosis was fire.
"He said his burning flesh smelled like licorice, and the E.R. antiseptics like blueberry muffins.","Cool. Dysosmia! could be anything from an environmental factor to an early sign of a degenerative brain disease. Smells like a winner. Okay, you and Chase go check out the Park where they found him. You two load him up with Prednisone, give him an odor I.D. test. If he's still mistaking his body odors for candy, the pRoblem's definitely in his brain. Also, find out what else he's lying about! Since I'm assuming ""Ferris Bueller"" is not his real name."
They say he's a righteous dude.,"Before I forget, I want you to meet Dominika. She's about to become a perManent member of Team House."
Doing what exactly?,Me. We're getting married on Friday. Mount up!
I don't think that two people are supposed!,"Living on the edge, baby doll!"
You can't ride that thing in here.,"Speaking of things, I'm having one on Friday. If you want to drop by, we'd love to have you. No pressure."
You're still standing on it.,So I am. Perhaps you're not familiar with New Jersey handicap ordinances.
"Or perhaps I am. They apply to wheelchairs and powered scooters only, not toys.",Have you any idea how much this toy cost?
I don't care.,"For some reason, my leg's been hurting a lot this week."
"For some reason, I still don't care.",Fine. I'll return it.
Fine. I'll return it.,But I'll have to walk it out of here.
Congratulations on your engagement.,I hear a strange voice.

You're trying to screw with Cuddy.,"Yeah, it's the classic ""You dumped me, so I'm gonna get married a week later"" ruse. 'Cause not only is she that stupid, but apparently I'm that stupid."
"And what, you're openly mocking marriage! trying to prove it means nothing?",It doesn't. But you proved that yourself years ago.
"I'd love to keep guessing, but I've got people with tumors waiting. Why do you want us to think that you're getting married?",Only one theory left! I am. Dominika needs a green card.
So you're just doing some random stranger a favor? It's illegal. People go to jail for that! Pay huge fines.,"Have you seen me practice medicine? You know how much it costs to have a live-in maid, personal assistant, cook, massage therapist, whore? I do. She's willing to work four days a week for free. It's gonna save me about $33,000."
"Have you seen me practice medicine? You know how much it costs to have a live-in maid, personal assistant, cook, massage therapist, whore? I do. She's willing to work four days a week for free. It's gonna save me about $33,000.","All I have to do is say two stupid words! ""I do."""
And if she doesn't see it this way?,"Iron-clad prenup! We go our separate ways. Your stunned look, I take it, is your way of saying, ""Brilliant idea, House."""
"Danny may have lied about his name, but he was telling the truth about the vials. Tests confirm they were vitamin A and B12.",He also enjoys vitamin H. The kid's a junkie.
Tox screens were negative for drug use.,"His hair wasn't. I had it tested! 'Cause unlike Santa and the Easter Bunny, homeless, non-mentally ill 20-somethings without drug pRoblems don't exist. He was a heavy user sometime in the last five months."
"No, thank you. I like a Man with the big, strong, sexy feet.","He really puts the ""Mani"" in the ""pedi."""
"House, you buying this?",Not usually. But this guy's been sleeping on a bed of dog poop. I wouldn't be surprised if he's got six different symptoms for six different reasons.
The bleed could be caused by a G.I. obstruction.,"Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat. Give him Tocopherol and zinc supplements for the excess vitamin A. If we're right! he could go homeless tomorrow."
"And if we're wrong, his intestines could get further distressed, while we ignore the G.I. obstruction.","See what happens when women don't have to serve men to stay in the country? The get all uppity. This is why we invented green cards. Go X-ray the guy's abdomen, if it'll make you feel all equal."
"See what happens when women don't have to serve men to stay in the country? The get all uppity. This is why we invented green cards. Go X-ray the guy's abdomen, if it'll make you feel all equal.",I need a favor. I want to add my fiancee's name to my health insurance a few days early. She wants to get a tooth capped before the big day.
I'm not signing this.,"I agree. I think she looks beautiful the way she is. Oh, no, wait. You're not signing that for moral reasons?"
"I agree. I think she looks beautiful the way she is. Oh, no, wait. You're not signing that for moral reasons?",You're declaring yourself the sole arbiter of true love? 'Cause you covered Taub's wife for years.
It's fraud.,Voydi moya malishka
Voydi moya malishka,"She wanted me to bribe you, like they do back in the old country. Tell her what I said."
This is America! the land of the home and the free of the braves.,"Yeah, I just get teary-eyed Every time I hear her say that. She brought you a gift."
Almond kulich! I make with own hands. I-it's delicious.,Almond kulich! How can you say no to that?
"You realize if I do sign this and you don't get legally married, you'll lose your insurance with our carrier?",Yes.
Thank you.,"North, Miss Teschmacher!"
And no larvae or eggs were observed in any of his stool samples.,Which is kind of surprising for a homeless junkie living in a Park.
He's just telling you what you want to hear.,"Once an addict, always an addict."
Can you! please not do that in front of me?,"Doubt it. You're the main reason I'm on the stuff. We could be looking at fungal masses hanging off the walls of his colon. Start him on Amphotericin ""B"" tonight, and in the morning, run a scope up where the sun don't shine, see if you can find any truffles."
House! Are you Even listening to us?,I'll start when you decide what the symptoms are and give me some theories.
"If we combine the dysosmia with the tunnel vision, the symptoms fit for western equine encephalitis.",But the Patient doesn't! no fEver.
Ow! What the hell?,Negative reinforcement.
"What about Foster Kennedy Syndrome? He could have a meningioma or plasmacytoma. Started by pressing on his olfactory nerves, it affects his sense of smell, and now it's growing and pressing on his optic nerve.","Good. MRI his head, find it."
Your potential donation!,"Hey, hey."
Apparently he was clinically dead for sEveral seconds when he O.D.'d. The dark spots could be brain damage from oxygen starvation.,Except it's not. I've seen MRI imagery like that in sParkzophrenics. Three serving two.
In your head!,"It's ""face."""
On your face!,"Close enough. The E.R. docs missed it, because he didn't present with major symptoms yet. We're seeing it in its infancy."
"So we treat him, and then what? He becomes just another sParkzophrenic homeless Man wandering the streets! We have to help him.","I'd love to, but I got four million other crazy people ahead of him on my to-do list, along with milk."
You two spent months trying to figure out a way to date and not have it affect your working relationship. Now you need to do the same thing for not dating.,"No, I don't."
This is serious. Did you know that she's!,"She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me. It's great. I mean, not the dumping part, but the part where she'll now let me do whatEver I want."
"So you're just trying to punish her? She feels bad, and your only goal is to take advantage?",That's not true. I got plenty of goals. One of them is a 60-inch flat screen right there.
"Ow! No, no, no. Not that one, this one!","Ahoy there, me hearties! Permission to come aboard."
"Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night. We assumed it was a sParkzophrenic delusion, but!","It's not. He's on Clozapine. He'd be getting better, not worse."
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll pRobably die first.,Don't make me take my shoe off!
We need to run his DNA. He could have early onset of Parkinson's.,Or cortical-based ganglionic degeneration or Huntington's or any one of a dozen other genetic diseases.
"Hey, if you let us out, we can start testing.","If we're gonna test for them all, it'll take weeks. I'm not canceling my Honeymoon to treat this kid."
"It's a fake marriage, but a real Honeymoon?",Most are.
Danny could also die before we get through testing for all the possibilities.,"So we cheat. Since it's genetic, daddy or mommy's got it too. They're either sick or dead."
"He doesn't know where his mother is, and he won't tell us where his father is.",He's a homeless ex-junkie. Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him? Green light!
He's a homeless ex-junkie. Are you telling me that you four geniuses can't outwit him? Green light!,"Cuddy got it for me. And now I'm drafting a request for a study into the effects of caffeine involving an Italian espresso maParkne and a massage chair, so make it quick."
I found Danny's father.,Well done.
"The kid said he was in a state-sponsored rehab last November. There's only one Danny Jennings that was in treatment at the time, and he listed his father's address as his primary next of kin.","The ""well done"" was for making it quick. Now I'm gonna have to take that back."
He lives about 30 minutes from the hospital.,And the reason you're continuing to talk instead of driving there?
Chase and Masters are already on their way. Why didn't you ask me to be part of your wedding?,You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?
Um! I'll! I'll come back when she's finished.,"She is. Oh, my God! W-what did you think she was doing? She's just installing the cable. That's not a euphemism!"
Who are you?,Shhh!
What are you doing?,Test.
Who are you?,"The important question is, who are you? Danny Jennings is dead, which means that Danny Jennings has no pulse. You, on the other hand! do. Ergo, you are not Danny Jennings. Or I did the test wrong. So why don't you cut the crap and tell me your real name."
No.,"Hiding your identity! Well, either you're a criminal or a superhero."
I'm not a criminal.,Awesome. What color is my underwear?
I'm not telling you my name.,No pRoblem. I just need your father's name.
Forget it.,Care to tell me why?
He's looking for me. He supposedly! cleaned up and got sober. And now he! he wants to be a part of my life again. And I can't let that happen.,You're a big boy now. You still think he can hurt you?
What's happening to me?,"Well, luckily for you, we don't need daddy to figure that one out."
Did you find out his real name?,Cerebellar ataxia.
That's a weird name.,The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup right in front of him. That plus Everything else!
The guy whiffed twice trying to pick up a cup right in front of him. That plus Everything else!,Means that we have whittled our list of genetic diseases! All the way down to one! Early-onset Parkinson's.
"After Everything he's been through, now we have to tell him, ""Hey, you have",You could lie. I'm fine with that. But you'll pRobably both feel better if you give him Levodopa and confirm with DNA tests.
I changed my mind.,"What, you want the fish instead of the Parkcken?"
"This room is for Patients' families, not for doctors trying to defraud the government.","Oh, so! you've decided to take a moral stand."
Yeah. The chapel still has sanctity for some people.,You're right. I think I saw Blue the janitor passed out in one of the pews last week.
"It's ""Lou,"" and I would have thrown him out too.","Well, where are we gonna go? We got Caterers staging Everything downstairs as we speak. We've got floral arrangements, place settings! Other wedding-y stuff."
That's not my pRoblem.,I sent out the invitations. People are coming here.
"And at the rate it's happening, he'll need a new one soon. And there's no way we'll get him on the transplant list.",What are we missing?
Except that he's gotten worse since we admitted him.,Why?
"Most of our Patients tend to do that, unless we cure them.","Yeah, but why so fast? He had dysosmia for a couple months, nEver Even came here to get it treated. He's just a random burn victim. We get him, boom, he's got tunnel vision, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and now cardiomyopathy. What's different here than, say, living in a filthy state Park?"
His condition started deteriorating before that.,Stop that Man! I need the meal card for the Patient in 243. He's eating healthy! because he can. Most of the meals in here are vegetarian. Adult Refsum disease! Fits all the symptoms. His body can't process the phytanic acid and chlorophyll. It's his healthy diet of green vegetables that's killing him.
We can save his life.,"Run him through a plasmapheresis treatment to remove the excess phytanic acid from his blood. Confirm with gene testing. Okay, I gotta go get married."
"And do you, Gregory House, take this Woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?",Yep.
I know this is not real marriage! but I really like you.,I like you too.
I like you too.,I can't.
Why not?,I nEver sleep with married women. I'm going to bed. You can take the couch.
What the hell happened to you? Why'd you lie about going to Rome?,"You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in! drug rehab."
I didn't Even know you had a pRoblem.,"Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and Robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our Patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate."
She's that Canadian kid who's trying to be the youngest person to sail around the world.,"Collapsed yesterday during a practice run. Luckily for us, cameras were there. Corporate sponsors want us to check that's she seaworthy before the clock strikes ""you're too old to set a record."" Gives us three days. You've still only got one, right?"
"Uh, last day as a student. Could be simple dehydration. She told the Coast Guard she had felt dizzy.",Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?
"But what about her back? Look. Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.","Nice. Blood draws Every 15 minutes for four hours. Let's track her cortisol. Masters, there's no hurry. There's no wrong choices. At least, that's what they tell people who make crappy choices."
What's with the sudden interest in her future?,"You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O! gets curious about who ends up wielding it."
"Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP I need to get. So I'd like to go to the E.R.","Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me."
"Rehab? Great cover story. Now I can't Ever drink around those guys again, thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.",Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.
There's a Parkcken in your office.,"No, there isn't."
"Oh, great.","Relax. She's completely honest, but also completely boring. Watch this. Don't tell anyone."
Of course not. You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?"
"Um, I! after careful consideration, I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.",Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.
"Uh, you forged the last one. I only did nine LPs.",Do you know how to do an LP?
Of course.,"Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten? It's time to grow up. Turn that in, the job's yours. Stop staring blankly and go. No doubt something horrible has just happened to our Patient."
You knew he had a Parkcken? How comeï¿½?,Down here! Loss of consciousness plus she's slowly turning blue. Can we rule out magical gum?
"Uh, why are you putting, um, Parkcken footprints on the floor?",That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.
Ah.,Hello? The quietest and calmest of all the Parkckens.
But not the loss of consciousness. Cerebral vasospasm explains both.,Cerebral vasospasm makes sense. Take Thirteen. Give the Patient a calcium channel blocker infusion in the basilar artery. Masters. I thought you were going to turn that in.
"Um, I, um, been busy with my Patient.",You're not busy now. Bawwwwwwk bawk.
I handed in my log.,"On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away."
Yes. And I still broke a rule.,My rule. Told you to defy the Man. Not this Man.
Can we go?,No. Not liking it is fine. Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old. Wastes your potential.
You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.,That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.
You think I'm exceptional?,Not anymore.
I can do my job without compromising.,"No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine."
Hypotension. Low cardiac output. Float the swan.,Don't you have your own surgery?
I took a break. I told them I had to pee.,You lied. Small one. But it's a gateway lie.
I care about the Patient.,Another lie. You care about being exceptional.
I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.,A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.
Add that to a calcified pineal gland.,"When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's nEver, butï¿½"
Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.,"You had me at ""I had to pee."" But Thirteen's right. Start her on three fold immunosuppressants. Masters, if you want to fight me on this, fill out a consult form so you can stick around. Welcome back."
I'm not back! I'll just be staying for this case.,You got really good at this lying thing.
Oh!,You want yours extra crispy or original recipe?
I'm stuck.,"No, you're not. Case is over. You're back to surgery. And fetch. Oh, that's a good boy. Oh, that's a good boy. Hey, good boy."
No one will stop Kendall's sail. You need to step in.,Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician. Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.
She could die.,"Pretty sure the law of the land states that Everyone has the right to be an idiot. Uh! I think it's the second amendment. Fetch! Bring it here, boy. Who's a good boy?"
"You are constantly railing against hypocrisy, forcing people to face the truth. This time nothing?",Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.
And made a decision that will in all likelihood kill their daughter.,I'm fine with that. I wanted a diagnosis. I got it. What do you want?
I don't want her to die.,Break the rules.
I can't.,"So coloring inside the lines is more important to you than saving this girl's life? I was wrong about one thing, you are not exceptional. And fetch! Ho ho ho. Oh, that's a good boy. Good boy. Good boy."
Depends on who you ask.,Fetch!
"Dr. Masters, thank you.",Someone has got their pouty face on.
I did things no doctor in their right mind would do.,Good.
"I Manipulated, lied, forged, stole.",I don't want to know the specifics. Might be called to testify.
I broke the rules because I beliEved I was right.,You were right.
"Then why don't I feel good or satisfied? Instead, I just feel like throwing up.",And you're following me to ask how I break the rules and maintain my rosy demeanor.
I didn't do it to be happy. I just thought I would be.,"Well, you can't always get what you want. To the victor of the spoils. Your bird recover okay?"
House. I can't do it. I'm leaving.,Surgery?
I! don't know what I'm going to do. But I do know I don't want to be here.,Nothing will Ever be simple again.
"I think if you spend your days designing Ever more effective ways to blow people up, stuff's bound to come back to you.",Thirsty. Side effect of a new antihistamine I'm on.
You don't seem congested.,"Hmm, intriguing."
You have any thoughts about our Patient?,"Got some questions about whether Thirteen really beliEves in karma or just wants to. As for the Patient, it's not gonna be easy to break into her office. Might want to start with her home."
We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.,Sure. Go ahead.
"If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?",I am definitely interested. Could be a tumor. Could be a CNS bleed. What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?
Let's go. Let's go.,Bet's off. Fight was fixed. That punch barely touched him.
You bet on Foley to beat Zachary?,Speed beats power! unless speed has been paid to speedily take a dive.
"He touched him enough to put him on the canvas and the official counted him out, which means you officially owe me! 50 bucks.",We bet on a sporting Event. That was not sporting. Less than 30 seconds. That was barely Even Event-y.
"Okay, here's what I saw. You lost and I won.","Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks."
Prove it. Prove it or pay up. You got one day. And don't make me send my boys out looking for you. What? All right.,"So, two puzzles. Tie goes to the one that costs me money. Keep each other posted."
Nope. Try to stay as still as possible. This shouldn't take long.,"Hey, how's it going?"
"You mind? I mean, there are plenty of other seats.",I'm not here to Judge. You did what was best for you and I got no pRoblem with that.
I'm not gonna ask you nice again. Just go away.,"Or what? You're suddenly gonna fall down? Listen. I got a pRoblem. A guy who knows absolutely nothing about boxing, because of you now thinks he does. You can imagine the potential ramifications. I need you to get on the phone with him and tell him you took a dive."
I didn't take a dive.,Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you and we're done. Just enough to convince him. Not enough to get you in any trouble.
I didn't take a dive.,"Yeah. That story's getting boring. Look, I'm not from the commission. I'm not some bookie. I'm a doctor. This is my I.D."
"Look, if you were a bookie, you'd know no one pays a guy to throw a fight he has no chance to win. I was a 12-to-1 underdog. Lost my last five fights.",But you were the better fighter. That last punch barely touched you.
"You Ever been barely touched by a guy who weighs 230 pounds? Look at me. Look where I am, what I'm wearing. Now, do I look like a guy who just got a payday? I didn't throw the fight. I just suck.",Ha! Proof.
Just because he wasn't hit in the faceï¿½,"Look at his pupils. He has anisocoria, which, given his age, the adrenaline surge of the fight, the fact that he's still alive means he was tachycardic. He has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome."
"The bet was on who would win, not who would live the longest.","If he's physically unable to continue because of a preexisting illness, then it's technically a ""no contest,"" which means all bets are off."
You know that just because I was right about this one fighter doesn't make you any less of a Man?,"Actually, it would, if you were right."
"Oh, excuse me, Dr. House.","Dï¿½solï¿½, je ne parle pas anglais."
I'm a co-worker of Wendy Lee's. I'm also her boyfriend.,Great. I'm a guy who doesn't care.
She's your Patient.,"Oh, you thought I didn't know who Wendy Lee was? Yeah, makes sense. I'm not good at names. Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?"
Her last boyfriend was a real nut. He's basically stalking her.,"See, this is what I don't care about. I don't care who cares about her. Used to care about her. Either one you falls down dead, you can drop me a note."
I think I know what's wrong with her.,You screwed up in the lab and accidentally spilled some bomb on her?
Poisoned?,Apparently our mad scientist is also a slutty scientist whose milkshakes got all the nerds in the yard fighting over her.
She's a slut because she's dated two different guys at work?,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were still judging her."
"Couldn't hurt to start activated charcoal, see what happens.",You know what else wouldn't hurt? This case is getting interesting. Let's add a little danger.
We start her on Valium for alcohol withdrawal. It's the best we've got right now.,One normal EKG does not a healthy person make.
"Look, I told you I just suck.","Oh, you make me so sad. Don't talk like that."
Why do you care so much?,Kill me for loving my Patients. It's just what I do.
Kill me for loving my Patients. It's just what I do.,"Hey, stop. Stop! Look, my""ï¿½my leg hurts. Okay? Just talk to me for a moment. You don't have to be a loser."
Thanks.,"WhatEver's wrong with you, it's real. Sick is good. Sick means it can get better. You cold get better. And I don't mean healthier. I mean! maybe you don't have to suck."
"Could be gas in the perinephric space, in which case, we should be prepping her for emergency surgery.",What looks like Wolff-Parkinson-White but isn't?
Her EKG was normal.,"So was his. That's why I said ""looks like."" As in similar to, but not the same."
You want us to help you get out of paying your bet while your actual Patient lies in agony.,"Who's the real bad guy here? The guy who doesn't care enough to help or the four guys who are not competent enough to help? He works out too much, gets pounded too much, and not in the roMantic way. His pupilsï¿½"
I got it.,Your Patient? No. Plenty of time to save her life after we save my money.
"You ignore us all the time. You go on crazy joyrides all the time. But you answer pages, you sleep. I know I'm gonna regret doing this, but I'll ask anyway. Is there anything I can do to help?",Although!
Although!,"Great news! You have an underlying neurological condition, which together with your heartï¿½"
You said my heart was fine.,"Yeah, I also said I would get you your career back. But it doesn't seem to matter since you've so clearly been handed the golden spit bucket. Sympathetic overdrive. It's a medical term. So is ""great news."" Of course, if you prefer wallowing! All you need is a Parkn. And a heart, apparently. Then you can go back to being the guy who won 20 of his first 20 instead of the guy who lost 5 of his last 5. Although, technically, I count the last one as a ""no contest."""
And you save 50 bucks.,I'm a doctor. I don't tell a fat guy to lay off bacon for less than 300. This is about dignity for both of us. Give me your arm. Give me your arm.
What the hell?,Don't worry. It's just epinephrine.
Ep-is it dangerous?,"In the wrong hands, very. So! yeah, sort of. This will only take a few seconds. And! you are tachycardic."
"Yo, are you psycho?","We combine the increased heart rate with chest trauma by applying a little sweet science to the science. Don't worry. I'll""ï¿½I'll explain more when you wake up. Now, the punch that supposedly knocked you out looked like it was thrown by an old cripple. Kind of like this."
"Look, stop it.","Three, two, one. Huh. Seem to be older and more crippled than I thought."
Look ï¿½ no. You're embarrassing me.,Doesn't make sense. Maybe if Iï¿½
You're an idiot.,How did you get in here?
My boss has me break into places all the time.,"Pain has been getting worse. I figured if I upped the Vicodin any more, I'd end up back in a rubber room, so this seemed like the smarter choice."
You're an idiot.,You drove all the way over here to break in and call me an idiot?
"No, I drove all the way over here to tell you we're implanting an automated cardio-defibrillator, which won't actually do anything to help the Patient except maybe give us enough time to come up with a guess as to what's actually wrong with her.","Oh, that makes more sense."
And I broke in here because Cuddy and Wilson both separately asked me to.,Even more logical.
"And that's not heroin, which means you knew I was coming over here, and Cuddy and Wilson are right. You're just playing a game. Throwing out a bone and watParkng us fight over it. {She starts to leave in a huff.]",There is another theory. Compound CS-804. It's an experimental drug that's supposed to regrow muscle.
This experiment was done on rats.,It's groundbreaking. Huge success.
In rats.,"Well, they got four legs. Think how fast it should work on one."
The rats are doing great.,"""Great"" is a little vague."
"Even better than the previous study. 12% increase in strength, 22% in flexibility, and some improvement in at least 60% of the subjects.",Have you done maximum tolerated dose studies?
"Not yet. But that's part of the beauty. Since the compound is easily excreted in urine, as long as they keep hydrated, there's really no reason to expect any danger at virtually any dose. I mean, obviously you can't know for sure.","But if it's worthy of the preface ""obviously,"" then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots. Do I look like an idiot? Sorry. Cranky. What I meant to say was: Why don't scientists have groupies? 'Cause I'd do you right now if society wasn't telling me that you're just an underpaid dork."
You all right?,Leg hurts. Would you mind getting me a coffee?
How does coffee help your leg?,It will prEvent me from walking to get the coffee.
Experimental drugs?,"That's unfair. 'Cause at one point, Even Vicodin was an experimental drug. I have to go."
"Well, unless you're going to do your job, it can wait.",I'm going to do my job.
I'll give you a lift.,"I'll give you two minutes. But first, I'm gonna tell you that I'm off the drugs and you'll feel silly 'cause you've got nothing to say for two minutes."
Hmm. Why are you off them?,Because they don't work.
Why were you on them?,Because they come in banana flavor. You know the answer.
You think fixing your leg will fix your life.,"I think that my life will be somewhat better if part of my life, specifically my leg, is somewhat better."
You think all your pRoblems are your leg.,"And you're here to tell me that no matter how depressed I may be, it's not enough."
"I think you want Everything to be physical, tangible, simple. You want unhappiness to have a cure. House, you obviouslyï¿½","I hate that word. I have to go now. Actually, I don't, but it would be rude to walk out without saying anything."
Excuse me. We have to go.,You need a drink.
I'm fine.,That wasn't a question. You really do need a drink.
"I drink any more, I'm gonna explode.","You're not going to explode. You're just gonna have a seizure, which will prove that your kidneys are not working, which will also prove that they weren't working Saturday night. That's why a glancing body blow sent your blood pressure into the toilet and you onto the canvas."
How Many bottles is this supposed to take?,Six.
And I've drank how Many?,Eight. It's not an exact science.
"So in other words, nothing's gonna prove you wrong. You're just gonna keep making me miserable because you're too miserableï¿½","You're an idiot. No, you're not gonna hit me! 'Cause somewhere deep in that way-too-thin skull of yours you know that you're full of crap. That's why you stopped jogging for me. That's why you drank eight bottles. Because Even though you want to think that I'm wrong 'cause it's simpler, you also desperately want me to be right. I'm only an ass for building your hopes up if I'm wrong. Last one."
You were wrong. It's not the end of the world.,Anything else you want to say?
You have a pRoblem. I think if you seriously look at Everything thatï¿½,Anything else?
"Okay, look, this isn'tï¿½ Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! No! I don't. Just get out of here. Go home. We'll talk later. Someplace without any of my stuff.",Nothing to talk about. That was my point.
You're drunk.,"Well, whose fault is that? Give me another scotch."
I can't serve you.,"This 'cause I'm black? 'Cause I'm not, so!"
"Come on, buddy.","Look, you can't get me drunk and then give me crap for being drunk. That's like dumping someone and then giving them crap for being upset. That's just not decent. Let me explain why people come here. They come here to drink. Which causes us to ask, why do people drink? Hmm? Is it sustenance? No. Is it taste? No."
Don't be a jerk.,"Is it the company of stout-hearted men? I don't think so. Is it killing pain? Yes. SEven and a half percent life duller. That's the business you're in. You're in the ""screw the world"" business. You're in the ""reality sucks and fantasy temporarily appears to not suck"" business."
Just get the moron a drink so he'll shut the hell up.,No.
I'm giving you your drink.,Have you no pride? Either serving me is a good idea or it's a bad idea. Shutting me up is a crappy reason for compromising what you beliEve.
Not Even an effective one apparently.,Am I gonna have to hit him?
Not a good idea.,But what if it's the right thing to do? Compromise is nEver the answer. Stand up. I will allow you to throw the first punch.
Sit down. I'm not gonna hit you.,"Just as well, 'cause I was lying."
What are you doing here?,Training for my big fight. Just need you toï¿½
"Drink five more bottles? Get punched a few more times? Look, just get out and give up.",That's your specialty.
"Ooh, looks like you already lost your big fight. Look, I may not be able to take a punch, but I can still throw one.","Three, two! What a lovely day."
He had a security clearance.,"Ahem! What's this? A palm. Hmm, useful for Many things. Slapping, greasing, pRobably some other applications too. Right now it's ready for $50 and humiliation."
He was actually sick?,"He wasn't knocked out by the punch. He was knocked out by the clinch before the punch. Took a shot to the back of the neck. More specifically, to an abnormal growth of nerves caused by a glomus tumor. Kind of like a built-in taser. Sent a massive shock to his entire body, shut Everything down."
Wow. Fascinating. Completely explains exactly how he lost.,"Oh, you are not gonna be like that, 'cause you got a lot more posters here."
"No, I'm not. Well done, House. You might have saved that guy. Given him his life back.","Oh, no. He needs surgery. He's nEver gonna fight again."
What happened to your eye? You okay?,Better than okay.
I promise.,Look at how much fun she's having.
"That's because he has two functioning legs, capable of supporting her body weight.",So do I.
You told me most of your muscle was cut out.,I was going for the sympathy discount. Been taking some experimental medicine.
"Yeah, I got a lot of clients on experimental medicine.",You want proof?
You want proof?,"Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do."
"Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do.","See? Now, Even if those implants were made of adaMantium, I'd still be able to!"
"See? Now, Even if those implants were made of adaMantium, I'd still be able to!",Sorry. Cramp.
I'm sure.,I'm not gonna be needing your services tonight after all.
Dr. House.,Dr. Riggin. Figures you'd be wrapping up the trial by now. I just wanted to give you a hearty mazel tov.
And don't forget the Nobel Prize for dEveloping an incredibly expensive rat poison.,What do you mean? What happened?
Just look at these things.,Any indication the rats were getting sick?
I came here because you're a doctor! not a shrink.,Ugh!
Ugh!,Ah! Ugh! Ugh!
"Sweetie! go wait for mommy by the couch, okay? Go on.",I tried calling Everyone else. You were the last one on the list.
Any reason why 911 wasn't on the list?,It's not an emergency.
Right. Are you suicidal?,I'm not attempting bypass surgery. The tumors are small and they're close to the surface. I thought it'd be like! removing a wart.
You couldn't wait till morning; bring your CT scans to an actual surgeon?,Surgeons are idiots. They'd just hack away at the muscle until they get worn out.
Or you're just ashamed you've been injecting a drug that hasn't Even gone through safety trials. It's nEver Even been in the huMan body.,I got one of the tumors. The second one is close. You can use the CT to help you find the third.
I'm taking you to the hospital.,"Just""ï¿½just excise the tumor."
What happened to your leg?,I was trying to make it better.
"He was being reckless. Sit back, Honey. This isn't about making your leg better. It's about making your life better.",Here we go. Wish I had called 911.
Why else would you risk your life doing something so stupid?,"Well, you know, I've had a lot of setbacks lately."
Darrien? Darrien! She lost consciousness.,There are no cars coming. Just go.
Stop with the pirate talk.,"If you don't want Brownbeard to end up with two wooden legs, better get yer ma to move this ship, you Mangy bilge rat."
Of course! You showed her that filthy cartoon. What kind of idiot lets a three-year-old watch that?,"If you want to lecture me on my poor judgment, there would seem to be more relevant examples."
Your heart rate's over 120. You're clammy. I think you're going into shock. Are you lightheaded?,I'm fine.
I'm fine.,Did you see the new Brownbeard episode?
It was so funny.,"No, it was so lame. Got a boat full of guy pirates and they make the girl pirate walk the plank."
She floated.,That's 'cause she had big boobies. That's why he should have kept her.
"We've got to get you into surgery. Where is that nurse? Rachel, let's go find the nurse.",2:00 a.m. Nice of you to call me back.
Chase and I are in the hospital with a Patient.,You've completely run out of ideas and you're calling me to bail you out. I'm touched. Hit me.
No.,She on any medication! besides crack?
"She was taking Interferon in prison, so I'm guessing she's had Hep-C for at least ten years.",Can I guess stuff too? 'Cause that's gonna make the diagnosis really easy.
And we can't exactly ask the Patient.,"Yeah, that would have been pre-coma. But how could you have known that it would affect her that way?"
We didn't think we had anything mysterious untilï¿½,How about renal cancer throwing clots?
Urinalysis was negative.,That's too bad. 'Cause that was my one big idea.
"House? House, you there?",Tell me more about the Patient. What was she doing before prison?
"She was a cop. Shot a kid in self defense, nEver got over the guilt, started taking drugs, and got busted.",Way to bury the lead. How long ago was the shooting?
I'm not sure. Why?,"Again, you assumed she's had Hep-C for ten years. Find out when she shot the kid, you'll find out when she started taking drugs, and when she actually contracted the Hep-C."
And you think this is relevant?,"It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat."
"It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat.",Three Parkcks just came into my bedroom. I got to go.
They're ready for you.,Wait. I want you in there.
I'm not a surgeon. There's nothing I can do.,"Well, you can make sure that! idiot butcher doesn't cut more than he needs to."
You already signed a release. He's gonna do what he needs to do.,"Yeah, and if that involves chopping off my leg! I want to be sure that that's damn well necessary."
House!,I don't trust him. I trust you.
You're lucky.,What are you doing here?
You hoping for someone else?,"Hot nurse, candy striper! Someone who doesn't speak English. Someone who doesn't speak judgmental."
"""I hope your leg feels better and I hope we can be friends again soon, you bloody scallywag.""",I have to pee.
That's a good sign.,I'm a big boy.
You're an ass.,"What, for trying to walk on a freshly Mangled leg? Performing surgery on myself? For thinking I could solve my emotional pRoblems with rat medicine? If you're gonna nag, at least have the decency to be specific."
Come on. Listen to me. You can't keep going like this. Something has to change.,Can I pee first?
Can I pee first?,I know.
That's what they're there for.,Hey. We were just getting to the good part.
"That's Afsoun Hamidi. She's a genius. She just won the MacArthur, legally proving it. Just had a retrospective at the Tate Modern. Nobody reads The New Yorker?",Nope. But I subscribe to her Patient file.
"House, you should relax. You had surgery this morning.","Minor surgery, removing a drain."
Put there during major surgery.,My doctor says it's okay as long as I don't leave my hospital bed.
Which doctor was that ï¿½ Seuss or J?,Nurse.
I'm surprised he approved it. I'm more surprised you actually asked.,I do things like that now. I'm making some changes! like skipping ahead to minute 37.
I'm not gonna watch a Woman get set on fire.,Philistine.
Who's the guy with the notebook who can't decide what to do?,"Her assistant. He's been instructed not to intervene. Spoiler alert ï¿½ he does. For her, it is literally heartbreaking. Let the games begin."
One Man's crazy is another Woman's art. Her work explores things like gender politics and self-image.,And the pressing issue of shaving your entire body in public while wearing a monkey mask.
I still vote for nuts. We should run a resting-state functional MRI to look for increased activity in the dorsal nexus.,She's not nuts.
The monkey-mask-shaving medium really speaks to you?,"What speaks to me is she's elevated being full of crap to a genuine art form and made a fortune doing it. People that pay 20 grand for one of her video stills, on the other hand, really do need their dorsal nexi checked."
There was a space heater next to her in the gallery.,Carbon monoxide poisoning. It fits. Put her in a hyperbaric chAmber.
"Oh, thank God. The I.C.U. isn't being attacked by giant radioactive spiders.",Did I text you that? That was meant for my dream journal. I wanted to return your stuff. Don't worry. I didn't go AWOL. I had my wife-maid bring it over.
"My sweater, a coffee mug, a half-used bottle of lotion, and a DVD of ""Marley & Me.""ï¿½","Given your thing for Owen Wilson, I thought you might want those last two back asap."
I don't get it.,You masturbate to Owen Wilson.
I meant the box.,"Oh. It's a symbolic gesture. I want things to go back to the way they were before we started dating ï¿½ no more bad feelings, no more issues, just work. Thanks for coming."
I haven't Even spoken to you since you hurt yourself.,I was self-destructive. It won't happen again. I'm making changes. I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.
Great. The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it. If you don't understandï¿½,I think I could avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.
"Well, I don't want to find out you're wrong by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.","I'm a big beliEver that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit, and pour lye on it."
I'm just asking you to talk about it. You owe me. Forget about saving your life. You exposed my daughter to that obnoxious pirate cartoon.,"Bring me lunch tomorrow, and we can plumb my depths."
"You think that's a symptom? He's in love with her. He was pRobably overwhelmed, couldn't decide what to do.",What's he been doing since she was admitted? Did he bring anything from the Patient room to the treatment room?
"A few things ï¿½ a handbag, flowers, stuffed elephant.",Does she seem like the kind of Woman who needs a stuffed animal?
"Who are you calling? Oh, of course.","What are you wearing? Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room."
"What are you wearing? Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room.",Now go address the elephant in the room.
This is a Nanny Cam.,The reason Luca couldn't decide what to do in the treatment room is the same as in the gallery. He's been told not to intervene. Congratulations. We've become her latest work of art.
Why are we Even discussing this case? She lied to us. It's opening us up to malpractice.,Our practice opens us up to malpractice.
How do we know she's actually sick?,Her being sick is a clue.
She would have let him set her on fire because of the honesty of her work. Faking an illness doesn't fit.,"Thirteen's right ï¿½ at least her conclusion was. Everything else was laughably wrong. If the Patient induced pancreatitis and a heart attack, she'd be suicidal."
Exactly. She's risking her life all the time.,"Exactly. If she wanted to be dead, she'd be dead a long time ago. Pretending to cheat death pays better than watercolors. Coxsackie B fits. But do a spiral C.T. of her biliary tree to rule out gallstones."
Fine. I'll get the C.T.,Sure. I'd be happy to come with you. Thanks for asking.
You're supposed to stay in bed ï¿½ doctor's orders.,"If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong. You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs, not her biliary tree. You want to find fibrosis and prove your ""paint thinner"" theory. If I don't come with, when you fail, you'll pretend you nEver tried. I don't really have a choice, now, do I?"
"If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong. You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs, not her biliary tree. You want to find fibrosis and prove your ""paint thinner"" theory. If I don't come with, when you fail, you'll pretend you nEver tried. I don't really have a choice, now, do I?","Since I've seen your paycheck, I pRobably shouldn't. Canned beans aren't so bad! as long as they're cooked over an oil-drum fire under a bridge with the king of the hobos."
"Pale, diaphoretic, tachycardic, B.P., 80 over 40. Internal bleeding?",Get her out of here and scope her.
You stood me up.,Sorry. Should have scheduled my Patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.
"You're still playing the same petty, passive-aggressive games.","Got you to go all the way to the second floor of a building you work in. Boy, did I screw with you."
You said you were going to change.,Check the sign. It says you got to treat me with intensive care.
"I'm expressing my anger. You should try it. Right now, let's finally have our fight.",All we do is fight.
"No, all you've done is pull pranks or have temper tantrums with Wilson, nEver me, marry mail-order prostitutes, make me go to your weddingï¿½",Dominika is a licensed aesthetician.
You cut open your own leg.,So all this was about you?
"You don't think it was Even related? House, we've nEver Even had a conversation about our breakup. You are obviously still angry at me. And it's hurting both of us.","Wow, I hadn't realized the incredible healing power of lunch."
It wasn't working.,"Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow in the cafeteria. You happy?"
How Many of those have you had today?,"I don't know. Is ""your mother"" a number?"
The Patient is a fraud. I found a puncture in the dorsal vein of her left foot.,Shooting up heroin wouldn't explainï¿½
"Not heroin. She was injecting herself with her own red blood cells. It caused her heart issues, and when her hematocrit Evened out, we mistook it for internal bleeding.",It must have been a very distinctively shaped and awfully talkative puncture for you to get all of that.
Browser history on her laptop helped. She was researParkng blood doping among other things.,She was researParkng me?
"Knowing him, he'll be in a bar. He'll find one that matches how he feels inside. It'll be the most dark, depressing hole you can find in New Jersey.",Now you're just pissing me off.
I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know she researched you. I had no idea sheï¿½,"If you don't know anything, then why are you talking?"
Please don't take it out on Luca.,I'll take it out on whoEver I think will irritate you the most.
I thought you would understand someone who uses their work to deal with pain.,I didn't realize that search engines could look within the soul.
You're standing in front of me in a hospital gown.,What the hell was the point of this? What personal trauma are you exploiting. I'm! sorry ï¿½ mining for its artistic potential?
Wait. You're really sick?,Why me?
"If I do, there won't be any game for him, and then there won't be any art for us.",Why me?
I don't answer those questions.,"You know, there's a lot of games I could play that don't involve dealing with narcissistic, Manipulative poseurs."
"But this is a puzzle tailor-made for you. You don't know which of my symptoms are real, which are fake, which ones I'm not Even telling you about. I know that intrigues you. Do you really want to end it now?",No.
You want us to waste a bed on her?,You took an oath! an oath to be cool. At least that was the one I mumbled under my breath while Everyone else was doing the boring one.
"Even if she is sick, which I don't beliEve, she also says she has a diagnosis. So it's either just a lie, or it's just a game.",So what? I like the game. It's fun. Go get a blood culture. Check for parasites and bacteria.
"This is the new House ï¿½ half the leg power, twice the irresponsibility?",The new House is about making my life healthier. NEver said anything about yours. Go get her blood.
"I'll do it. He's going through a tough patch right now. If this is the distraction he needs to keep him in his hospital bed, I'm sure it's better than any of the alternatives.",That was incredibly condescending. Did it work?
"That pancreatic cyst we drained ï¿½ it's back, and she doesn't care at all.",You think she actually is suicidal.
"I would, but how did she give herself the cysts? Tox screen was negative, and there's no sign of trauma.",There is another explanation. The reason she didn't react isn't 'cause she wants to die. It's 'cause she knows she can't do anything about it. WhatEver she has is fatal. That should narrow it down.
What are we doing here?,"Testing a theory. It's based on some stuff you can't understand, like RR variability, and some stuff you can, like the fact that she shaved her head in an art piece four months ago."
That was a commentary on society'sï¿½,"It was a commentary on the fact that it was gonna fall out anyway, and she wanted to hide why."
"Cancer? Are""ï¿½are you sure about that?","See that tumor-ish thingamajig near her ""brainamabob""?"
"Oh, God.",Are you getting this? Game's over. I won. Primary CNS lymphoma with associated paraneoplastic syndrome.
"Luca, my mind was not clear then.","And then you cleared it. Then you realized you could use your death to make your magnum opus. Maybe you wanted to show that no one can cheat death, Even an entire team of doctors with unlimited resources. Or maybe your first doctors didn't treat you like a person ï¿½ just a series of symptoms. You wanted to re-create that depersonalization. And I was the Man to see."
"If that was what I thought, I don't any longer. You spent time with me. You took this personally.","No, I didn't. And I don't actually think your piece is about anything. I think you just figured out that you're mortal. You're just a bag of cells and waste with an expiration date. You wanted to act out. You wanted people to notice. Maybe you Even prayed for a different answer this time. I got a title for your piece ï¿½ ""It Doesn't Mean Anything."""
You're forging my name on prescriptions again.,No. What you just said implies that I stopped at some point.
"20 minutes ago, I put a notice out to all local pharmacies to require verbal authorization before filling my prescriptions.",You have any idea how much extra work you've just given yourself? You're not gonna last a week.
"I've been dealing with this for years. But it's over ï¿½ your liver, your hearing, nEver mind the fact that each scrip you write is a separate felony. You will serve time, so could I.",You've chosen this moment to give me crap about my Vicodin use?
You filled this three days ago. Now it's almost half gone.,So is my leg.
It's a month supply. The amount you're taking has nothing to do with physical pain.,"Okay. So maybe I am trying to numb myself a little, because I'm trying to change, trying to stop being self-destructive."
So you can only handle not self-destructing by being self-destructive?,What do you want from me?
"I don't know, House, but I'm worried about you. I don't know how Many times I can watch you cut off pieces of yourself. Now it's the I.C.U. Next time it'll be the morgue. You're miserable. And you're angry. And I want you to actually deal with that and not just try to mediCate the issue away.",No. You know what I feel right now? I don't feel miserable or angry. I don't feel good or bad. I feel! nothing! which feels great.
What are you doing?,"Moving on. In the direction of my House, where I got some more pills."
"If you're discharging yourself against doctor's orders, you've got to check that box.","I'm a doctor. So, technicallyï¿½"
Wouldn't it be easier if you just checked the box?,Why are you still here?
Does this mean something?,It's not eczema. And it's not cancer.
Radiation? On my brain? But it made me fuzzy last time. It was harder to work. I am still slowed down from it.,"And it'll get worse. But, you know, dying can also do a number on your ability to think."
"I can't watch you die! not when you can save yourself. Good-bye, Afsoun.",Good for you.
Good for you.,So.
"So. Why did I Ever ban alcohol from the cafeteria? Before I forget, there's a brush. Tortoise-shell handle, natural bristles ï¿½ wasn't in the box. If you could look for it!",Like the Lindbergh baby. You dating anyone?
We don't have toï¿½,"Look, it's just standard lunch conversation."
Not for us.,"Okay, well, if you've gone over to the ""we don't talk about things"" side, then I've got a pot roast in the oven."
No. I haven't dated anyone since you.,"Well, you know what they say ï¿½ once you go gimp!"
We s-should talk about your leg.,"You think I have unresolved issues, and you are the unresolved issues."
"Yes. But it's""ï¿½it's ï¿½ I think it's more than that. It's your life, your choices.","I did it to fix my life. No, wait. No, I did it because I'm a deeply unhappy person. No""ï¿½no, I did it to get sympathy from you. I did it to piss you off. I did it because I'm not over you. Or I was over you, and I was moving on. I did it because I wanted to know what it's like not to be in pain. I did it because I want to feel more pain. WhatEver the reason, it was a bad reason and a bad idea. That's all that matters. Good lunch."
House! talk to me!,I already did.
"No, you just parroted back what Wilson and I've been saying to you the last few days.",Get out of my way.
"No. Oh, you pulled a stitch. House, please just talk to me.",You want to know how I feel? I feel hurt.
I know. I'm sorry.,It's not your fault.
I! didn't expect that.,Sorry. Just checking the stitches on my penis.
Your leg okay?,It's healing.
Good. Just came to grab the radiation-therapy forms.,What?
Afsoun changed her mind.,Get out. You made a decision.
I changed my mind.,Why?
Because there are more important things thanï¿½,"Than what ï¿½ than your brain, your abilities? It's where Everything comes from ï¿½ any meaning in your life, any happiness."
Not all happinessï¿½,"He's already left once. He's gonna leave you again. You don't need to depend on people who are gonna let you down. If you do this, you're a pathetic hypocrite. You're saying that your whole life, all your work up until him was a pointlessï¿½"
You alright? You go to lunch with Cuddy?,Yeah.
How was it?,The pasta Arrabbiata was cold.
Why don't we get a drink? We could go to the Sawmill.,Cuddy's is on the way. I need to return this.
You think she's going to have an emergency tangle?,It was on my mind. I want to get it off.
Want me to come?,If I get in trouble? I'm delivering a hair brush.
What just happened?,Get out.
What just happened?,Get out.
Aah!,You're right. I feel much better.
You want another one?,"No, I think I've had enough. What do you think I should do today?"
I don't know. Go home?,Not tonight. Cheers.
You ran here?,It's just... 8 miles.
Why did you...?,"Why does a dog lick its ""ï¿½ workplace acceptable euphemism for testicles?"
Because he can.,What have you got for me boss?
I thought you said you needed 8 weeks of rehab. You should have been back hereï¿½,"If I'd come back sooner, I'd only be able to run 6 miles. I nEver would have made it in. What have you got for me?"
You're completely pain free? The ketamine treatment can wear off.,It's been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me?
It can take as long as--,"Why are we having this discussion? Want to hear me thank you again? Thank you Dr Cuddy. Not just for removing the bullet, but thank you for putting me in a ketamine-induced coma and changing my life. Happy? I am."
Middle-aged Man: had hair transplant about 2 months ago--,"Infection throwing clots, you're an idiot. Except you're not an idiot, and she's holding a file for a 26-yr-old female, what have you really got for me?"
"Girl was doing an inverted yoga pose, neck snapped, paralyzed from the neck down except the x-rays show no evidence of spinal injury. And she's cute.","Oh, well played sir! What about Stephen Hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?"
"Forget it - brain cancer, brain surgery - there's nothing left to diagnose. I would take the other one.",Hmm... I'll take them both.
You don't think he had brain cancer?,Of course he had brain cancer; Even oncologists don't screw up for 8 years.
So if there's no diagnostic issue why are you taking the case?,Treatment can be interesting.
Not to you.,I've changed.
"No, you haven't.","No, I haven't."
Then why are you taking the case?,Guy tried to kill himself.
"The guy had cancer, he's a lump; he hasn't been able to touch his wife, speak to his kids.","He's been in that chair for 8 years, his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain. Isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?"
Not for you.,I've changed.
No you haven't.,Then why am I taking this case?
Then why am I taking this case?,Let's start with the cute paraplegic.
Healthy.,"Quad with no broken neck, struck me as odd."
Uhh... you could take a whole 2 minutes to ease into being back.,"Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck. So, go."
We heard they nEver found the guy. There's no new leads?,What? You think he might have shot this Patient too? Would explain her symptoms!
Could be MS.,See? It's not so difficult.
See? It's not so difficult.,"It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it."
The leg looks fine. You totally pain free?,When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?
I asked Cuddy to replace the carpet.,"No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?"
I--,"Re-do the tests. Let's see if the source of the pRoblem is in the limbs or the spine. Do an EMG. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Got a whole other quad to cover; this guy's still got fluid in his lungs."
You don't think that's from the pool he drank?,"Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable."
Comfortable?,Scoot.
Thanks for being here.,Not a pRoblem.
My dad wouldn't kill himself.,You haven't spoken to him in over 6 years.
He wouldn't kill himself.,Fine. I'm wrong. You obviously have a better understanding of this Man who drools in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.
"Look, he must have been confused. It must have been an accident.","Hope it was a suicide attempt. If he was trying to kill himself then he knows how miserable his life is, means there's still something there to kill; means your dad's still there."
We were doing the EMG but we nEver got past the insertion of the conduction pin. Did she just say thank you?,I loaned her some money. What went wrong?
Nothing went wrong.,Nothing went wrong then something went right.
You're not going to tell me why she thanked you?,You're not going to tell me what went right?
You did something for which she is grateful and you're... embarrassed?,"For you. Saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-yr-old boy, I set her straight."
"I'm not telling you what went wrong - or right, until you tell me why she said thank you.","Ohhh, you got me. You know I need to know, I'm so going to fold. Except you're forgetting, there's one thing I can do now."
It's either that or a reflex response.,What happened?
"Ok, this is Dr. House. House, this is Caren--","Pleasure's all mine, what happened?"
"When we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.",She flinched! Did you hear?
Does that mean I'm getting better?,How big is a flinch? Bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm? You smoke?
"Socially, a lot.",You do yoga and you smoke?
I know it's hypocritical but--,"Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs."
How would smoking cause--,"It wouldn't, just needed a lighter."
My god!,The case was looking so promising.
"Hey, I'm not faking.","You moved, therefore you can move. Get this lunatic out of here before she bores again."
"I heard you were watParkng surgery with a Patient's family. Talking to a Patient's family. It's because of your hallucination, isn't it? After you were shot? You chose life; you decided you wanted meaning, so you took a case with no mystery. Something any doctor could do. A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helping another huMan being.",She thanked me.
And... you felt nothing.,Wasn't Even sure what I was supposed to feel.
"Sorry, need you, again.",Told you to get rid of her.
"It's a good thing we didn't. Tightness in her chest, she can't breathe, it could be pleural effusion.",Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.
Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.,"Relax. I'm not going to burn you again. I'm going to STAB YOU! Look, either you're faking, or you've got a pleural effusion - that's a build-up of fluid around the lungs which is very serious - and I would have no choice but to stab you in the back with this needle and suck all the fluid out of you. So--"
We should give her a local.,That would defeat the point of me being nasty. Ready? Down.
But she can't breathe if she's down.,Down!
She can't breathe--,"Down! Down, down, down! Come on!"
PRoblem's in her heart.,Can't fake that.
Or vasculitis would also explain the effusion.,But not the paralysis. Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.
"She moved, therefore she could move. She wasn't paralyzed.","Ehh... doesn't mean she was faking, could have been a delusion. Now, either she was faking, and coincidentally got a real cardiac pRoblem at the exact same time, or it's a delusion and the fake paralysis is a real neurological symptom."
"And she's been scanned up and down, it's all clean.","So, open her up, and find it."
So what do you want us to do? Start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?,That should work.
That should work.,His heart rate's a little high.
Should I be worried?,PRobably just means he's still in discomfort from the surgery. I'm going to up his morphine a little.
You've been so nice to us.,That's the job.
"No, I mean all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the... the cancer, the treatment, the damage... just trying to fix him. You're the first doctor that's Ever given a damn about the quality of his life.","His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right."
What a touParkng moment. That's why we become doctors. For those rare moments when our hearts are warm--,Would you like to get a drink?
Are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject?,"No, I'm serious. I drink, you drink. We could do it at the same time, same table. Do you eat? We could do that too. I mean, if the answer's no that's cool but..."
"No, I... it's just... you're just coming off the surgery and you're not yourself yet and I work for you and Even though last year's... you're smiling! I'm saying no and you're smiling!","Oh, don't take it personally. Its just coz you're full of crap. You have no interest in going out with me. Maybe you did, when I couldn't walk and I was a sick puppy that you could nurture back to health. Now that I'm healthy, there's nothing in it for you."
You've been back at work 24 hours and you're already playing hide and seek in a Woman's spine.,Who won the pool?
"There's no tumor. Her platelets are normal, scans--",What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't Even notice.
Her Lawyers might. You're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other Patient.,"Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery."
What? You want a trade? We're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.,"You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences."
You tried to swap?,"Ran a few more tests, came back negative, surgery's on."
"You really don't give a crap, do you?",Does that make me evil?
Yeah.,"The girl's life is at stake, what we're talking about with the guy--"
What we're talking about is the reason you took the case; to help someone.,Too bad for them.
The fifth lEvel of happiness involves creation. Changing lives.,Sixth lEvel is heroin; sEventh lEvel is you going away.
"House, you're not--",I'm not an idiot. Move.
"House, leave her alone.","Close her up, you wanna know why?"
The room's no longer sterile.,"True, it's not the most interesting reason. That is not a sexy big toe. You'd nEver put that in your mouth."
What the hell has that got to do with--,Told you it was interesting; it gets Even better.
"The uh... nurse changed his morphine, I thought you were worried about--",It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.
So he won't have any pain?,Eventually.
Thank you.,Everything else will be the same.
"Well, you took away his pain and that, that changes a lot.",Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.
"Yeah. I could dump him there, except he's my husband. He's my son's father.",Right. Kids need a dad; someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.
Mark's learned that you don't have to abandon someone just because--,Get a dog.
I'm taking care of him for the same reason you helped us.,Some guy shot you and you hallucinated?
I have a responsibility.,"So he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down, sapping your energy, wasting your life - that's the meaning you take from this?"
I want to take care of him.,You enjoy this?
I can't abandon him.,"So you don't want to take care of him. Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy. But not taking care of him would make you miserable."
"I don't need your help, I've done this a million times.","Here, let me..."
"Here, let me...","Do that again, make that sound."
What was that?,That... was talking.
That... was talking.,You guys are lousy doctors. You're in such a rush to make the Patient feel better you forgot to check what was wrong.
"Yoga girl walked out of here 2 hours ago, you fixed her.","Not her, the other guy."
He had brain cancer; they removed it 8 years ago. His condition's been the same Ever since.,"Until last night, he spoke."
What'd he say?,Guhhhhhhh.
You want us to dissect 8 years of medical history with grunting in the differential?,Sounds good. Call me when you're done.
You're fabricating a mystery because you're bored.,I am not bored. Damn it.
You didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?,"Of course not, because then she would nEver have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy."
"The Vicodin dulled it, in the sober light of day I'm a buzz kill. You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked. Don't torture them, let it go, tell the wife it was only a grunt, tell her to go home.","Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope. Oh! I stuck that primo! How rad am I?"
"In 8 years the Patient experienced 214 symptoms, Many of them repeating.",Any patterns?
"If you add pain into the mix, fEver, frequent urination could indiCate a kidney pRoblem.",I like it.
"No, creatinine and BUN were both normal.","Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst."
"Perfect, you Managed to pick the one symptom he nEver had. Abdominal pain.",It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.,"No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'."
Richard's symptoms are culled from 8 years of medical history. They're not patterned. These are random individual Events over time.,Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.
"His throat will collapse, muscle degeneration in his neck won't tolerate the scope, it's an automatic trach!",You're talking about him like he's an invalid.
"Yeah, we're insensitive.","Does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight? Does he choke on his food? His neck's fine, his throat's not going to collapse. Cameron, get consent from the wife."
"We trached him, endoscopically removed the pRobe and he's breathing again. So, all in all, great idea.",Get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?
"Which means barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.",This Man nearly died. How can you discharge him?
"You stick something down someone's throat, they gag, spasm, which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.","Except that our Patient's throat was sedated. Which means the brain should have sent a signal not to do anything. This could be cancer, or some bizarre neuro-degeneration, Even a new type of vasculitis--"
Stop it. You're enjoying this.,I find it interesting.
It's interesting only if you're right; if you're wrong we're torturing this guy to amuse you.,Half hour to remove the pRobe?
House.,"It's not a spasm. His throat didn't collapse, it locked down. Brain is supposed to tell Every muscle in the body to relax and contract at the same time, this muscle was only contracting which means a signal from the brain was not getting through."
"There are no lesions on his brain, nothing to interrupt the new orders.",All it takes is one wire down.
You have no evidence of any wires down.,"A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death."
He will bleed into his brain!,"No, he won't."
Because that wouldn't be interesting. You can get permission this time.,The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--
Does this mean that the cancer's back?,"No, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no.","If we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new."
"So what, more surgery? More radiation?",Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might Even get some brain function back.
No!,But understanding what you're saying would be nice. Maybe you can figure out ways to communiCate.
You're lucky he didn't die.,I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.
We told you he'd hemorrhage.,"Told me he'd bleed into his brain, not out of his ear."
You've got to drop this.,We're missing something.
"We did a dangerous test and something bad happened, that's all this is.","Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman. Walk me through the scans. 1998, what happened?"
5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--,"Nothing. Next, a speck on the superior temporal region."
"It's a regrowth, benign.",Star thingy next to the Rathke cleft.
"House Every speck is not a suspect, its years of surgeons digging around in his head. Let him go.",Re-do Every blood test he's Ever had. Re-scan his head.
"No. He's been sick and suffering for 8 years, I'm not going to help you make it worse; I'm not going to help you make it interesting.","That's ok, Foreman's better at that stuff than you are. We need 5mm cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions."
How Many millimeters?,I can help him.
That's it? That's your argument?,Seems like a good one.
"If I thought for a second you wanted to help him, you'd have carte blanche. You're doing this because it's fun.",Does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives? My motives have nothing to do with the case.
Your motives have Everything to do with your judgment.,"For the first time in years I've got no opiates in my body, now you question my judgment."
"24 times a year you come storming into my office spouting that you can help someone. Only you nEver say those words, you say something like his pancreas is going to explode because his brain is on fire! You come here with medicine, not with platitudes.",I didn't want to bore you with the details.
The answer's no. Cuddy called 30 seconds after you left and said you'd try an end around.,My leg hurt.
How bad?,Enough that I'm telling you.
Did it go away?,Ached for a while. First time I felt anything there since the surgery.
But it went away?,"It was muscular, it was some cramping. What are you smiling about?"
"You're 40 something years old, you've been running God knows how Many miles a day, fallen a hundred times off that skateboard and you're shocked to have some soreness?",Just give me a prescription.
"For Vicodin? House, people get aParkng joints, cramps, they put on an ice pack, they take some ibuprofen.",I know what the pangs of middle age feel like.
"No, you don't, because you've been stuffing vicodin Every 5 minutes since you turned middle age.",The surgery didn't work.
Don't play me.,You think this is a scam?
"I think you want me to feel sorry for you and either do the end around on Cuddy or give you the drugs. Either way, you get the high you think you need. House, your surgery worked, you're fine. It's just going to take time for it to feel good.",Come on.
Come on.,"Circumventricular system sends his cytokines, releasing the early stages of the immune response but CDOS releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by antipyretic therapy. So yeah, his brain's on fire. The suicide attempt was not a suicide attempt; he drove that wheelchair into the pool because he couldn't regulate his body temperature. He had hypothalamic dysregulation."
And you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool?,Fountain. I can cure him.
"Cure him? Even if the fountain proved anything, fixing hypothalamic dysregulation isn't going to regenerate brain.","No, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is resting against the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down. Addison's disease."
"You didn't see any scar tissue on his MRI, his CT scan--",His brain is functional.
His temperature's normal. There is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary!,I can make him walk! I can make him talk!
This is a wild guess! That came to you because you were! sweating.,"Inject him with cortisol. The guy will have sex with his wife again, he'll hug his kid again. Hopefully that's the combination he was using, it'd be a shame if I'd cured a pedophile. You're smiling, that's a bad sign."
You're high.,"I told you, I haven't had anything in 3 months."
This is as high as you get. A theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow but you don't have a lick of substantiating proof.,"Your decision doesn't make any sense. There is no risk to a cortisol injection. If I'm wrong, big deal. He goes home a vegetable like he already is, but if I'm right--"
He's on his way out of here. Figure you'd be on your scooter racing down the halls to stab the Patient in the neck with cortisol.,She was right to say no. I had no objective reason to think that I was right. Just needed the puzzle.
Ah. Where's the sweat and the B.O? You've taken such pride bathing us in your personal musk.,Showered at home.
And yet you're earlier than usual.,"Is this an intervention? It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore. I am, howEver, still hooked on phonics."
If you still did your morning run and showered at home you'd be later than usual.,Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg? You seem to be favoring your left side.,I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world.
You've taken the stairs Every day.,Do I need a restraining order?
"Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, Parkcken pox at age five ""ï¿½","He Ever get his feelings hurt? I'll need to know that, too."
Maybe we should talk to the kid.,"Why, in case he's telling the truth? You're a beliEver, aren't you?"
"Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we're the only ones with life.",No. But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological pRoblems and bleeding disorders.,Perfect. Especially if there were neurological pRoblems.
"What part of ""hallucinating an alien abduction""ï¿½ isn't neurological?","Well, why is that a hallucination?"
"What? You think the kid ""ï¿½","He's having nightmares. Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything, other than wanting to sleep with Mommy. Which just leaves us with one symptom: the bloody tuchas, which can easily be explained by a GI pRoblem or a bleeding disorder. Check his coags with PT, PTT, and bleeding time. And prep him for endoscopies from above and below."
"His alien abduction story! the lEvel of detail is... I don't know where he gets it from. The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books ""ï¿½",Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.,So it's a simple bleeding disorder.
"No, blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.",So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test!,"So it's a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice. Either you screwed up the test, or I screwed up my analysis of this case. If you screwed up, I don't have to cry myself to sleep. It's a simple bleeding disorder. Foreman, redo the test."
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.,You sure?
Had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.,So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got them mixed up?,"Oh, snap! Foreman's playing the dozens; you're at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort."
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests. If we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which one's right.,"Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too."
House! Clancy's gone missing.,"Oh, no! Well, you take Alpha Centauri, Foreman can look on Tatooine, and Cameron can set up an intergalactic checkpoint. Let's pray he hasn't gone into hyperdrive! We'll nEver catch him."
"Clancy, stop! There is no Parkp! We're going to clean you up, and we're going to go back to your room. You can't do things like this. Your parents!",Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not Even be terrestrial.
Really?,"No, you idiot! It's titanium. Like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago, nice medical history."
"That pin was removed six months after ""ï¿½","So what, a little piece broke off during removal."
"Titanium is used to build nuclear subs, pieces don't just break off.",Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.
"To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.",Yeah. An alien Parkp makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn't actually screw up.
You okay?,"Fine. I tripped. Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck, apparently didn't bleed to death. Now that's weird."
He clotted on his own?,"Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there's not again."
Or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.,"Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm."
"He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.","Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness."
I'm open to suggestions.,"Solve the case. Kidneys could ""ï¿½"
Kidneys are clean.,Tell me he's a mutant huMan hybrid.
Right. Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.,"She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking."
"I meant, he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis. Maybe the two are related. What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?",Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand's could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction; he could have easily have been hypertensive.,I know I get worked up when I cut microParkp tracking implants out of my neck.
Sounds like a cheat to me.,"Yeah, we get it. Okay, what's the differential for a sEven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?"
"It's clean, his heart isn't the pRoblem.",Why don't I have hi-def in my office? I'm a department head!
Valves are intact.,Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.,"See, this is what I'm talking about. Foreman, you've got to steal this thing for me."
"The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears. The pRoblem's got to be somewhere else.",We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?,There.
Where?,"Right there. Left side, no movement. Well, don't freeze it! Something's not moving, how do you see something not move if nothing's moving? I need the laser pointer."
We don't have a laser pointer.,"Well, why not? Who's going to take us seriously if we don't have a laser pointer? Right here! A few thousand myocytes not beating with the rest."
So you found an arrhythmia.,"That's not an arrhythmia, that's a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren't moving at all. Go get me those myocytes; I want to talk to them in my office."
How's the kid doing?,"Heart nearly exploded. Still beating, though. Most of it, anyway. Why do they bother putting age restrictions on these things when all you have to do is click, ""Yes, I am 18""ï¿½? Even a 17-year-old can figure that out."
What's going on with the leg?,"First, tell me what's going on with the boobs."
"If you're feeling pain ""ï¿½",They're firmer.
It's called an underwire. I want to get a PET scan of your brain.,I think it's hormones.
"As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus ""ï¿½",Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
"-- Then the pain can be good. It could be muscle regenerating. After you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.",Guess I should be saying 'mazel tov.' Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant. I need to get a PET scan of your brain.,Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant!,My leg doesn't hurt.
You're in denial!,"No, I'm not! Oh, you got me. If I thought my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prEvent that?"
Okay.,Gotta go.
"Here's Clancy's DNA, and here's the DNA from the piece of that heart we just biopsied.",That is impossible. Run it again.
Alien DNA.,Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA could become mutated. Extreme UV radiation.,"That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow."
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.,"So first Daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist."
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.,"Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia, or both."
Is your leg hurting?,Is that question helping?
You're leaning.,You're sitting.
You're evading.,"My head's hurting. Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA."
What if we find the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?,Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
"It's the same way we search for cancer. The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells. We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein and we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.","Okay, let's do that."
You want to go for a run?,What do you want?
I want you to run.,When did you become an enabler?
"I'm enabling you to exercise. Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.",I'd rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day.
"You're just like any other Patient ""ï¿½ running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.",I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off. That it was just a tortuous window of the good life.,What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?,It's my leg. We've known each other a long time.
We didn't miss anything. Brain scan was completely clean.,Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don't use an IV this time; get it right into the brain.
"His scan was clean, twice! It's not there!","What if it is there but didn't show up on the scan? What if the tag just doesn't work in his brain? Brain cells are structurally different, express a different protein."
Where are we going?,I am going to think.
I am going to think.,Send the kid home.
What do you mean?,Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized and send him home.
Like nothing Ever happened?,"We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find."
"We don't know that we fixed anything, it's only been a day. Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.",It's more pRobable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.,"May be epilepsy, may be psychological, may be nothing. If the kid gets sick again it'll give us another clue, we can start searParkng again. If he doesn't, it doesn't matter. Send him home."
House! You're just giving up on this kid?,You've got to know when to stop.
"You don't stop, you nEver stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.",Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic. Just forget the last case. This kid obviously has something wrong with him.,"When did you dEvelop such strong opinions about my Patients? Last week you were convinced that my Patient wasn't sick, now you're convinced this one is."
"This one is a young boy. His parents are desperate. Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours ""ï¿½","Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That's where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely."
"If you have reason to beliEve that that might help ""ï¿½","I'm not going to start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you'd give me the green light."
I just want you to do something.,You've been overly supportive this entire week. Either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden. And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
I'm not pregnant.,Then what did you do wrong?
"He had Addison's, your last Patient. You were right. I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.","Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to ""ï¿½"
"Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to ""ï¿½",How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
We've been through this.,Our assumptions are faulty.
"We've confirmed two different sets of DNA, we re-ran the sequence.","I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty. We assumed he's a person."
"Of course, the aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.","Well, you're being silly. What if he's not a person, what if he's two persons?"
I'm not getting the metaphor.,"No metaphor. Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?"
"Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.","The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something. Back when he was really young, I mean really young, I mean twelve cells young. In vitro increases the likelihood of twinning."
But he doesn't have a twin.,"Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop. So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth. PRoblem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They nEver untangle. He's two people in one. It's called Parkmerism."

Clancy's body thinks that he's going to put away the easy winners, but his brother just keeps swatting the balls into the net. We've got to get him off the court."
"So does that mean you can find the bad cells in his brain, or not?","Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine. Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks. If we induce an alien abduction ""ï¿½"
"Wait, what the hell are you talking about?","The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him beliEve that he's being abducted. We stimulate those neurons with an electric pRobe; we can trick your son's brain into hallucinating. And your son's neurons will light up, and his brother's cells will remain dark. Those are the ones we cut out."
You're talking about brain surgery.,"I'm talking about really cool brain surgery. One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying any more."
Light bulb.,Start us out at ten.
I'm not doing that.,"That was all me, kid. Sorry."
Brain waves indiCate mild hallucination. Neurons lighting up.,Any dark spots?

"Yep, we got them all.",Close him up.
Everything's going to be normal again.,You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull?
What now?,"She lied to me. She cured my Patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it."
That doesn't sound like her.,"You're right. It does sound like you, though."
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?,"Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now. So, what was the plan? That I'd feel so humble by missing a case that I'd reevaluate my entire life, question nature, truth, and goodness and become Cameron?"
"Something like that. More that if we told you the truth; that you'd solved the case based on absolutely no medical proof, that you'd think you were God. And I was worried your wings would melt.",God doesn't limp.
"You're not gonna make this easy, are you? Unfortunately; as much as I admire your spirit, je ne sais rien.","71 year old cancer research specialist. Minor tremors, localized melanoma removed 2 years ago, cataracts. And he can't breathe. Also, disregard the facial lacerations. They're creepy, but unfortunately irrelevant. Don't you wanna know why?"
You! have your cane.,"No, why the lacerations are creepy. He was about to dissect one of his lab rats when he collapsed. The little vermin seized the day, so to speak and went mEdieval on his ass. What, my fly open?"
So the! the pain's returned.,"There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe."
We're talking about you.,"Obviously. I'm obviously not. What is it with you people? I don't use the cane, you're shocked. I use the cane!"
We're just concerned.,"About the wrong person. I can breathe. Ezra Powell on the other hand, is gonna die."
The researcher? The guy who wrote that textbook?,"*That* textbook, THE textbook."
Wait - there's actually another doctor you admire?,"I! admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe."
"So's his EKG, it's not his heart.","You're being too nice. Outside the hospital he can't breathe, inside the hospital he can. Means we help, at least enough to screw with our test results. The source of the pRoblem's either in his heart or his lungs. So all we gotta do is stop helping, put a little pressure on him, and see which gives out first."
"At 71, we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get 'em to give in again.",That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital. Put him on an incline treadmill and do a stress EKG.
"Stop, this isn't working.",His heart rate barely got above 90.
"He can't run, he can hardly walk.","It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up."
Exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.,They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.
You don't need a $400 handbag.,It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.
What's that?,"Cold. Take this 4 times a day, and stay off airplanes. Flying cesspools."
Dr. House!,Please don't get up. I'm sure you're very busy. I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.
"No, he's right, let him -- let him do it.",See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.
He can't breathe.,130. The magic number. Nothing here. Foreman?
Still no sign of blockage.,"Which means it's not the heart. So it must be the lungs. See? That wasn't so hard, was it?"
He's thought this through; it's not an impulsive decision.,Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.
"He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to rEverse it.",You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.
"Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.","Wow. Certainly a lot of interesting things to consider. Stress EKG rules out the heart, which means something's gotta be attacking his lungs. Mycoplasmas or strep pneumo, which pRobably means it's too late to do anything about it. We could try levofloxacin."
Coming up with a new treatment isn't gonna do us any good unless we convince him it's worth trying.,"Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatEver we want to him."
You're wasting your time. There must be other Patients you could actually help.,"No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis."
"House, you're hurting him.","You're hurting me. Fine; you don't help us, we don't help you. Your lungs slowly fill with fluid. You gasp to catch Every breath but nEver can. Every breath is petrifying. It'll be slow, painful; torturous."
"We don't choose our birth, and we don't choose our death.","What if you could? How 'bout we make a deal? Give me one more day. If I don't find out exactly what's wrong with you by then, I help you die."
House!,"24 hours. Come on, it's not gonna kill you."
You canNOT help him kill himself.,Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time.
Cuddy's not gonna let you!,"Enough! You don't want me to kill him. Fine. Here's a big shock; I don't wanna kill him either. How do I not kill him? By you guys doing your job. We have 24 hours to figure out what's wrong with him. Tick tock, tick tock."
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia; should be bacteria in his blood.,It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.
"Not if I spin down the sample. Separate off the buffy coat, then gram stain for bacteria.","Great. Do an Amylase, D-dimer, C-reactive peptide, get a urine, and do a bronParkal sputum while you're at it. You check his home and lab for radiation and toxins. And do a bone marrow biopsy."
All of that in 24 hours?,Nah. WhatEver you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.
Purple dye on my fingers.,What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?
Don't have the results.,What? What've you been doing all night?
Who's that?,Your protï¿½gï¿½. What are these?
Dictation tapes. He records Everything.,Why?
Because he's a diligent researcher?,Or he's losing his memory.
A lot of people dictate their notes.,"Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing. Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatEver's in his lungs, is also in his brain. Unless you got something more promising."
I'll go get an MRI of his head.,Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile.
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia; he a drinker?,Not according to the history.
"Which means yes, he drinks, which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity.",Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.
"But your entire view of huMan nature gets destroyed. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.",Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.
"Head is clean. You were wrong, his faculties are intact.","Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says."
It's 4 o'clock; we have nothing to tell him.,Then we have no reason to talk to him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.
"Yup, we have. No buds, no hyphae.","Okay. Next procedure; we sneak in, turn back the clock."
Whole team. Must be bad news.,"Nope. Bone marrow biopsy rEvealed multiple myeloma. It's not good news, but there are some treatments. We have to draw some blood!"
What about my breathing?,Associated hyperviscosity syndrome; gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs.
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.,Mm. We call him Dr. Idiot.
There's no M-protein in my urine.,Odd presentation.
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't beliEve it either.,Just give me 12 more hours.
We had a deal. No more tests.,Fair enough. Give me six more hours. Listen; there is no evidence that you are terminal.
You a Man of your word or not?,"No, as a matter of fact, I'm not."
Nowhere.,Everybody who can walk should get outta here.
You can't do that.,Can't do what? Administer a prescription painkiller to a Patient who's in pain? Go. Make sure somebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria.
No it's about whether you die or we murder you.,What's gonna happen here is that someone's getting a butt-load of morphine. I'm not sure exactly who at this point.
Thank you. I've always wondered exactly what was on the other side.,Nothing.
What are you doing?,"Getting a laryngoscope. Don't just stand there, help."
"But you told him ""ï¿½","Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night."
"Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.",We can legally assume that he'd consent to whatEver a reasonable person would consent to.
And a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.,"I try to kill him, you're mad. I don't kill him you're mad."
All he wanted was some dignity.,"Were you in that room with him? Was he wearing a tux while he was choking on his own plasma? Keep doing the tests. Take your time, do it right. Go. Get to work. Wait! Cameron, why'd you do these cuts so far down on this MRI of his head?"
"I wanted to get his brain-stem and his C-spine, make sure his diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.",You also caught the top of his lungs. There's scarring. You do know that you can't really pierce me with your stares.
Or Lupus.,"He can kill himself after we get him better. Start him on an IVIG for the Lupus, and get a colonoscopy. Lupus could be hiding there."
I can't do this.,Drama queen.
I don't think she's gonna have a pRoblem deciding what to tell Cuddy. O2 sats 89 and dropping.,Thought you were only supposed to put on a pound a week during your last trimester.
I'm not pregnant. I heard about your little stunt with Dr. Powell.,"Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink."
A lie.,"Ok. Lying is sometimes good, right? Like when you're trying to teach someone a lesson about humility, or something. All I'm trying to do is save his life. He's not gonna learn anything; I just thought the same principle might apply."
It does.,I coulda just let him die.
Not gonna get sued for keeping him alive.,"Well, we could; we completely disregarded his wishes."
Do you want me to disagree with you? Want me to yell at you?,It is comforting.
"We're doctors: We treat Patients, we don't kill them.","How right you are, Dr. Cuddy! We also don't pad our bills, swipe samples from the pharmacy, or fantasize about the teenage daughters of our Patients, either."
I'm sorry about your leg.,Yeah. We really should spend some time talking about that.
The IVIG made him worse. O2 stats plummeted.,So we know it's not Lupus. What else could it be?
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,Gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm.
"So, now we're going to operate on the guy?",Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.
Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,"When you searched Dr. Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal?"
Why?,"I just figured, if you're not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold's a killer."
How's your leg?,It hurts. It's gonna keep on hurting. You gonna keep on asking?
How's Ezra Powell?,Resting comfortably.
"Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.",I hate practicing medicine in high school.
He's not asking you to help him kill himself; he's just asking for help. The disease will kill him.,I know what he was asking for; I just said 'no'.
You've done it before. Plenty of times.,To Patients that I knew were terminal.
"Oh, give me a break. This has nothing to do with saving a life; you just can't bear the thought of a Patient dying before you've been able to figure out why.",If we're gonna keep refusing to cure Patients just to rein in my ego then we might start having a little pRoblem with Patient recruitment.
Worried about meeting your one Patient a week quota?,"I'm a cripple, remember. Accommodations must be made."
Why'd you have me look up that article?,Didn't you find it interesting?
He injected newborn babies with radioactive agents just to see if they had urethral reflux.,He was curious.
He didn't Even tell their parents he was doing an experiment.,He wasn't doing anything his peers weren't doing.
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?!,He ignored the rights of the few to save Many.
So you're okay with what he did.,Doesn't matter what I think. It's what you think that's relevant.
"Because, if I think less of him, I'll help you more? You're wrong. The fact that a Patient did bad things doesn't change anything. He still deserves to have some control over his own body.","If he had control of his own body, he'd be dead."
Some control. We can withhold treatment without killing him.,"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can't have it both ways."
"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die; you can't have it both ways.",Well I guess it's not IPF.
Well I guess it's not IPF.,"Well, maybe he'll die right now. Make Everything easy for all of us."
BP's low.,"No breath sounds on the right side; he's dropped his right lung. Air's building up in his chest, compressing his heart."
What are you doing?,"Withdraws from pain stimuli on the left side, but not the right."
Those are just reflex arcs; he's under anesthesia.,Or he's lost sensation in some places.
Or the hypoxia from the arrest stunned his CNS.,Only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.
We can't do that while he's in a coma.,Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes.
Won't work. He needs muscle relaxants to be on the ventilator.,Only one more way to tell. Pupillary reflexes.
All that tests is the brainstem.,"See, I was right; only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials."
I just said we can't do that while he's in a coma.,So wake him up.
So wake him up.,Don't go towards the light. You'll fall and break your hip.
What's happening? I --,You took a little nap.
"No, I! I told you I didn't want --","Sorry, little deaf in one ear. Your bone marrow was hypocellular; we ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis, but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves."
"So, this is all a waste, a huge fail! failure. Impossible, you're Gregory House.",We need to attach some sensors to your skin.
No.,"Look, we can't do what you want; we've assigned a nurse to watch you so you can't do it either. So, you might as well just let us do the test."
Then take them out!,"Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs; you'll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests."
"Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs; you'll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests.","Ok. But first, let's clean you up a little. That feel nice?"
What are you trying to prove?,"Just cleaning him up. What's it look like? Pay no attention to the Man behind the curtain. House runs his thumb down Ezra's right foot, and there is no reaction. He does the same to his left, and this time the foot twitches.]"
Get out!,"Okay, I'm going already. Can't you see I'm a cripple?"
"Ok, so you got me curious.",I was right; whatEver is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves.
You got that by splashing ice water on him?,"No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology's overrated."
That means the clean MRI of his brain means it's just affecting the peripheral nerves.,And bone marrow.
Or sarcoidosis.,All potentially treatable. Question is which. We need to catch the little bastards in the act. What's the largest organ?
Skin.,We need to get a piece.
"Sure, we'll just wait until he leaves his room without his skin, sneak in, and take a piece.",I want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy.
And I wanna get a foot massage from Johnny Damon.,"Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis are all treatable."
And it could be a hundred other things that aren't treatable. You have no idea.,But you do; you know Everything.
I didn't say that I -,"Exactly! You can't decide if we're helping or hurting him; if he's good or bad; or if you want paper, plastic, or a burlap sack. Do your damn job."
I'm not gonna lie to him.,"Fine, tell the truth. Just get me a pound of flesh."
"Dr. House? Hi, how are you?",Not as good as you think I am.
"Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My dad just lost his medicine; he had to come back for another prescription.","Yeah, right. He's moving it on the street, isn't he?"
Why haven't you returned any of my calls?,I plan to. In a couple of years.
I was just calling to say 'thank you.' And to tell you how impressed I was; you diagnosed my dad by just looking at him.,"Felt his glands, too."
"Oh, there's my dad; I gotta go.",Yeah. Me too.
"It's not Kawasaki's, either. What's next?",Congo red.
Amyloidosis?,What the hell else would I mean by 'Congo red?'
There's no reason for it to be on the list.,"An abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body; shutting down his organs one by one. Explains Everything; the infiltrates on the x-ray, the bone marrow, kidney failure."
"We rejected Amyloidosis, because it didn't fit the first symptom we found. It would affect his heart.",It did.
It wasn't on the stress test.,We didn't push him hard enough. Add the stain; let's find out.
Congo red added.,"Change the polarization of the light, already."
How the hell you pull that out of --,Not outta mine. I had a muse.
Dr. House.,"You have Amyloidosis; it's in your lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain."
Why should I beliEve you now?,"If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA. It's terminal."
Ezra Powell passed away last night. I'm sure you already knew about that.,No. I just got in.
"The nurse charted at 2 AM; he was stable. Breathing labored, but regular. And at 2:30 he suddenly stopped. You know anything about that?","If I did, would you really wanna know?"
"If I did, would you really wanna know?",I'm proud of you.
"That's impossible, it's mac and cheese.",10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.
"He's autistic, sEverely autistic. Can't talk, can't make eye contact. Screaming's pRobably his way of communicating.",And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.
"Wow, so clearly that can't be the answer. His brain can't filter information, it's a constant assault on his senses I'd scream too.",Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia. Parents are convinced that there's something wrong with their son.
Since when do we start believing parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?,"Elevator. Dad was on Wall Street, mom was a partner in an accounting firm, when their son was diagnosed with autism they both quit."
"So they're overprotective and scared, that's all the more reason to--","They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital."
ER said the heart was fine.,Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.
Where are we going?,"Down. Stool sample to check for parasites, blood culture to rule out infection and ANA for lupus."
"Could also be an environmental reaction; an allergy, dust, wheat, pollen, a toxin.","Check the House. Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?"
"I had a date last night, she screamed. Should we spend a 100,000 dollars testing her?","Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing! Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--"
That's not what I'm saying!,"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys."
"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys.",I want my old carpet back.
Err; we're going to have to do this later. A kid in the clinic had an accident. Generally when people are on the phone--,I want my old carpet back.
"It was stained, with blood.","Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it."
You think you can get me to do anything you want regardless of how stupid it is?,"It's my office; it's where I work, where I think, where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops. I want it back the way it was."
"It's identical to the old carpet, except without the hazardous biological waste.",I shall not return to my office until Every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.
"Inspiring. If you don't want to work in your office, work in the clinic. You don't want to work in the clinic, go home and don't get paid.",Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica?
Hey doctor House.,Hello girl whose name I don't remember but whose dad I treated so I don't really know why she's here.
Ali. Umm... I think I caught what my dad has. The rhino thing.,Right. Does that hurt?
A little. It's in my chest too.,"Of course it is. Kinda had access through the shirt, this'll work."
That feels good.,Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-yr-old boys?
"The ventilation scan was normal, time to send him home.","Can't leave right now. Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing."
A rhinovirus? You can't leave because she has a cold?,Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.
"Hey, don't start with me. We're backed up.",I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.
What'd she do to your office?,"It's unusable. So, whatEver's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's House?"
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.,We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear?
Should we do this some place else?,"Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here."
"No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.",And since I can't work in my office.
Is this your master plan? Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?,"Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie. Fecal smear, talk to me!"
Get out of here.,Put back my carpet?
No! Get out of here!,"Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?"
"Do what you want, not replacing your carpet.","Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel."
Adam!,So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?
Why are we in here? This is some sort of power play?,Yeah. So you stuck your finger in the kid and gave him a pleural effusion. You Ever considered getting a Manicure?
Or do you really have a pRoblem with the carpeting? Change sets you off--,"I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B."
Why now? Why a power play now?,I smelled weakness. Get the kid an echocardiogram.
"That's funny; it says Wilson, what a strange typo.",The fluid comes back in exudate; get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.
No pRoblem.,Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.
"You share stories, feelings... toys. You don't share offices.",That is so not Zen.
"It was a gift, some doctors get those.",So you want mornings or afternoons?
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable so you're going to make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?,Yep.
What makes you think I can make her miserable?,Because you're good at that stuff.
"Ohhh, I'm nothing compared to you.",Is there anything you'll throw out?
"That's a gift from an 11-yr-old Patient of mine, she and I both knew it was a piece of junk and that's what made her laugh.",So you gotta keep it until she!
What are you doing here? I have this room booked from 2 to 3.,"Oh, 2 East coast time? I thought you meant Pacific, which is stupid of me I guess. What about parasites?"
It's 2 o' clock.,"Oh well, we should go then. That just leaves cancer. Get a lung biopsy."
It took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!,"Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?"
"House, can we talk?",Carpet?
NEver.,Nothing to talk about.
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.,"Huh. A lot to discuss, Parkna patterns--"
"House, she's a stalker.","Right, couldn't be that she finds me interesting and attractive. Has to be that she's insane."
She's called you 15 times; your mother's not that interested in you.,Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.
I'm notifying security.,Is this about the carpet? Do you think I'll back off if you block all my fun?
You better not be having fun!,I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.
She's dangerous!,She's not dangerous.
She's pretty.,She's pretty.
Men are stupid.,I'm with you so far.
I'm notifying security.,"Oh, give her a break, she's not dangerous, she's... insightful. You can't stop our love!"
"Still, just to be safe, you mind?","For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here. Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?"
Who are you?,Somebody you'll nEver send a gift to.
"This is doctor House, your son's doctor.","High test please. Hey, hey, hey!"
What are you doing?,Eating the red berries.
He trusted you.,"No, that wasn't trust. That was self-preservation."
"No, that was huge. It was like a conversation.","Monkey's afraid to eat the red berries until he sees another monkey eat them. Monkey see, monkey do, that's all it was. Your kid's still just as messed up as when we admitted him."
That was sensitive.,You have pretty hair.
Hope is all those parents have going for them.,"No, hope is what's making them miserable. What they should do is get a cocker spaniel. A dog would look them in the eye, wag his tail when he's happy, lick their face, show them love."
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal Parkld? It's normal to want to be normal.,"Spoken like a true circle queen. See skinny socially privileged white people get to draw this neat little circle, and Everyone inside the circle is normal, anyone outside the circle should be beaten, broken and reset so they can be brought into the circle. Failing that, they should be institutionalized or worse, pitied."
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?,"Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading? This kid doesn't have to pretend to be interested in your back pain or your excretions or your grandma's itchy place. Can you imagine how liberating it would be to live a life free of all the mind-numbing social niceties? I don't pity this kid, I envy him."
Liver cells.,Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.
Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.,Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,"Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?"
But we're not talking about cancer cells.,"So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?"
"Cancer cells are damaged lets them go into blood vessels, go wherEver they want.",So if the liver cells are damaged...
Liver isn't damaged. The tests were normal.,"So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, Even the heart issues."
"Liver cells are fine, he was immunized for Hep A and B and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?","Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral. Just leaves a lot of boozerosis."
"House, when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver, there was no scarring.","Cirrhosis explains the symptoms; heart pRoblems, lungs."
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.,How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.
They quit their jobs for him.,"Yes, they are Everything you'd want in a parent. Unfortunately their kid is nothing you'd want. When a baby is born, it's perfect; little fingers, little toes, plump, perfect, pink, and brimming with unbridled potential. Then it's downhill, some hills steeper than others. Parents get off on their kid's accomplishments. Cute! They'll annoy you with trophy rooms and report cards. Hell they'll Even show you a purple cow and tell you what a keen eye for color their kid has. But this kid, he doesn't smile, he doesn't hug them, he doesn't laugh. His parents get nothing, the right to brag that their kid picked orange juice out of a line-up."
So you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.,"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy."
"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",My parents love me unconditionally. Get out of here.
Not doing it.,Liver biopsy?
They're doing it now.,How's it going?
"Like a biopsy; needles, cells, screaming.",What'd you find in the stool sample?
"You were too busy bothering Cuddy, as discussed it was negative for parasites. Can we get out of here?",I didn't ask what you didn't find; I asked what you did find in the stool sample.
"Stool. And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate, can we leave?",What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?
What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?,"Uh oh, too late."
Leave my stuff alone!,You're meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes wearing that?
"I'm going to count to 3 and then, I'm going to fire you. One.","Calcium carbonate, that's uhh... antidiarrheal, right?"
Two.,"Think that's significant? Think hard poops are significant? Two and a half? NEver threaten unless you're ready to deliver, makes you look weak. Thank god you don't have Parkldren."
Doctor Cuddy.,Take a message.
Your Patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.,"Wow, that's like the one thing that would get me out of here."
"He's stable for the moment, first degree atrioventricular block.","Okay, what else do we know?"
Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis. Parents didn't poison their son.,"It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool."
"He's constipated, parents pRobably just overdid it.",Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.
"So he ate some chalk, it isn't toxic, sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.",Forget the chalk.
You just said it was about the chalk.,"Yes, and then I said forget the chalk, you must be very confused. This kid's got pica. Take him to a buffet he's going to eat the table."
LEvel of lead in the blood was normal. His tox screen was clean.,"We're not looking for typical poisons we're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth; matches, spiders, bricks."
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.,"Even better. Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House; bag Everything."
Hey.,You can get into a lot of trouble being here.
I wanted to see you.,"Yeah, I got that. So did Everyone else, they think you're a stalker."
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.,Yes I actually made that argument.
You going home?,That's the plan.
In Iceland the age of consent is 14.,I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.
So today I'm jailbait but in 22 weeks anybody can do anything to me. Will I be so different in 22 weeks?,22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.
It's just a line; an arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad old men in Robes.,"Yeah, who cares what Judges think."
Didn't think of you as a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.,You are over 10 years younger than me. I said over.
You are over 10 years younger than me. I said over.,Gotta go!
House.,"Doctor Cuddy, do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate? This young Woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions."
Security was going to call the police; I don't want to do that to you. Go home.,She needed a ride.
"She got here on her own she can get home on her own. Now! And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.","After that look I'm feeling a little frisky, looks like you're up."
"I'm ovulating, let's go.",The frisky it went away.
"House, this isn't a game.",If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back?
No.,If I forget about my carpet can I have her?
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.,I'm not trying to upset Cuddy; I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the Patient. Continue.
Jimson weed doesn't explain the screaming.,You've obviously nEver had a bad trip.
I would have thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.,Why can't you be more like the other age inappropriate girls who have a thing for me? Just accept me for me. Continue.
He won't survive 3 days.,What time does he wake up?
7.35am.,Then what? Walk me through it.
"7.40 - 7.50 he goes to the toilet, washes his face, what does this matter?",I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.
His schedule has nothing to do with Jimson weed.,"There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks."
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.,So what do we do? Nothing? Wait for the kid to tell us? What?
Where are you going?,To talk to him.
To talk to him.,Ever see your son eat a bush?
I've only Ever seen him eat leftover--,"Adam! Did you eat something at your House, something that made you sick? I need you to show me what you ate."
He can't answer you.,"Neither can you. This is your backyard; you may know it as Mel's Diner. Here's your sandbox, your jungle gym, under it is this. I need to know if you ate this, Adam."
He doesn't know what you want.,"Adam, you have to tell me because if you don't, it'll be game over, you'll be dead."
What the hell are you doing?,Show me what you ate. Adam! Show me what you ate.
Honey? Adam!,"Come on in, brothers and sister. Welcome to the House of the Lord!"
"House, come on, the chapel?",We have been blessed with the miracle of a new symptom. Brother can you testify as to why this poor Parkld's eyeball rolled back into his head?
"It's consistent with Jimson weed poisoning, ocular paralysis. Sorry.","The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted."
MS.,It is easier for a wise Man to gain access to heaven!
"Stroke, bleed in the brain.","We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified."
"It's a micro tumor. Started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion, then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. And then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.",So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?
"I've a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look. So, unless you have a better idea, I'm going to go CT his head and then if I have to, remove his eye.",You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.
Hello? Hello? Hello? I have sad news for you. She doesn't love you.,You're ugly when you're jealous.
"She showed up at my House last night, came on to me.",She's Even more perfect than I thought.
House! She's sick.,"You say sick, I say freestyling."
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.,"Come on, you're not that bad."
She has a pRoblem. You're not doing her any favors by indulging her!,Why would you lie like this? Do you not have room in your heart for love?
You don't beliEve me.,"I didn't beliEve the kids when they said that Suzie was sleeping with Johnny. Didn't beliEve them then I don't beliEve them now, I don't care that Suzie married Johnny, he's mine."
She has a mole on her right breast just below the nipple.,No she doesn't.
You've seen her breasts?!,"It was a medical exam. I was listening to her heart; it went ""Greg House, Greg House, Greg House""."
"Fine, I'm lying. But she did come back, she's locked up in my office, I was hoping you could talk to her, put an end to this.",Listen to me; do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a jail.
You're only saying that to make me go.,"I'm saying it 'coz it's true. Inside of us, we both know that you belong with Victor. Is there a Victor in your class? Well if you're not with someone your age, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."
What about us?,"We'll always have Fresno. I'm no good at being noble but it doesn't take much to see that the pRoblems of two little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now, here's looking at you-- Damn. Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno?"
What?,I ask all my girlfriends that.
Umm... yeah a little one.,Damn.
What? What is it?,"It's not love, you have spore in your brain; Coccidioides immitis. California's full of them, they get an earthquake they get released into the air, you breathe it in you get a cold, turns into sinus congestion, aches, weakness, milky tears and sometimes loss of inhibition and judgment. Damn!"
"So loving you, wanting to have sex with you is all just the spores talking?",You'll pRobably live. Damn!
You'll pRobably live. Damn!,Hey! Don't touch his eye!
This is an appendectomy.,"Like I said, don't touch his eye."
"Like I said, don't touch his eye.",Why isn't he in surgery?
Some emergency bumped him; we've got another room in 10 minutes.,"Better not take him in, kill the lights. He's seeing them all the time."
What are you looking for?,"He's telling us what he's seeing, telling us exactly what was wrong with him, drawing them for us over and over again. Nobody knew how to speak autistic. When I asked him what he ate he Even told me that."
What are you talking about? What was he seeing?,"Hello my pretties. It's not a tumor, Foreman, it's worms swimming in his eye. Animal makes potty in the sandbox, boy plays in the sandbox, boy eats the sand, you can pRobably tell where this is going by now."
Stool samples were negative for parasites.,Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their huMan host.
Cameron tested the sand.,"All of it? Worms spread from his gut to the rest of his body. Attacked his lungs, that's what made him scream and caused the effusion. Invade his liver sending dead liver cells coursing through his system, it attacked his eye and the muscles surrounding it making his eyeball do a back flip. Laser photo coagulation can fix the eye and high dose of benzimidazole should kill the worms."
"Wait a minute, that's it? He's going to be ok?","Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time."
"You're not autistic; you don't Even have Asperger's. You wish you did, it would exempt you from the rules, give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility, let you date 17-yr-olds. But most important it would mean that you're not just a jerk.","At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk? First tongue kiss, an 8 on the happiness scale. Your Parkld being snatched back from the brink of death, that's a 10. They're clocking in at a very tepid 6.5 because they know what they have to go back to."
You saved his life.,"Yeah I know, see ya."
20-yr-old married African-American female couldn't breathe. Anaphylaxis-like throat-swelling.,Parkldren?
You think pregnancy would explain the--,It explains the marriage. Who the hell gets married at 20?
I'm guessing people in love?,Show me a 20-yr-old who's not in love. You get married at 20 you're going to be shocked at who you're living with at 30.
"Not allergies, negative on the skin test - 4 days of antihistamines and steroids.",Who's he talking to?
What?,"It's got an ass, technically that makes it a who."
Uhh... new nurse in Peds. Wendy something. Swelling just started to go down.,You seen her here before?
Swelling's--,"You think that's funny, ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane."
"There was a point to it. Wendy, this is House.",Something about not getting too uppity with normal folks who walk good.
Why so rude?,"You sprinted through 3 bad marriages, into an affair with a dying Patient - now a naughty nurse? How Many more failed relationships are we both going to have to deal with before you learn to love yourself? And I mean that in a literal way."
It's amazing how you can not only know it's a relationship but that it's a bad relationship based on nothing but... nothing.,I know you.
"I'm not with her, not Even trying.","You're lying to me, that's interesting."
Swelling is--,Why is she hanging out here?
Anyone interesting in what happened with the swelling?,"She's in Peds, it's the next wing over."
"Clearly he did and Wilson denied it, and House doesn't beliEve him. It's gotta hurt, that's why it pays to have more than one friend, House.",If he's not hitting that then why's she here?
"Because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot. Swelling took 4 days to resolve, Patient has unexplained intensive abdominal pains.",So explain them. Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy. Anybody know her? Know her story?
"Up an' at 'em. They did a laparotomy. Liver, bowel, gall bladder, appendix all clean.",Belly pain plus throat swelling.
"Sorry, take it back, that's a stretch.",Got a better idea? Then stretch away. Start her on floroquinolone for the salmonella.
I was waiting 2 hours out there.,Fascinating. Have you considered a career as a memoirist? Let's see it.
You don't introduce yourself?,"Sorry, I thought you were waiting 2 hours, didn't know you wanted to chat. Hi, I'm Greg. How 'bout that local sports team? It's not an infection."
How can you tell--,You want me to touch you? It's your private place. You're chewing nicotine gum which causes dehydration which causes wear and tear. Try a lubricant or foreplay if you're cheap.
"Just take a swab and get it tested, ok?","Sorry, already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots."
You're rude.,"Wow, you're like a... detective or something."
"And you're smart, and you're funny but you are bitter. And you're lonely, so you treat Everyone around like they're idiots and you get away with it because of your cane.","Please stop, it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears."
"But you're not actually getting away with it. Last nurse you made fun of, she pRobably slipped some crap into your coffee.","Nyeah, I asked for decrappinated coffee."
Thank you.,Bend over.
You're kidding me.,"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to vacation elsewhere."
"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to vacation elsewhere.","And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Uh uh, you break it, you bought it."
"And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.",Leaving early today. Did you Ever get that thing where you're sure you've forgotten something but you can't figure out what? Guess it can't be that important.
We should switch her to a different antibiotic.,Why?
We can't treat the salmonella unless--,Salmonella? That was a total stretch.
"Man, why does that sound so familiar? You think it's 'coz I said it an hour ago?","Then it was a dumb thing to say, now it's smart. She's got the rash so we know she's unusually susceptible to allergic reactions so that's what brought her in. PRobably the peanut butter in her sandwich."
Stick test was negative for peanuts.,That's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.
"Exercise-based anaphylaxis? Think that requires exercise. When her throat closed they'd just got done eating, not Even competitive eating.",And getting Robbed. Always gets my heart rate up. Give her the same food she ate at the diner and stick her on the treadmill.
"Better yet put a gun to her head, threaten to rape her.",You don't think I'm going to get a response?
No.,"You're on, 50 bucks."
I'm not betting on a Patient's--,A hundred bucks? If you say so.
"He's as sick as she is, now.",Told you it would work.
It worked on the wrong Patient.,We can spend all day arguing right and wrong. Give me the hundred bucks.
We didn't bet!,We could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not. Give me the hundred bucks.
"Husband's test showed no MI. No aortic dissection. It's not his heart, it's just nonspecific chest and abdominal pain.","So, psychosomatic? Panic attack?"
Pain persisted after he got Lorazepam and morphine. Whose locker is that?,"Mine. Chest, stomach, throat. What does it all mean?"
We're in the nurses' locker room!,"I know that. Oh, that is so annoying! Wilson's girlfriend's left her stuff in my locker again."
"Great, I hadn't committed any felonies yet today.","Relax, you know they're going to blame!"
"House, you wanna mess with Wilson, no pRoblem. But you've got no reason to screw around with ""ï¿½",Can we get back to the medicine?
"Okay. Why assume one disease? His chest, her throat.","So it's just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains. Wow, they really are a great couple. So much in common. One blue shoe ""ï¿½ what do you think that means?"
It means you're insane! Wilson's not dating her.,You feeling luckier?
It doesn't matter what I answer?,Two hundred it is.
"If they're married and caught the same disease, then it means they ""ï¿½",Aha! Brochure to a jazz festival in the Poconos this weekend.
"Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the Man.","Four, five, six novels, no music. What does that mean?"
She's literate.,"It means she spends her time reading, not listening. She'd only want to go and watch jazz if the only person wanted to go. She has a martyr complex. Issues of inferiority."
"Married couple. Same disease. They either got it from each other, or in the same place.","Infectious or environmental. All you have to do is check out parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, or it's internet porn related. I'll check the internet, you guys cover the rest of the stuff."
Good. Then I'm sure you'll have no pRoblem convincing House.,That cheating bastard!
He loves her!,"Right, I bet he told you that she's the love of his life."
"People lie, I get it, but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless ""ï¿½",There's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines. They're idiots! 20-year-olds fall in and out of love more often than they change their oil filters. Which they should do more often.
"Gonorrhea explains all their symptoms. Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome for her belly pain, Costochondritis and bladder infection for his chest and abdominal pain.","Good. Now go rub their lying, cheating privates with a cotton swab."
"No scarring, no purulent discharge, and the NATs were negative. They don't have an STD.","What's that, you say? You have a pRoblem with interracial couples?"
"Thank you, Chase.",No! Haven't any of your shorties Ever been whities?
"Not sure I understand your ghetto slang, Dr. House. How Many black women have you dated, by the way?",I don't care about color. As long as they can help me breed a superior race.
"Yeah, my exes have usually been black, so what? It's not a racial thing, it's cultural. I have more in common with them, like I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.","Sorry, you're right. That kind of prejudice is totally fine."
The abdominal pain's getting worse. We've had to up their morphine twice.,"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental."
"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental.",He got off easy. I almost gave him a colonoscopy.
"That was one of the stupidest things you have Ever done, and there is heavy competition for ""ï¿½ What are you doing?","Hmm, only ate half your breakfast. Feeling a little sick this morning?"
"I'm not pregnant, they burnt my omelet. You need to apologize to this guy.",I'm a Man of principle. I don't care how much time and money it costs you to defend me.
He wants to kill you.,No empty coffee cups. Off the caffeine. Good for baby.
"Cup's in the other wastebasket, baby's in your mind! You can berate Patients all you want. Shoving objects into their rectums is assault. Pay attention to me.","Sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you. Can't ignore that rapidly expanding first trimester ass, though."
Or tumors or anything.,"You add brain involvement to the chest, stomach, throat, what've you got?"
"Didn't spike a fEver when we took her off the steroids, so it's not an infection.",Leaving environmental. What flavor?
"Environmental doesn't make sense, either. If it were toxin, we'd see it in their livers. None of their neighbors are sick, no coworkers ""ï¿½","They both got it, meaning it's infection or environmental, and since it's not an infection!"
What if they didn't both get it? Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong and it's two different diseases?,Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.,Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.
I did see these two putting out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.,"If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes, it has environmental causes. We just don't know all of them yet. Husband's chest. He has slightly enlarged hylar lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis explains almost all of their symptoms, including her getting worse off the steroids."
It doesn't explain his throat swelling.,That's what 'almost' means.
90% of sarcoidosis cases have lung scarring.,"Oh, 90%?"
"Oh, almost.","Fine, I'll consult a specialist."
If this is more dating advice!,"Love to gossip, but I've got work to do. Is this sarcoidosis?"
"It's pretty nonspecific. Could be granulomas, could be plaques. What's this? Oh, oh, you stole Wendy's personnel file?!","In a way, aren't we all guilty of bribing the janitor of taking the file and giving it to me? Yes, I take my share of the blame, but society's also ""ï¿½"
"First of all, I am not dating her.","She is so wrong for you. You know, she filed a form so the hospital would take extra withholding. Who does that?"
"She's much too cautious for me. Point taken, I'll start dating her so I can break up with her and start dating a stripper. You're a miserable jerk who can't stand to be alone.",I didn't try to break up your marriages; you did that yourself.
My marriages were so crappy I was spending all my time with you. Your real fear is me having a good relationship.,"Yes, that keeps me up at night. That and the Loch Ness monster, global warming, evolution, and other fictional concepts. Although a big, roMantic weekend in the Poconos could change Everything."
You don't! no. I don't think it's sarcoidosis.,He says it's sarcoidosis. Start them both on methotrexate.
And if you're wrong?,If Wilson's wrong. We'll biopsy her just to be sure.
"The brain stem? Brain damage is not only possible, it's likely!","Good point. Let's biopsy something safer, like her shoes."
"The husband, he'd have to give consent. He can't right now.",Why? This guy write with his stomach?
"He has a conflict of interest. It's not his brain we're cutting open, but he's getting all the benefit. He'd do it just to save himself.","Or to save her. She's the love of his life, remember?"
She needs a guardian ad litem. I can't let you do this.,How're you going to stop me? Call Cuddy?
"Cameron's right, there's a conflict.","No, there isn't! Not unless one of them wants to die a horrible, painful death."
I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.,In a couple days! Will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain until we can get the legalities worked out?
"I just don't want some plaintiff's Lawyer owning my hospital. Legalities help. Speaking of which, did you get your thermometer back yet?","Uh, we had a nice chat. Did you know he's a Rotarian? Listen, she'll die without the biopsy."
"I need to cover the hospital's ass. You're too biased. I send you in there, you'll steamroll over him. Something goes wrong, he'll sue us for not disclosing the risks.","Then have Wilson talk to the husband. Wilson kills people left and right, no one Ever sues him."
"Fine, but only if you apologize to the clinic guy.","Nah, pRobably better to just let that couple die."
Then stop treating me.,Great job. Why don't you just shoot him in the head?
"Hold on, that gives me an idea. You know what could save this couple, lots of misdirected sarcasm.",They're dead. Yelling at you might prEvent you from screwing up like this --
I didn't screw up. I did my job!,Your job was to get me the biopsy.
"No, it was to present the Patient with his options.","Two options: biopsy or no biopsy. He chose the third, no treatment. How do you Even do that?"
Remember when you used to just weave elaborate conspiracy theories about my love life? Those were such good times.,How much morphine is the husband on?
"We can't increase it any more, his respirations are depressed.","Decrease it! Drugs cloud people's Judgement. Cold turkey, you sucker."
"Uh, no.",Good point.
Good point.,Did I ask you guys to follow me?
"No, which made us nervous.",They'll catch on if they notice that he's off the morphine drip. Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.
No!,You do understand it's not really a puppy.
"An opiate blocker? It'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire. That's pretty unethical, Even for you.",How is that unethical? It'll lead to a diagnosis!
It's leading to the torture of the husband on the off chance he'll allow a procedure on another person!,"Which will lead to a diagnosis, didn't I just say that?"
"Give it up. Foreman and Cameron are too ethical, and I'm too scared of getting sued.","Fine. Now I'm just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won't be tempted to use it."
"You're not doing it, either. What, you're gonna run for it?","If they die now, they'll nEver be able to grow old and tired of each other."
That's actually pretty clEver.,"Guess I can't use that trick again, huh?"
"Oh! Ow, my stomach, ow!","It's a pretty smart plan, Jerry, but I'm on to you. There's only one good reason to kill the biopsy. You poisoned your wife, and don't want the coppers to get wise."
No!,Oh. Then you're just a moron!
Biopsy me!,"Only if this thing hits your brain, you moron! I can't stress that moron thing enough. You're killing your wife!"
She is the love of my life!,"Careful. Once you say that and you're on wife #2, you're gonna feel real guilty about saying that. Feel that? Get used to it, the pain's gonna get a lot worse."
"No, it won't. The morphine just isn't working right now for some reason. I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the mean time. It'll work again soon.",Wanna bet?
"I don't care about the pain. I need to be in pain, so I can get worse. That means you can do the biopsy on me!","Dude, she's in a coma. Who're you trying to impress?"
I was just going to call you.,I need a court order to biopsy this Woman's brain.
I don't want to sue you.,Good.
I want to beat the crap out of you.,Less good.
"I'll tell you why. You're a bully. And bullies, they don't back down until they run into someone stronger and meaner.",But you'll accept an apology.
Yes.,Not really a recipe for sincerity.
I'm not looking for sincerity. I'm looking for humiliation. Something that will make you think twice before you treat the next Patient like crap.,"Here's what's gonna happen: you go brag to your friends about how you made the big, nasty doctor go poop in his pants, I get Cuddy off my back by telling her I humiliated myself, here's the catch ""ï¿½ we're both gonna be lying. I'm not apologizing. If anything, you deserved a bigger thermometer. What's wrong?"
Jeremy's worse.,Then that's what's right. You cut the stubborn jerk's head open and take a slice.
This isn't sarcoidosis.,"He'll get his wish. He's dying, just not in a way that's going to help his wife."
He's got ischemic bowel.,So what?
"Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's causing his guts to die, which will cause him to die unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine and reattach the ends. I don't know, seems like a match.",Why does he have it? What does it tell us?
Small cell vasculitis?,"Good. Now, let's hear it again, but now with a more environmental or infectious feeling."
"Or, like I said before, it might not be environmental or infectious. He has vasculitis, she has porphyria. Belly pain plus hallucinations, classic symptoms. Can Even cause a coma.",Fine. Start her on hematin for porphyria.
What about him?,"Take out the dead bowel, it's all we can do. And biopsy it. If Foreman's right, it might save him. If Foreman's wrong, it might save both of them."
The bowel's not dead.,"Unless he's been tossing down cans of frosty lactic acid, the bowel is dead. What we're looking for is a reason it's dead."
The bowel's not dead. Just general swelling and edema. The high lactate was pRobably from stress. We just sliced him open from chest to pubic bone for nothing.,Nothing's something. Forget the isochemia. Add the edema and swelling.
PRobably from cutting him open.,"PRobably, not definitely. Okay, back to the beginning. What did we talk about? Anything, I want to hear it all again."
He wasn't cheating on her.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Love of his life. Don't you have to wait 'till he's dead to make that determination?"
"She's his only girlfriend Ever. They grew up next door. They ran off together as teenagers. Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out because we thought he had isochemic ""ï¿½",Why did they run off?
"What difference does it ""ï¿½","Kids talk about running off, not Many do it. What was the reason?"
"They were trying to escape his evil, pill-popping, racist dad. You would have liked him. We should do another biopsy.",How'd you know the dad was racist?
"He beat up his son for dating a black girl. Extrapolated from that ""ï¿½",You see racism Everywhere. Maybe he just didn't like this black girl.
"It's not sarcoid. We would have seen granulomas in ""ï¿½","She has pretty eyes. Forget infectious. Forget environmental. Defective DNA is keeping them from making a critical protein, hence the fluid build-up. Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain."
Angioedema?,Hereditary Angioedema. Symptoms fit perfectly.
"It's an incredibly rare disease. They would both have to have a parent ""ï¿½","Is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair, or that these two have green eyes?"
You're not saying! they're not brother and sister?,"Ew, God, no! That would be sick. Half-brother and sister. Different moms. Dad must have had an affair with her mom. That's why he flipped out when the kids started dating, he had it himself, pRobably why the pills."
"You won't know for sure ""ï¿½",Test them for HAE or paternity. It's going to take a day. She doesn't have a day. Start treating and see what happens.
"Tracy, Tracy, she's awake. Oh God, baby, it's going to be okay.","Awesome, can I tell them?"
"We've obviously got to let them know what's wrong, but the cause, the brother-sister thing!","Good plan. You've just got to keep them away from doctors, the internet, and anyone who's not a total moron."
"Yesterday he was willing to die to save her. You've got to give him time to recover ""ï¿½",He might be a little vexed that you kept letting him hump his sister in the mean time.
"Unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union, the chances of serious complications are minimal.","Noble of you to take that risk. Tell them, or I will."
I'm going out of town.,"Where are you going? Foreman, you're not missing a blue shoe, are you? Comï¿½ you can't bet when you know the answer beforehand!"
We can spend all day arguing whether you can bet when you know the answer beforehand. Give me the two hundred bucks.,What?
She just needs some time alone. You want me to hang out here a bit?,"If you've come to return the thermometer, don't bother. I've moved on."
"If you'd actually read my chart, you'd know that I'm a cop. You were going 40 in a 25 zone.","Oh, come on. This isn't because I was speeding, it's because I'm Latino."
"License, registration, proof of insurance.","Sorry, cool jacket. Only pockets for important stuff."
That's a shame.,"50 buck ticket. Is that your way of beating me up, or is that the price for sticking something in you?"
"You took a pill while examining a Patient, that's serious addictive behavior. I'm betting that you're holding right now.","I wasn't weaving, I'm not drunk, you've got no reason to ""ï¿½"
"Pupils dilated, appear to be under the influence of a narcotic. Would you mind turning around, please, and putting your hands behind your head?",Does that polite crap Ever work on people?
Most people realize that there's only one answer. Got a prescription?,I'm a cripple who works in a hospital. You don't think I've got a valid prescription?
"Have my baby, what a lovely way to say how much you love me...",Excusez-moi garÃ§on! Hello?! It's 11 o' clock. Which means my friend is ready for his sponge bath and I shouldn't be here. Hey! Gomer Pyle! I know you can hear me!
I think you mean Barney Fife.,So Many great idiot icons to choose from.
You need time to think of some more?,Either arraign me or let me go.
"No pRoblem, which do you prefer?",What took you so long?
"Sorry, I didn't have 15 grand in my loose change jar. What the hell did you do?",Nothing.
"The motorcycle was impounded, that explains the speeding, DUI and driving without a license. The fact that you're you explains the illegal possession of narcotics and resisting arrest.",Where's your car?
What happened?!,"Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously thought that I didn't treat him with the deference due to a Man of his stature. Trumped up a traffic stop, next thing I know I'm sharing a cage with a guy who thinks that showers are the way the devil gets inside you."
Does Cuddy know?,I don't think she needs to. I'm innocent!
Til proven guilty.,"The guy wanted to punish me, he did it. It's over."
Better get yourself a Lawyer.,I already got one.
You know what they say about the Lawyer who has himself as a client?,"Same thing they say about the doctor who lends 15 grand to a friend he knows can't pay him back. Relax, you'll get it. Where am I going to take off to? Does Salma Hayek live in Mexico or Spain?"
"But I have seen how Many pills he's been popping lately, I wouldn't be surprised if he's in a coma somewhere himself.","If I am, this is one lame hallucination."
What happened to you?,"If you Ever end up in a bar with a Cambridge Woman's heavyweight eight, do not accept the offer of an upside-down kamikaze shot."
We have a case.,"Fat guy in a coma, I know."
Cuddy found you?,"Nope, but the wall between Wilson's office and this one is thinner than you think; which means we need to stop talking about what a pathetic loser he is. Start treating Jabba for Pickwickian Syndrome. His 96 double Zs are pRobably putting pressure on his chest suffocating him."
CO2 and oxygen stats are normal.,"For you and me, what's normal for a hippopotamus? Get a detailed medical history."
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600 pounds bothers with annual physicals.,"Talk to the neighbors, search the House. Let's see what else Shamu's been up to besides eating. This conversation is over because I have officially run out of clEver things to call the guy."
"It's usually worse in the morning. Especially if I've slept on my arm. If I sleep on my back or you know, with my arms out, I'm usually ok.",So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.
Yeah.,"Hmm. Well have you thought about, I don't know, not doing that?"
"Yeah, but it's how I sleep. It's how I've always slept.",Well there's always surgery.
To do what? Like clean out some cartilage or something?,You're not sleeping on some cartilage; you're sleeping on your arm.
You wanna remove my arm?,"Well it is your left, a guy's gotta sleep."
I see spending a night in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.,"While following my Every move is flattering, a single rose on my doorstep each morning would be more enticing."
Just bringing your boss up to speed which I guess you didn't feel was necessary.,You going to add that to my list of charges?
People who are innocent tend not to try to hide their arrest.,"Is that based on your years of experience arresting innocent people? The way you're going at that gum, it's obviously not having the desired effect. You're the addict; you're going to be back at the butts in a month. You're just taking out your frustration on me because my meds actually work. Why don't you quit while you're ahead before you end up as a security guard working the night shift at some strip mall?"
Who's that?,Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm donor search to include Neanderthals.
Cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?,"It's a joke. Like Cuddy would Ever want a kid. Or a kid would Ever want Cuddy. Hello, that's why it's funny! Why are you guys here?"
It's not Pickwick's. Intubation and steroids have had no effect. Except maybe to cause whatEver it is to get worse; he's got a fEver now.,What'd you find out?
That you and George have the same taste in home furnishings and women.,Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?
"Pianos and prostitutes. We should do an LP, look for neurosyphilis.",It's not syphilis.
How do you know?,"Because you get STDs from people you trust. People you don't feel you need to protect yourself from. WhatEver he has is connected to his gut, not what's below it. MRI his brain; look for clots."
Weight limit on the MRI maParkne is 450 pounds.,So do a CT.
Limit's 350.,Then just start treatment.
We give him blood thinners and the coma's caused by a bleed instead of a clot we'd kill him.,"Either start treatment or start building a stronger MRI. WhatEver you do, do it fast. The longer he stays in the coma, the less likely it is he'll Ever wake up."
Here.,What's this?
I made some calls for you. The guy's the best criminal attorney in Princeton.,Thanks but I don't need it. I assume you told Inspector Clouseau that I have a valid prescription for the vicodin?
"Yeah, and I assume you did as well; did it make a difference? The guy's pissed, and with the DEA now treating pain doctors like Columbian--","I'm not a pain doctor, I'm a pain Patient."
"It was pRobably just some sort of head trauma and we missed the swelling because, well, his head's already swollen.",Bump on the noggin doesn't explain the fEver.
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.,Referring to the fund-raising funbags by the royal 'We' now?
Let me explain cause and effect to you.,I specifically told them to skip the boring testing part and jump right to the dangerous treatment.
He's telling the truth.,Kids these days - got no respect for other people's property.
Yeah.,Looks like Cameron is going to be having a lot more ideas in future. Who knew that being bloated and bitchy could actually come in handy?
"We should do nothing. Just keep him a couple of days for observation, if he doesn't get any worse it was pRobably just a hematoma that dissipated on its own.",Or we do all of the above. You check his belly for patches. You check underneath for sores. And you just sit on your ass.
"And now that you have, when can I go?","It's pRobably her mom, I bet she's huge. She's from the Midwest. Since when did you eat beets?"
"Since I was 5? And who are we talking about? You know, just in case you need me to Parkme in and tell you you're a lunatic at some point.","Cameron. She's lying, destroying hospital equipment, telling Cuddy off, gotta find out where she got the Fat Scratch fEver."
Yeah you definitely better get to the bottom of that. I heard Cuddy gave you the name of a Lawyer.,"Or it could just be pity, she feels guilty about being born beautiful so she overcompensates by being nice to ugly people. Would explain why she gets along so well with you."
"From what I hear the Patient reminds her of you, not me. Call the Lawyer.",Cameron sees a clump of dirt and she thinks of me.
Very mature.,You started it.
"Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test were both normal. He has nystagmus, but it's congenital; no way it's related to the coma.","You say no way I say! yeah, no way."
"Blood and urine were negative for ChlAmydia, Herpes and Syphilis.",Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.
"Not for long, he wants to be discharged.","Oh sure. Places to go, people to eat."
He insisted chance of dying from hospital acquired infection is greater than him dying from whatEver caused his coma.,Did you tell him that statistics also say he's a big fat idiot?
Selectively rational? Stubborn? Uncooperative? Maybe you ought to check his leg.,"You see what he did there? The Patient's like me, the Patient's three me's. If I were him-- Maybe it's not such a mystery after all."
"You see what he did there? The Patient's like me, the Patient's three me's. If I were him-- Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.",Enjoying your Salisbury steak?
Putting chopped parsley on a hamburger does not a Salisbury steak make. You must be doctor House.,And you must be full of baloney. A lot of it.
"Right, fat joke, always fun. Only people you can still make fun of.",And Christians. Oh and black people. No one in their right mind comes out of a coma and immediately asks to go home with an unknown condition which means that either you're not in your right mind or it's not an unknown condition. So what is it? You tried to off yourself?
"You figure, I'm fat therefore I hate myself.",That's a huge leap of logic.
I don't wanna die; I just don't wanna be here.,"Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed or it's something you know you've inherited. Let's see your stomach has the deep-seated feelings of abandonment written all over it which points towards sexual abuse. Well a fear of hospitals; that points to a more specific traumatic Event so I'm going to say-- your mom, in the hospital with a candlestick. And by candlestick of course, I mean inherited OTC deficiency."
My parents are both alive and well and living in Boca Raton.,Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?
I have no idea what that is.,Leukoencephalopathy?
"Will you stop? If I knew what was wrong, I would tell you. I'm not an imbecile, and I'm not miserable. I'm just overweight.",What? When? To be continued.
What? When? To be continued.,What are you doing here?
"When you err! when you got bailed out, before we could get a Judge to approve this I almost didn't bother. I thought for sure you'd come straight home and throw Everything out. Rookie mistake; nEver underestimate the stupidity of an addict. There's got to be over 600 vicodin in here which most DA's would say proves intent to traffic. Even if all you'd really intended was simply to be wasted 24/7 while practicing medicine.","In case you hadn't noticed, those are prescription bottles. Now I'm not an expert on linguistics per se but I think that means they were prescribed."
All these were legally prescribed to a Man who's in constant pain but nEver misses a day at work?,Ever occurred to you that's why I don't miss a day?
"Now maybe just a few of these are in someone else's name. Forged prescription. Just swiped from the pharmacy when nobody's looking. You wouldn't do that, right?",Send him home.
"Why, you think he's healthy?","Either I'm right and he knows what's wrong, he's just too stubborn to admit it or I was right and it's Pickwick's. Treatment just had a delayed effect."
You don't have delayed effects to oxygen. And Pickwick's doesn't explain the fEver.,Being engulfed in an electric blanket of blubber could explain the fEver.
"Yesterday you insisted on keeping him here because of the fEver, we have no idea what's wrong with the guy. For all we know he could be dead in 12 hours.","He does not want our help, which means he doesn't want your help."
He's obviously just rationalizing and so are you! You would nEver give up this easy if you weren't so busy dealing with your own personal pRoblems.,Send him home. What'd you tell that cop?
Nothing.,Nothing as in nothing; or as in nothing to cause him to think that I have a stash in my apartment?
"He called to see if I prescribed the pills, I said yes, that's all.",Obviously not.
What happened?,"He searched my House, found a butt load of pills. A guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day."
Last I checked pharmacies are still open when it rained.,And because I nEver know when you're going to be in one of your moods and cut me off.
"Oh, it's my fault.",I'm not the one who talked to the cop.
Disorientation and loss of balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.,Where's Chase?
Dunno. Haven't seen him since you told him to sit on his ass yesterday.,Interesting. NF-2 is also inherited which means I was right.
Kept saying it was Pickwick's.,"Between the first Pickwick's and the second Pickwick's, I said it was inherited."
"No, he's not.",We have a rather large piece of tempered glass that begs to differ.
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair but he's tough to stop.,"Nice audible, Peyton."
So what do we do now?,"Discharge report says he didn't eat his breakfast. Humpty Dumpty didn't get to be the size of all the King's horses by skipping the most important meal of the day. What causes coma, fEver and a loss of appetite?"
It can't be Chagas'; he's nEver been outside the country.,"But his stomach has, the food we eat no longer comes from America's heartland, it comes from South America's deforested jungle land where lettuce now grows and lettuce pickers now poop. Get a sample of his CSF before the little bugs that are now feasting on his brain move on to dessert."
How are we going to do that? He's too big to do an LP.,So go straight to the source.
And not surprisingly there was no sign of Chagas or any other parasites in his CSF.,"So we've ruled out his parents, prostitutes, the arugula - means either--"
"I took the sample from the pre-frontal, I was nEver anywhere near his visual cortex.",Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.
"Not a chance, the MRI was clean.",Mind?
Where are you going?,To get a 400 dollar butt plug.
What about George?,He's going to have to get his own. Come on; let's see if we can get this thing figured out by the time we get to the elevator.
It could also explain his lack of concern for his health. MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.,"Yeah, he's a delight. You don't get to MS with coma as the first symptom, blindness plus coma says diabetes. Just in time."
"No, blood sugar and urine dipstick and hemoglobin A1C are normal.","Were normal when you tested it. He's been in and out of a coma, whatEver's going on is waxing and waning, unlike his pant size which only waxes. Which also points to diabetes. Test him again, this time add a glucose tolerance test and a HEC."
We already have a CSF sample; we might as well check it for proteins and rule out MS first.,Agreed; except for the part about doing it first.
Where are you going?,The butt plug was my way of saying mind your own business; apparently too subtle.
"Speeding. DUI. Reckless driving, resisting arrest, possession of a class 3 narcotic and now it looks like they've added another possession with intent to traffic charge as well. They found some pills at your House.",All of which I had a prescription for.
That's a lot of pills.,"I'm in a lot of pain. This is all because some cop came into the clinic, I was rude to him. This is his way of getting back at me."
You've made it pretty easy.,"His insane reaction to a simple rectal thermometer reading, pRobably says a lot more about his mother than it says about me."
I'm inclined to think your particular charm may not be immediately appreciated by a jury.,I'm not interested in a plea bargain.
It's your best bet to make this go away.,"There is no ""this"", there's a him; the only thing I'm guilty of is humiliating a bully. I wasn't speeding, I wasn't impaired, I didn't resist and I certainly wasn't distributing narcotics to anyone but myself because I need those narcotics."
"What did your Lawyer say? I looked up butt plug in a legal dictionary, what'd he say?",That a smile like mine can't lose. What did the test say?
"You're right about MS, no myelin basic proteins in his CSF.",What about diabetes?
"Don't know, says we think only think it's diabetes because of his weight, won't let us test him.","So, you would rather be a blind invalid than admit the fact that maybe you might have a little pRoblem with overeating? And by a little pRoblem of course, I mean you've eaten yourself half to death."
And you would rather let me die than consider the fact that whatEver is wrong with me has nothing to do with my weight.,I go where the symptoms tell me to go. Right now they're asking why this stuff is the first thing you've Ever refused to swallow.
I am not diabetic!,"Grocery stores giving away medical degrees with the free turkeys now? The sooner you drink this, the sooner I get to go waste my time with something else."
Get the hell off of me!,No dessert 'til you've finished your dinner.
What the hell is going on?,Just trying to force a horse to--
What's going on?,"Get x-rays of his hands, then bronc him do a sputum cytology and check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies."
How are we going to get him to do all that when we can't Even get him to drink a bottle of sugar water?,Tell him that lung cancer is in no way connected to obesity.
Err... you don't think he'll realize we're lying?,We're not; lung cancer's got nothing to do with--
I meant about him having lung cancer.,You didn't notice his fingers?
I noticed they were fat?,"Should have pissed him off. He would have grabbed you and you would have felt the bones, they're not just fat, they're clubbed."
You were right.,So was he.
"He said, c'est la vie.",He's a compliCated Man.
What about you? What are you going to do about your pRoblem?,"Nothing. I just got a call from my Lawyer, he gave the DA copies of my prescriptions. As soon as they confirm that it's bona fide, they're going to drop the possession, DUI and resisting arrest. As soon as I pay my 85 dollars speeding ticket and impound fine, I get my bike back."
I guess that's good.,You guess?
"No, it's good. You get to keep going like you always have.","Alright, I give up, who was it? Who in your family had the weight pRoblem?"
You think I can only care about a Patient if I know someone else who's been through the same thing?,You care for Everybody. You only lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.
You lie for Everybody and only care about a few.,You're avoiding the question.
"I like damaged people, remember? Explains Everything I do.","Almost Everything. Wasn't you, was it?"
Does it matter?,"Nope, but it'd be interesting."
What're you doing down here? Thought you usually have lunch with Coma Guy.,"This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company. Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa's you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral."
You stole my prescription pad and you forged my name!,What'd you tell the cop?
I lied! He'd have put you away for ten years; after they took your license to practice medicine.,"So, Everything's good then."
I lied! To the cops!,"There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally. I didn't do the second, you lied about the first. Game over."
"Yeah, Tritter's just playing. He's gonna see how clEver you are and then just walk away.",Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.
What're you doing?,Nothing. What're you doing?
Nothing. What're you doing?,Parkps?
Parkps?,Wanna see something really cool?
Wanna see something really cool?,"I saw you leaving last Tuesday; practically tripped over two guys on your way out. But you had no pRoblem opening doors. It's called Akinetopsia.

He didn't report being an alcoholic either. Drinking equals falling down equals trauma equals...,Maybe it's inherited.
How did you jump to genetics? From his EEG? All you got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.,"It's not his EEG. It's his father's. When it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son."
Small seizures aren't unheard of in a Patient in a vegetative state.,Similarities are interesting though.
What caused the vegetative state?,"His House burned down; went back in to get his wife. Firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated."
Not an inherited condition.,Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.
Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.,Check out the home.
MRI and LP are both inconclusive. Infection's still possible. Tumor's less likely than...,DNA?
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.,DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg and late-onset Lafora's.
Genetic tests take forEver. You can't just keep testing him for Every inherited condition you think it might be.,"Well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can."
He's unconscious and heading for a coma. He's at a four on the RLAS scale.,Stop all treatment.
To see if this is a reaction to our meds?,"Well, they obviously aren't helping. Given the fact that he's an alcoholic, there's a good chance his liver wasn't so hot when he came in. Anti-seizure drugs, they just pushed him over the edge."
"We take him off those meds, what do we put him on?",I was hoping you'd know.
Or neurological or...,Genetic.
Genetic.,We need a better history.
You're not waking Kyle. You're waking his father.,I commend your observational skills.
You have no reason to think any Manner of drugs will wake a Man from a coma.,"Vegetative state. Much easier. This guy's no Terri SParkavo, his brain's all there, he moves around, muscles have barely atrophied, just waiting for a fairy-tale kiss. After I do that, stick a needle in him."
The amount of amphetamines alone will be dangerous. Besides whatEver the hell else you got in there.,There are reports out of South Africa about a pill that'd temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state. We've all seen Awakenings. It made me cry. I wanna cry.
Put the syringe down.,"I can out draw you, mysterious stranger."
We don't experiment on helpless Patients!,Be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.
"Even if you woke him, it would only be for a few hours! A day! Two at the most! You're risking his life!",I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.
You'll be torturing him and his family.,Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.
Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.,Whooaaaaaii!
"I had a paramedic ask me something similar after getting knocked out during a sporting Event, my response was ""numbers""ï¿½.]",Coolest thing Ever. Any history of seizure in your family?
No.,Liver disease?
"No. How long have I been here? Got the feeling it's uh, been a long time.","Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?"
"Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?",Or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?
Sorry.,How 'bout your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?
Ahh! Rumor in the cafeteria was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.,"Technically, Vegetative State Guy was woken by... yeah, Caustic Guy."
"So, what happened?","Gotta get him a steak, before I can ask him anymore questions."
He doesn't wanna talk about his son?,Didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated. Spent ten years as asparagus. Who knows what damage is in there?,It's possible. 'Course always the simple explanation. Maybe he just doesn't like his son.
Only in your world would that be simple.,The delusion that fathering a Parkld installs a perManent geyser of unconditional love--
"Maybe your father's feelings were conditional, not Everyone's--","Yes. Well, of course. That would play into your roMantic vision of huMan..."
"Terms you would understand. We have an evolutionary incentive to sacrifice for our offspring, our tribe, our friends. Keep them safe.",Except for all the people who don't. Everything is conditional. You just can't always anticipate the conditions.

"""Coma diet"". I could make a fortune.","""Vegetative State Diet"". Who gave you your clothes?"
Dr. Cuddy. I guess I'll need all new ones anyway. Everything went in the fire.,"Don't worry about it. We use recyclable clothes now. Wear them once, then eat them. Your son's measles vaccination, d'you remember if he had it and what type it was?"
"You weren't gonna tell me, were ya? I don't need new clothes. Dr. Cuddy says my body will adjust to the drugs, and I'll be a vegetable again by tomorrow; if I'm really lucky, the day after.",Yeah.
"If I got a day to live, I'm not gonna spend it in the hospital room, being grilled.","C'mon, where you gonna go? House burned down, your wife's dead. Business is sold off. The only thing you have left is down the hall, heading for a liver biopsy."
"Used to be this little um, hole in the wall, run by a guy named Giancarlo. Made the best hoagies in the world. Real Italian rolls. Prosciutto, provolone, Mmm. How far is Atlantic City from here?",You have one day to live and you want a sandwich.
People on death row get a last meal.,State provides it. Who's providing for you? You got a car? Money?
You're negotiating with me.,"Take out another hundred, for me. And I need your car."
I'm not doing you any favors.,You'll get it back tomorrow. Two days max. Road trip.
"Oh, the hell he does!",Sure!
"Aside from the fact, he just woke up from a vegetative state; the guy doesn't have a license.","How 'bout this? Cops stop us, we lie. You know how to do that. Parkps!"

What was wrong with the old colors? I trusted brown. Do the purple ones have chocolate inside?,Raspberry cocaine. This House that burned down. Where was it?
"Morristown, New Jersey. Listen, I really need to know about the candy, because I'm allergic to berries.",You didn't mention that.
Is it significant?,"No. So, where else did you live? List Everywhere, including vacations. Start with when your wife got pregnant."
"We lived in Jersey. Then we moved to Jersey; from there, Jersey. What, are you waiting to hear about the little cottage in the Amazon, with the mosquitoes and the lead paint all over the walls?",Yes.
You know what? I didn't let you come along so you could suck all the fun out of my one day of life.,"Well, you're out of luck, 'cause that's totally why I'm here."
Okay. Rule change.,"Person with the money makes the rules. Or in this case, person who's friend's the person with the money, makes the rules."

I'm curious.,"No, you're not."
Why would a Man's first instinct to be to drive away from the only family he's got?,"Noooo! This is no time for you to do your thing! We don't care about his state of mind, we don't care if he's happy. This factory of yours. What did you make?"
"Noooo! This is no time for you to do your thing! We don't care about his state of mind, we don't care if he's happy. This factory of yours. What did you make?",So ask me a question.
I'm thinking.,"Only six left, by the way."
What is up with you two?,Wilson lied to the bulls to keep me out of the big House.
Are you out of your mind?,"Who's he gonna tell? By tomorrow night, he's gonna be a mindless stalk of celery. Since I answered that one, by the way, my turn. What did you make in your factory?"
Luxury boats. You Ever been in love?,Wow! Going right for the closets with the embarrassing stuff. Good move. Yes! Describe the boats.

You're thinking trauma?,I'm thinking drugs. He's an admitted user. Drugs crashed his immune system.
Tox screen was clean.,Clean tox screen means there's no drugs in his blood or urine. There could still be drugs trapped in his fat cells from the good old days.

"You wanna think that he's sacrificing himself because if one person could do it, then maybe the world isn't a cold, selfish place you know that it is.",Radiation could kill him. Alternatives?
There aren't any. We saw the tumours.,We could choose to say they aren't tumours. They're just pus. Which would explain why they weren't there yesterday.

Gallstones?,The Biliary duct is dilated. PRobably from a stone lodged in it. Musta caused a nasty case of pancreatitis.
She's six. Six-year-olds don't get gallstones.,So... she didn't have pancreatitis?
"You might wanna wait until he actually tells us his theory, before you start kissing his theory's ass.",My theory is... vanishing gallstone.
My theory is... vanishing gallstone.,"She had it and it passed. Those things travel in packs. Most of them pRobably hiding out in her gallbladder. Do an ultrasound. If I'm right, take out the organ, so we can analyse the stones."
"The whole point of the criminal justice system... is to make things right, when Everything else fails. With all due respect, you have failed.","Sorry, didn't know you wanted your kid dead. Although for a couple of G's, I can still make it happen."
Who the hell are you?,"I am a complete stranger, who apparently cares more about whether your kid dies than you do."
You're Dr. House.,You've seen my stage show.
"Then I'll take her to our paediatrician. She's six, Rob. She shouldn't have unnecessary surgery.",Or a moron for a mom. What can you do?
I've read the file. You've got fifteen minutes.,'S people like this who killed Copernicus.
Galileo.,Either way.
And they just locked Galileo up.,They killed his spirit. And nobody likes a showoff.
They killed his spirit. And nobody likes a showoff.,"Luckily, Alice HartMan has a dad, who's willing to see reason."
Reason is defined by slavishly deferring to you.,Their doctor.
"Your Honour, I've had no opportunity to consult my attorney.",There's no time.
All I want is a second opinion before...,No time!
Your testimony is their Parkld will die if I don't grant this motion right now.,Am I under oath?
Let's say yes.,My testimony is that this Parkld might die if you don't grant this motion right now.
Literally no time for a second opinion.,Won't be as good as the first opinion.
"Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?",She's not a specialist in this area. Her opinion is worthless.
I already gave you that number.,Simple surgical procedure turns a little girl into the English Patient. What gives?
Cameron. C-A-M-E-R-O-N.,"This is my office, I'm talking, there are people here who work for me, but not listening. Explain this to me."
Tritter froze my account. They're checking theirs. I'm on hold with the Lawyer.,Call Wilson's Lawyer. He'll tell you exactly how and why you're screwed. This kid has no history of allergies.
"Yeah, great plan! The Man's obviously open to reason.","Here's the plan - we do nothing. We while away the time, diagnosing the Patient. Stones were calcium, bilirubin and pigment stones."
Which are non-conclusive.,"Kid presented with low-grade fEver, mild anaemia. That plus the stones indiCates bacterial infection."
"Bacterial infections don't cause a vesicular rash. And doing nothing is not a plan, it's specifically a lack of a plan!","We cut into her belly, bad boys escape. They swarm over, colonize the wounds and- Kaplow!- vesicular rash."
"He hasn't gotten to mine yet. I'm gonna withdraw as much as I can, as fast as I can. Lunch is on me.","Do a scratch test, check for allergies. When it comes back negative, start broad-spectrum antibiotics."
"Do a scratch test, check for allergies. When it comes back negative, start broad-spectrum antibiotics.","Bullies bully. They don't get a reaction, they lose interest. Now go do what I ask, before I stick your heads into toilets."
Almost done here.,What're you doing here?
I work here.,You passively-aggressively gave up your practice.
I've clinic hours.,"Now you're passively-aggressively spreading peanut butter. Big sign around your neck saying ""Wilson does not have enough cash for the cafeteria""."
"You know, before Lenny Bruce died of the drug overdose...","Oyyyyeeesh. You're gonna confront me with Everyone who's Ever used narcotics. Damn, I have to get something to read."
He became obsessed with his own legal pRoblems and his act turned into long humourless rants about fascist cops and the violation of his rights.,"I get it, I get it, I need to change my nightclub act. Need more props."
How could she be allergic to Everything?,She can't be. Has to be an infection.
You see positive allergy tests and decide it's an infection?,Bacteria got into the scratches in her back.
Infections radiate. The shape of this isn't...,Eat this.
I don't feel like eating.,Make you better.
A sandwich?,Magic sandwich.
There's no such thing as...,"Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?"
"Just take a damn bite, okay, kid?",Amazing how she didn't go into anaphylactic shock.
It's diagnostically ridiculous.,Right! She's allergic to Everything except peanuts.
"If she is allergic, antibiotics could cause massive systemic reaction.",If she's allergic. But she's not.
"Chase, you're right. The shape indiCates allergy, the tests indiCate allergy. Just because she's not allergic to peanuts, doesn't mean she's not allergic to Lidocaine or...",Chase! Hang the bag! And grow a backbone tomorrow.
"No, I'm not giving my daughter drugs that can shut her system down.",You know what else shuts down systems? Death!
Sorry! I can't let you do this.,"Luckily, Alice HartMan has a mom who is willing to see reason."
"You were in here yesterday, telling me her father's guardianship was best for her.",I honestly figured I'd get a different Judge today.
"Hey, zip it! I've heard enough.",This Lawyering thing is easy.
"No, I was finishing my sentence. The kid's all yours.",Three o'clock! Gimme the pills!
I don't Even know this kid. How am I supposed to decide what's best for her?,Fine! I'll choose. Always side with the angry doctor's opinion. Gimme my pills.
We're not gonna go broad-spectrum. There's any chance that she's allergic...,There is no chance...
Of course there's a chance.,I'm appealing.
"No, you're not. Think of bacterial, pick one antibiotic.",Not gonna be enough. Need to go broad-spectrum...
"Help her, please!","On the plus side, she could medal at luge."
Except that her liver's starting to shut down. No dystrophy.,Metronidazole - great idea.
Metronidazole - great idea.,Let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chances at actually curing her.
"House, can you focus on the case?",No! 'Cause I'm in pain! 'Cause you think that compromise's the answer to Everything! I need more pills!
Then what?,I need more pills!!
No! You are on a reasonable...,"What the hell does ""reasonable"" mean?"
Keep it quiet. Her BP reacts to stress. And yelling is not go...,"You think that I'm not in pain. Then don't give me anything. Keep me away from the aspirin. If I'm in a buttload of pain, I need a buttload of pills!"
"I say we draw straws. Loser drives out to Trenton, scores him an eight-ball.",Which one of you two gave her an aspirin?
What?,"Her symptoms fit Reye's Syndrome. Which doesn't make any sense, unless you took aspirin."
I'm not Even angry. I just want her to be okay.,She's lying. She's angry. 'Cause you kidnapped her kid. She'll be angrier if the kid dies.
I didn't.,One aspirin! Combined with the preexisting infections is all it takes to set off an atta...
I'm not lying.,"Well, sure. You certainly earned her trust. Where was Alice the night she came in?"
She's fifteen. She's very responsible.,"She a fifteen-year-old pharmacist? Or is it just some kid from down the street, who needed twenty bucks for lip gloss and couple of Tiger Beats?"
"She a fifteen-year-old pharmacist? Or is it just some kid from down the street, who needed twenty bucks for lip gloss and couple of Tiger Beats?",Put your kid on charcoal hemoperfusion.
Shouldn't we hear what the baby-sitter has to say?,I know what she's gonna say. She's gonna lie to save her business. Gimme more pills.
"Everytime we touch this kid, something goes wrong.",Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.
You really have to flash your private stash in front of me?,You find it easier to lie for me if it's more subtle? Fine!
That's... unlikely. The charcoal would have absorbed a lot of the heparin. She's been anaemic. Could be a primary blood disorder.,or we nEver cured the infection.
"Pain wasn't House's fault. Even if the clot was a reaction to what we gave her, we still have to...","I don't need you to cover my ass! What I need is my Vicodin! Two pills Every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance. She's given the cop lEverage over medical decisions! What the hell, why don't we get a plumber in here, ask his opinion! Hey Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in...!"
"I don't need you to cover my ass! What I need is my Vicodin! Two pills Every six hours. Like I'm on an allowance. She's given the cop lEverage over medical decisions! What the hell, why don't we get a plumber in here, ask his opinion! Hey Cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in...!",Where the hell is she?
Look at her arm.,Told you it was an infection.
We fixed the infection!,"Well, apparently not! I asked you for broad-spectrum, you put her on the bare minimum! It's a good thing you failed to become a mom, 'cause you suck at it!!"
"Well, apparently not! I asked you for broad-spectrum, you put her on the bare minimum! It's a good thing you failed to become a mom, 'cause you suck at it!!",What's good about this rash?
What's good about this rash?,Good guesses! But no.
Good guesses! But no.,It's on parts of her body that we haven't touched. She's got a fEver of a hundred-and-three. She's in and out of consciousness. But it's not a reaction to anything we did. Our mojo is off the table. Which means...?
It's on parts of her body that we haven't touched. She's got a fEver of a hundred-and-three. She's in and out of consciousness. But it's not a reaction to anything we did. Our mojo is off the table. Which means...?,"Oh! So close. Means thanks to Cuddy's candy-ass approach, broad-spectrum antibiotics are no longer an option. This thing has grown horns and fangs. We gotta figure out what species it is. Go in with a spear to the heart."
"Oh! So close. Means thanks to Cuddy's candy-ass approach, broad-spectrum antibiotics are no longer an option. This thing has grown horns and fangs. We gotta figure out what species it is. Go in with a spear to the heart.","Okay, you guys are sulking. I don't really care why, but apparently I can't do my job without finding out."
Tritter released our bank accounts.,"Horrible, horrible news. Wow! I'm glad we didn't let that fester. If she did have Reye's, then it could be varicella or associated..."
He released our money. You do know what that means?,"The correct question is ""How can it be varicella given that she's not itchy?""."
_We_ weren't laughing with him.,Maybe he just gave up. Start the kid on chloramphenicol for Rocky Mountain Spotted FEver.
Can we talk?,Nope.
I really think you need...,"Either you screwed me and you want absolution, or you didn't and you want applause. Either way, not interested."
Chloramphenicol isn't working.,What dose did you give her?
I doubled her up.,"Okay, the infection's morphed. It's moved into her muscle sheath."
That's impervious to drugs.,The only treatment is to cut away the infected area. So we amputate.
Arm and leg? We can't cut a six-year-old kid in half without a confirmed diagnosis.,It moves too quickly and we waited too long. We don't have time for a culture.
"We can at least observe her for few hours, confirm the rash is spreading.","It spreads, she dies."
We're not Even certain this was an infection.,"Right!! She's six! She's cute! She can't have flesh-eating bacteria! It's just wrong! Let's cure her with sunshine and puppies! Cute kids die of terrible illnesses! Innocent doctors go to jail, just because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required! You can sit around and moan about who's the"

Innocent doctors go to jail, just because cowards like you won't stand up and do what's required! You can sit around and moan about who's the",I'm gonna go do my job.
What kind of quality of life will she have without...?,One thing about life - it's got qualities.
Gotta stop the surgery! She doesn't have necrotizing fasciitis!,Oh good.
She's got erythropoietic protoporphyria! She's allergic to light. It's genetic. Either parent could have carried it.,I know what it is. Infection fits better.
She gets worse Everytime she goes under surgical lights! Dad takes her outside...,Liver's shot too. She swallow a flashlight?
Stop the surgery!,Get the hell out of my way.
Merry Christmas.,And a happy go to hell. What is he doing here? Is he with you?
Detective Tritter and I... we worked out a deal.,"Already got a Lawyer, get out of my office."
"I spoke with the DA, he agreed to two months in a rehab facility in exchange for a guilty plea.",Get out of my office.
No jail time.,"Right, so I should get locked up in some place I don't belong in order to avoid getting locked up in some other place I don't belong."
No sanctions to the medical board.,"Um hmm, and you get your car back and your bank accounts and your precious tumour-ridden Patients."
I did this to help you.,"Next Christmas, buy me a sweater."
You punched out an employee; you nearly cut a little girl in half because you were too strung out--,"I was in pain! You need to beliEve that I've got a pRoblem so that your betrayal has the illusion of nobility, but you just selfishly--"
"Knock it off. Look, I don't care why Doctor Wilson is doing this, and right now it makes no difference to you either, you need to deal with the reality of your current situation. You want to stand on principle, you end up in a cell, and you end up nEver practicing medicine again. So you got two choices - your principles, or your life.",Get out of my office.
House! Just give me a minute. You're afraid of the pain.,You're not?
"You can still have pain meds in rehab - tramadol, gabapentin--",Those don't work.
They will once you're weaned off the vicodin.,"Look, there's Jesus, go tell the RoMans."
"Well the stitches are healing nicely, there's no sign of infection.",Woah. Sorry. Just need her for a tiny moment. Small favour. Pills.
"Doctor. Don't worry, I'll be firing him soon. Wait in my office.",Incision looks just big enough for chest tube. Collapsed lung? Someone mistake you for a piÃ±ata?
"Delightful, usually we just get the elf jokes this time of year.","""No"" on trauma. Negative PPD. What flavour dwarfs are you guys?"
My daughter and I both have cartilage hair hypoplasia; think you can make a pun out of that?,"Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive. She's got a bit of a short fuse hasn't she?"
"It's a bleb, wait in my office.","Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion."
"We'll schedule an MRI to make sure, but a certain number of these cases are idiopathic.",Let me translate that into Tolkien for you guys - means Doctor Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.
You think you do?,"Give me her chart, and my pills."
"Give me her chart, and my pills.",Santa needs us. Did you get that looked at?
I'm fine.,"Great. I just admitted a cartilage hair hypoplasia dwarf, 15-yrs-old--"
What are you going to do?,"I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual."
Wilson told us he ratted.,Your choice of verb I take it?
"It's appropriate, he betrayed you. And you should take the deal.","Unexplained lung collapse and anaemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic - Cuddy and ""idiop"" being the relevant parts of that sentence."
Can't be TB since Cuddy already ruled it out.,Then you'd be just as big an idiop as her. Don't you people know your dwarfs?
"There are over 200 varieties of dwarfism, each with different medical complications; you can't expect us to be intimately familiar with all of them.",The sick dwarfs sure expect you to.
Cartilage hair hypoplasia - they have compromised immune systems.,"Gold star for Cameron, for extra credit explain to the special needs section of the class why our Patient's negative TB test is irrelevant."
"A PPD involves planting a fragment of TB under the skin to see if the immune system recognises it, because of her compromised immune system, our Patient could have TB but not recognise it.",The little people love you. Let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.
"I'm 4' 1"". That's 1.5 canes in metric.",You don't look a day over 4 feet. I saw in the file that her dad was normal size.
It's average-sized.,Compared to you I'm sure he was huge. Did he have a fetish or did he just fall in love with your long-legged soul?
"He grew up in the circus, said I reminded him of home. Seems like you're the one with the fetish.",Certainly curious about the logistics. Did you stand on a table?
I'm just trying to be helpful.,She also hates Jews.
"I've dealt with worse. Being different, you get used to people's idiocy. Still beats the hell out of actually being an idiot. What?",Care to go for a spin?
"Gallium scan shows no bright spots of any kind, means it's not TB or any other infection.",There are no bright spots because the whole thing is too bright. Except for the liver.
"Could be lung cancer. Tumour causes structural damage, lung caves in on itself, also explains the anaemia.",Doesn't explain the liver pRoblem though.
"Her lung collapsed, there is no liver pRoblem.",Did you guys look at the liver on this thing?
There's no liver pRoblem.,"Seriously, look at the liver."
There's nothing there.,Why not?
Because there's nothing wrong?,Every organ in the scan is lit up like a hundred watt bulb except for her liver which is hovering around 60 watts. And not one of them good 60 watt-ers but an energy-saving--
You saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off? You just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with Wilson.,Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.
"House, we need to talk.",Not taking the deal. Glad we talked. Ultrasound her liver.
Sit down.,Stand up. Your turn.
"House, you're off the case. Your treatment privileges are suspended until you accept Tritter's deal.",Well I'm obviously not going to take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf so I assume there's more to this threat.
I'm also cutting off your vicodin.,That could work.
I'm taking over as attending. Get an MRI of her lungs.,This is not lung cancer.
We'll find out as soon as we MRI her lungs.,You're going to come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging you for pills.
Where's Cuddy?,"In this drawer, it's a rescue mission. I got it under control, you can leave."
"You were right about the liver failure, Patient had variceal bleeding which suggested cirrhosis.",I'm off the clock.
"You predicted this, you obviously saw something.",Obviously.
"Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis but it shows sclerosing cholangitis. Even weirder, there's no increase in alkaline phosphotates.",Hmm... medical mystery. Sounds like the kind of thing I'd be good at. Breaking and entering sounds like the kind of thing you'd be good at.
I take it that's where Cuddy's been keeping your pills.,"One theory, one drawer."
"One theory, one drawer.","Really? I thought you'd be all for this torture House plan. It works, therefore it's good. On the other hand, I don't want to talk you out of this deal by pointing out your hypocrisy so... Patient's life at stake, blah blah blah blah. Forget about the specific nature of the liver dysfunction, it's irrelevant. Dwarf's pRoblem is global, that's why the gallium scan was bright, it's going to spread throughout her entire body unless you stop it."
"If that were true, more than her lungs and liver would be affected.","It will be. It'll spread through the biliary tree and hit her pancreas next. Stop retracing your steps, get ahead of it. Forget the liver and focus on the pancreas 'coz after that... actually after that, it doesn't really matter what it is because all roads lead to a dead dwarf."
I get why you don't want to go to rehab but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.,Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move.
No.,Ow. There's no bruise or nothing but it really hurts.
Unfortunately that pain and lack of bruising is typical of a zygomatic break.,"Wow, sounds bad."
"Hmm, bones are aligned properly. Which ER did you go to after the car accident?",Princeton-Plainsborough. Here's my discharge slip.
"Okay, going to get you some acetaminophen with codeine.","I err... I tried that, it makes me nauseous."
Err... there's a drug called gabapentin which is good for certain kinds of pain.,"Great, I haven't slept in days."
Gabapentin's not really going to help with the sleep.,Oh. Is there something else you could give me?
Vicodin's your best bet with sleep issues.,Thanks so much.
Unfortunately our policy forbids prescribing opiates to new Patients.,How can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?
"Just for the opiates, we find that it helps weed out drug-seekers.",You think I'm a drug-seeker?
I'm not saying that.,Well then give me the vicodin.
I can't.,Because you think I'm a drug-seeker?
I just said I didn't.,"No, you said that the policy was to stop drug-seeking. Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker, policy doesn't apply."
"I'm sorry, that's the policy.",Gabapentin works on nerve damage; you're prescribing it for a broken face! Might as well hand out band aids for a sEvered carotid!
You're a doctor.,Not by this clinic's definition since I'm neither a moron nor a mindless drone!
Security--,"Forget it, I'll throw myself out."
You were right; the Patient's pancreas is failing.,Told you you'd come begging me for help.
Her insulin production is almost non-existent.,"Give me my pills, or lose an arm."
The girl is dying!,So give me my pills.
Take the deal and I will.,You'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills?
I would rather lose one Patient now than the dozens we will lose while you're in prison.,Well have fun explaining that to her itsy bitsy grieving mother.
He is.,"Unless you've got vicodin, go away."
Oh god. I don't have--,"No pills, no eggnog."
What happened to your arm?,Cut myself.
"Wilson was wrong about lymphoma, kid's not losing any weight, no night sweats.",Cuddy send you?
No. She doesn't trust me not to give you pills.,She right?
"House, these cuts are straight in a row. You did this on purpose.","Cutting releases endorphins, endorphins reliEve pain. Can you get me some pills?"
No.,Well then you can leave.
No constitutional symptoms means--,"Soon as the kid gets cured, Cuddy's got no pressure to fold."
You really think she's going to fold?,"Autoimmune fits better than cancer but lupus floods kidneys, usually attacks them first. Kidneys are fine, right?"
"Yeah. House, take the deal. You can survive without vicodin. After you were shot you stayed clean for months.","Yeah, only it had something to do with the absence of pain. No leave that, I want to be able to pour alcohol on it so I can distract myself."
Then you can rip off the bandage.,Kid been sick lately?
Got a history of ear infections.,"You see Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar. The ear infections - they come in, they try to coax him to... to hell with the metaphor. You get the point right?"
"Nerd gets drunk, thrashes the bar. One of the autoimmunes triggered by a minor infection.","Factor in her age, elevated sed rate, anaemia... it's Still's disease. Start her on prednisone, methotrexates, cyclosporin."
I'll order the treatment.,"Your plan isn't working. Two days down, one to go. Figured I'd show you how much it isn't working."
"Yeah, clearly the drugs have no hold on you.","We both know that my pride far surpasses my instinct for self-preservation. You want to redeem yourself, give up now."
And you'll go to jail.,I've done nothing wrong.
And you'll go to jail.,Which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forEver. Nausea's bad this time. You write me a script for Metoclopramide so I can stop puking. They'd give me that in rehab.
House?,"Well, look on the bright side; at least you don't have to go by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore. That's gotta be a relief."
"I'm sorry, he's sick--",You hear my diagnosis on the dwarf? Still's disease. Did you Ever consider those ear infections or you just wrote it off as a dwarf thing? You sure he's dead because doctor Wilson sometimes misses things.
Trying to embarrass me in front of a grieving widow crosses lines that Even--,"Right, I'm pathetic. I'm strung out, I haven't slept, puking Every hour and I still out-diagnosed you. But I'm supposed to let you decide what's best--"
Please! Please leave.,Sorry. I'm done.
"It's not her heart, she's bleeding.",Picking up a script for Zebalusky.
This is err... doctor Wilson's Patient.,"Yeah, Wilson's busy right now what with Mr Zebalusky dying in agony on account of his metastatic lung cancer and not having the pills to reliEve that agony because of some moron pharmacist."
Can I have a french fry?,Get your own.
You took the last ones.,What's wrong with you?
I've got spinal muscular atrophy.,At least it's not contagious. Nice bear.
"House, it's not Still's. Steroids helped until the Patient started bleeding from the ears and mouth.",It's a bear.
"You win, you can have vicodin.","Words have set meanings for a reason, you see an animal like Bill and you try to play fetch, Bill's going to eat you because Bill's a bear."
It's between cancer and autoimmune.,See that's what we call a faulty syllogism. Just because you call Bill a dog doesn't mean that he is... ... a dog. We've got to x-ray our Patient's leg.
Her leg looks fine.,Weird huh?
Why aren't you detoxing?,Willpower.
What--,Normal's not normal if you're not normal.
Did you just take a pill?,No. So how does a dwarf have completely normal growth plates?
How Many pills have you taken?,Not nearly as Many as I'm gonna take. Forgotten how delicious they were.
I didn't give them to him.,Can we forget my vices and get back to my virtues? We were missing the fact that just because we called her a dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf. Everyone assumed she was because of her mother and there's no test for CHH dwarfism so she lost an identity but we've gained a symptom.
"So what connects a long-term pituitary issue with pRoblems in the lungs, liver and pancreas?",Oh you guys and your bickering. Cancer versus autoimmune.
Obviously you think it's something else.,"Nope, I think it's both. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis - also known as you've got your cancer in my autoimmune disease. The immune component responded to the Still's treatment, led to the short-term improvement, the cancer portion didn't."
We dismissed this earlier because there were no neurological symptoms.,"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?"
"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?",This is your pituitary gland and this is the granuloma that's been crushing it. No pituitary equals no growth hormone equals... about that much.
She's not a dwarf?,Just hormonally challenged.
What about my mom?,"Your mom's the real deal. You're just a tiny little poser. The recent ear infections caused your body to release a cascade of these same cells that made the granuloma, attacked your lungs, moved on to your liver then hitched a ride over to your pancreas. We can nuke them with a mild course of chemo then remove the granuloma."
And then what? What will happen to her then?,Let me see if I can make this clear. This pill represents... a pill. And my mouth represents your daughter's mouth. We deposit the pill in the mouth. You may nEver be tall enough to play in the WNBA but you should be able to post up your mom no pRoblem.
What if I don't take the pills? What if you remove the thing in my head and give me the chemo but not the pills? Would I still get better?,Your body needs growth hormone for lots of things like... to grow.
I like who I am now.,Nobody your age likes who they are now.
I do.,"You like needing help when you want something off the high shelf? Not being able to press an elevator button above the eighth floor, having to smell ass Every time you stand in line? You don't need growth hormone; it's just your ticket out of the freak show."
Can't you deliver a diagnosis without making her feel that her life isn't worth living?,I'm trying to help her.
You're trying to make her taller.,Not too tall. Just tall enough to wipe her own butt.
Are you high?,Higher than you.
"If my daughter doesn't want to choose the easy path, I won't force her to.",Then you're a lousy mom. You want your daughter to be a freak.
We're not freaks.,You want her to overcome adversity.
Yes.,"Then why stop at height? Poke a stick in her eye, imagine how interesting she'll be then."
Being little is not the same--,"You and I have found that being normal sucks because we're freaks. Advantage of being a freak is that it makes you stronger. How strong do you really want her to have to be? Tell her what you have to tell her, now you tell her you lied, Even if you didn't."
Abigail agreed-- Abigail agreed to take growth hormone.,Who's Abigail?
Your non-dwarf dwarf Patient.,"Oh, good. Then the growth hormone makes sense."
Christmas Eve.,"Yeah, I know. Deal expires tomorrow."
You've plans for tonight?,You worried I'm going to be popping more pills?
Thought you might prefer people over pills.,"Hey mom, I guess you guys are already up at Aunt Sarah's. I'm sure dad's in the eggnog and you're pRobably suffering through another dried out turkey. Just wanted to say Merry Christmas."
House? Are you okay? I called 3 times.,I'm ready to take the deal.
That's off the table.,The clock doesn't expire until--
Speaking engagement.,Not guilty.
And on the charge of gaining control of said medication by fraud how do you plead?,Not guilty.
You're going to go talk to him?,I was just going to ask him where he gets his haircut.
"Except that he wasn't the Patient or the doctor, he was the guy who stole from the Patient and the doctor. This was the 3rd time he's been disorientated in the last 2 weeks.","Running into smoke filled burning buildings can be a bit disorienting. Fortunately I have the cure, stop doing it."
A hypothalamic tumour can cause vacillating temperatures.,So could ER nurses who were too busy to notice that a Patient likes both hot coffee and cold sodas
"He tested negative for Hep C, TB, HIV, Lyme and his tox screen's clean.","In case you hadn't noticed, not exactly in the mood to dance."
"I'm not asking you to dance, I'm asking you to do your job.","EKG showed arrhythmia, pRobably just a mild heart attack."
"He was in the burn unit for six months and had multiple surgeries, could be a hospital acquired infection maybe MRSA.","Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage."
"Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage.","If you called to see the design for my prison tatts, they're still at R and D."
You need to talk to Tritter.,Not according to my Lawyer.
"Your Lawyer isn't going to be able to get the DA to drop the case, Tritter can.","Yeah, you know what else Tritter can do?"
You're not impressing anyone. You may call yourself principled but what you really are is a stubborn adolescent idiot! This isn't his fault.,I'm not the one who--
"YOU used the rectal thermometer on him, YOU insulted him instead of apologising, YOU flaunted your drug use in his face and you REFUSED to accept a deal...",I accepted the deal!
Not until after you stole a dead guy's pills.,Allegedly.
He's seeing blue where'd you get the script from?,Cuddy. Wanna know what I gave her?
If it was thallium he'd be losing his hair.,So maybe it's menopause.
"Yes, his age is the reason it's weird that a Man has menopause.","Male menopause, high oestrogen, low testosterone, explains temperature swings, disorientation, endocrinologically similar to female menopause but without the vaginas and mah-jong tiles."
Male menopause doesn't explain the vision.,"Blue vision isn't a symptom, it's a side effect of Viagra, it's right there on the label, which I have no reason to have read except that I'm a doctor, but then..."
He's not taking Viagra.,"You mean he didn't tell YOU he was taking Viagra, and I don't care how sick he is, trust me, he still thinks he's got a shot. Menopause causes temperature swings, limpness, limpness causes pills, pills cause the blueness."
He's presenting no other signs of premature aging.,"Aging's not the only cause, you said he's got burns to 54% of his body, sure it's not 55%?"
Burns to his genitals could cause testicular trauma.,Which could in turn cause...
Which could in turn cause...,"Run a hormone panel, comes back positive pump him full of testosterone and send him home. And stop following me."
"Complaint department's across the hall I'm busy, can I just assume that you told me how unfair I'm being and...","I'm sorry... You could throw a dart at all the adjectives between arrogant and unhinged and I'm sure you'd hit one that describes me. There's a reason I operate that way... I live in pain. Pain that on good days is merely intolerable and on bad ones will suck the life-force right out of you. Doesn't mean that I've handled this right, actually, means I was wrong."
Thank you. I know that couldn't have been easy for you to say. Even if you don't mean a word of it.,I'm sorry! You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.
"Aggression comes on that fast, it's gotta have a neurologic basis. We should do a CT for frontal lobe tumour and an LP for meningitis.","Great, have at it."
"That's it, no challenging our theory, no tearing us down.","No need, you got it under control."
Where you going?,Upstairs this time.
To do what?,Check myself into rehab.
Did Tritter offer you another deal?,"Nope, this is all me. So no slaps on the back? Encouraging words..."
We are just trying to understand what this is.,"I hope this is me detoxing, otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair of underwear last night for nothing."
"So this is for real, this is not just a show for Tritter?","Absolutely it's a show for Tritter, and the Judge, unfortunately unless it's real, there is no show. Hey if it doesn't help my case at least I'll go to prison with heightened senses, all the better to enjoy my strolls around the yard."
Going to need to check that stuff.,"When I lead the big Patient rebellion, Voldemort here is the first to go."
"He may nEver be ready, you're doing the only thing you can do, keep trying. How about you Greg? You thought about how to fix things with people in your life?","No need, people in my life have no expectations of me, makes all our lives easier."
Apparently not. The first step in recovery...,"Is admitting I have a pRoblem, I've obviously already done that or I wouldn't be here. I've Even embraced step 2, I've admitted there's a higher power, may not be a god per se... but that Andre the giant guy was powerful. Where I start to butt up against it is step 3, surrendering my will to this higher power. I'm sure Andre's ghost has my back and all but my free will, I nEver leave home without it."
Kinda like your pills. If you could do this on your own I assume you wouldn't be here.,True.
It's not his lungs! He's got marked ST elevation he's having a heart attack,Pick a colour.
Medication time.,You are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.
We don't have an answer yet.,"I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking! WhoEver came up with buprenorphine to wean off Vicodin should be shot. And then stabbed in the eye I think someone needs to adjust my meds!"
The heart shows no sign of inflammation or...,"The cause of the heart attacks isn't internal it must be external, something environmental."
None of the attacks happened in the same place.,Still must be something in common.
His clothes were all different he'd been cleaned.,"That's the what's, how bout the who's?"
His partner Amy was at all three attacks but...,Anyone else?
People don't cause heart attacks.,Well then you should be worried about proving me wrong.
"We were clearing rooms in an office building fire, the ceiling collapsed and it cut me off from the rest of the group. I kept yelling that I was fine but Derek refused to wait for the team to clear the Debris so he took off looking for another access point. He got caught in a back draft. He almost died because of me once. And now it's happening again.","You're not my mom, you don't have to keep checking up on me."
How you doing?,"Not bad, considering I just learned that I'm completely powerless."
See this big fancy wing? It was built because this program works,"Faulty logic. This big fancy wing exists because some people with money think that it works. They wanna beliEve that they can buy a better world. This is nothing short of idealised despair, let people wallow in it."
I don't Even know what that means.,None of this means anything. It's just nonsensical slogans and platitudes.
Meaning takes time. It takes work.,What do you think I've been doing?
"You've been here for two days! Talk about wallowing in it. We all get it, we know how much pain you have. You're here to deal with that and get on with your life.",Right! I should have an affair with a dying Patient and move into a hotel.
You're a coward House. You find fault in Everybody because you're afraid to look at yourself.,"Thanks, I was running short on platitudes, you can leave now."
"But if you're too worried about losing your job to get it treated they can dEvelop into full on heart attacks, you think it's a coincidence this started when Amy got engaged?","No I don't, but now that you know the why what are you going to do to stop the how?"
We need to put him on antidepressants.,"Not if you're right. Antidepressants would inhibit his autonomic nervous system, which would only speed up the heart attacks."
"We could try propylthiouracil, slow down his metabolic rate.",Thyroid effect would only weaken the heart.
Only other option is blood thinners.,"This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled arteries and a swollen heart, he's a guy who's brain is trying to kill his heart."
"Chase's idea is as good as any, I mean short of frying his brain and wiping Amy out, we're screwed.",We need Cuddy.
Why?,So you can tell her why you need to fry a guy's brain.
The guy's heart isn't working and you want to shock his brain?,Electroshock therapy is the only way to erase his memories of Amy and stop the brain's chemical attack on the heart.
"This isn't 1940, the pRoblem can be controlled with antidepressants.",Cameron.
"Antidepressants would inhibit his autonomic nervous system, speed up the attacks.","LMNO, PTU, blood thinners, none of them would solve this pRoblem. He's got a real-life harlequin roMance in his head, were going to pull out the 1940s playbook. Bilateral electrodes, high stimulus sine wave intensity, turning that dial all the way to 11. It's basic brain chemistry, we interrupt protein synthesis altering the neurotransmitter system, the result, no memories, no Amy, no pRoblem."
Go ahead.,"You heard the lady, go plug him in Am I really that pathetic?"
What are you talking about?,"If I'd pitched electroshock therapy as a cure for broken heart syndrome any other time, you'd have dug in and maybe tried another 100 useless things first. So either you're actually beginning to trust me or... you just feel sorry for me."
Caterpillar?,Lower intestine with ulcerative colitis. You crash art therapy classes just for the adrenalin rush?
"Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until I promised I'd come see for myself. I gotta admit, this move I did not expect.","Well don't tell anyone but the photos of smiling people in the brochures, it's just marketing."
Well you're obviously making an effort. So I suppose the next step is for me to talk to the DA.,Which you have no intention of doing.
No.,"So words mean nothing, actions mean nothing, what the hell is left?"
"So words mean nothing, actions mean nothing, what the hell is left?","You son of a bitch! What about your words, your actions. Gotta get House cleaned up, get him to show some humility, when it comes to actually doing something you prove that all you care about is bitch slapping a guy who refused to kiss your ass."
You Ever trust an addict? You Ever give one the benefit of the doubt? How Many times did it work out for you?,"Yeah yeah yeah, I get it, so you were screwed over by your mother, your wife, your partner, but you keep sending them Christmas cards while you take it out on Everyone else."
"We've given him four rounds of electroshock, the charge made his voice a little higher but the EKG and BP are good.",Good.
"Going to give him his last round in the morning, then be at court for your hearing.",Thanks.
"I'm going to stay here, monitor Derek.","Thanks for the update. My next condolence call is arriving, I'll see you guys tomorrow"
I got you something.,Nice.
I figured it might help make a good impression on the Judge.,"It's not that nice... I had no business blaming you for any of this. I know you were just trying to help me, protect me, that's what friends do."
Is this.... an apology?,"Part of the program, if you don't like it I can stop."
Turn it off.,I told you nEver to call me when I'm on trial.
Hold on Mr Vickers.,Thanks Your Honour hard to hear. You test for clotting time and LB function?
His blood's normal and his heart's pumping it up to the brain,"But it's not all getting there, something's obstructing the blood flow."
"There's no hyper-intensity to suggest a foreign body near the region, and no signs of infection or vascular malformation.",It's lower down.
Dr House! Now!,Hang on a second. Does your voice always get that high and annoying when you're angry?
Do you want to go to jail?,"No thank you. Set him up for a selective vertebral angiography, I'm on my way."
"House, sit down.","Why? I'm bored, there's nothing I can say or do that's going to make a difference here."
Are you out of your mind?,"They said they wanted me there, but I don't think they liked me. His voice isn't high because of the electrical charges; it's another symptom of menopause. His system keeps getting hit by women's issues, so let's follow the pattern. What might obstruct the blood flow that's more common in women than men? Is the catheter in?"
"Go back to court, we will let you know the results.",Shut up and wire him.
Shut up and wire him.,"Centre the image in the interpeduncular cistern, keep it moving at 30 frames per second."
You think the arteries are narrowing; you're going to need still shots which WE can do without you.,"The pRoblem is not how wide the road is, it's a guy with a squeegee on the sidewalk, flagging cars. That's what's causing the slowdown, we find him we find the pRoblem."
He's wired.,Go!
Injecting the dye. Blood's in the capillaries.,"There! Mr Squeegee, spinal meningioma, pushing on the nerves to the vocal chords. Creates the voice change and that nerve just happens to live right near the meningeal branch of the vertebral artery, obstructs the blood flow to the brain, brain malfunctions creating false memories, memories cause love, love kills. And we didn't completely screw up; cleaning the slate bought us time to find the real pRoblem. On the other hand, if we'd been better we wouldn't have needed the time. Schedule him for surgery, dig that thing out and he can start enjoying real misery instead of the fake stuff."
House I just heard that you apologised to Wilson.,"Detoxing, I didn't know what I was saying."
"Detoxing, I didn't know what I was saying.",Excuse me I have to go to jail.
Yes.,"Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt."
I hope you don't mind that we continued on without you?,I said I was sorry there's no need to be sarcastic.
Dr House.,So should I be looking for you in the shadows? Flinch Every time a car backfires?
Surprised to see you're not spooning your way through the walls.,So what do you say? How about a conjugal visit to celebrate?
Your buprenorphine.,You get these from the pharmacy or from Voldemort?
"That's Vicodin, he's been slipping you Vicodin?",No... He'd be risking his minimum wage job to do that.
The whole time?,My higher power said it was ok.
Nothing's changed?,Nothing's changed.
"The apology, you didn't need to do that to make this work.",BeliEve what you want.
"Goodnight House, I'll see ya tomorrow.",Goodnight Wilson.
Goodnight Wilson.,How can I help you this beautiful morning?
You got any cases?,Three. Got a teenage African-American lung transplant...
"Next few days, you'll be doing nothing but clinic work.",I just said...
You were lying.,Then why'd you ask?
"Because if you told the truth, I was gonna give you only one day of clinic duty.",That's dishonest. In refuse to participate in this...
"You'll do it. You owe me. I kept you out of jail, I can put you back.",Perjurer.
Felon.,How can I help you this beautiful morning?
I think I have a...,Who is here for a runny nose?
Who is here for a runny nose?,It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home!
It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home!,Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds.
Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds.,"You'll be assigned a doctor, who is not me, 'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches."
Call security.,"No, I'm good, thanks."
Head on fire!!,Need a team here!
Little late.,Just in time.
What did you give him?,Paralytic.
Why would you do that?!,Somebody had to stop the screaming.
Then he's still in pain.,Yeah! But quietly.
Yeah! But quietly.,"Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forEver."
"Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forEver.","So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk."
"So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk.",I think the latter choice is better for all three of us.
He's sedated. It took five cc's of haliperidol to get him down after the paralytic wore off.,"So, pain in his right ear, psychotic behaviour and dizziness. Go!"
Nurses said he was holding his head. How d'you know it was specifically his ear?,Because he was dizzy. Means the pRoblem was affecting his inner ear.
Nurses said he was running in circles. Doesn't mean he was dizzy.,He wasn't running in circles. He was running in oblongs. Looked like a three-year-old kid drew them.
Acoustic Neuroma that started a haemorrhage.,"'Splains the pain, vertigo, Everything. Get an MRI."
"'Splains the pain, vertigo, Everything. Get an MRI.",What else?
"If it explains Everything, what...?",It might not explain Everything.
"What if he was psychotic first? Then self-mutilated, damaged the ear.",Excellent. Need a complete psyParkatric work-up.
Excellent. Need a complete psyParkatric work-up.,Your turn.
"Uhh, I was... gonna say what Foreman...","Well, say something else."
He... came to the clinic.,Goood...
"Decent chance he had a chronic illness first, 'specially given the rapid heart rate.",Hmm.
"Lingering ear infection. Pressure builds up in his inner ear, bursts through the","Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a complete blood count."
"Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a complete blood count.","Oh, while you're at it, pour some alcohol into his ear and take out the cockroach."
He has a cockroach in his ear?,"He was scratParkng that ear right before the Event, so I took a peek. My guess is, it started biting."
Nothing else wrong with him?,Wasn't that enough? Pretty gross.
"So, why are we doing the tests?","Well, it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty. Do the tests or just stay out of Cuddy's sight, I don't really care which."
Why are you here?,Because it's not a hospital.
It's a jogging Park. You're not jogging. You can't jog.,"WatParkng jogging. I sit, I watch, I imagine."
So... what do you watch for?,That guy's running in shorts.
"He's not jogging, he's trolling.",You're good at this.
How long are you goin' to stay here?,Beauty of this place is that it's the last place Cuddy will look.
You ordered a CT on a Patient with a bug in his ear?,How'd you know I was here?
Ran into Cameron in the clinic.,"""Ran into""?"
You ordered pointless tests just to...,"Wouldn't've been pointless if you didn't ""run into"" Cameron."
Is that Vicodin?,Breath mint. Thought you were gonna kiss me.
What happened to rehab?,I got out.
It was a scam?,Enough foreplay. You gonna kiss me or not?
You are going back to the clinic. Or jail.,You perjured yourself to keep me out of jail. How're you...?
I only did that because I thought you were getting clean.,So it's do clinic duty or go to jail.
Yes.,Then it'll be finish your paperwork or go to jail. Help with fundraising or go to jail. Do your job or go to jail. I think I'd rather go to jail.

I'm ready to be Judged.,Okay! Fifty dollars...!
Okay! Fifty dollars...!,...to any Patient who's willing to leave here right now.
House! You can't...,My money.
I don't care. People do not...,"They leave, fifty bucks. They're not all that sick."
And desperate. Which was why this place is here.,"If they're that poor, then they'd rather have fifty bucks."
Can I have the money?,"Look. It's monogrammed. He doesn't need money. Ergo, he's not sick."
And the blood?,Could be anybody's. Monogram's definitely his.
We need to talk.,"Doesn't matter what you say, do or threaten. I will find a way out."
How can we make this more interesting for you?,How can we make the sky green? How can we make the tall short? You cannot make the uninteresting interesting.

No.,"Why? Think if I deal with enough people, I'll find some huManity?"

You're just saying that so I'll see the psyParkatrist.,"True. 'Cept for the word ""just"". I'm saying, I don't wanna treat you so you'll see the psyParkatrist and because I don't wanna treat you."
Why don't you wanna treat me anymore?,I nEver wanted to treat you. Fact that you were raped holds no interest for me. It's nothing personal. There's nothing to treat. You're physically healthy.
But I want you to be my doctor.,Why?
I don't know.,You gotta have a reason. Everything has a reason.
I trust you.,"Ah, see, that's a bad reason. 'Cause I'll lie to you. I'll tell you anything just to get you out of here."

What did she do to you?,"Parents travelled a lot, leaving me with her. She liked things the way she liked them. She beliEved in discipline. She was right, I suppose. I hardly Ever screwed up when she was around. Too scared of... being forced to sleep in the yard or take a bath in ice. Your turn."
"Your parents, they-they nEver stopped her?",NEver told them.
Why not?,"Usual reasons. I was afraid they wouldn't beliEve me and I was afraid they'd think I' done something wrong. I opened up to you, you open up to me."
What did you call her?,Oma.
And you kept calling her that after this?,"Dutch for ""grandmother"". She's still my grandmother. And she was still Dutch."
Is any part of that story true?,All of it.
"You wouldn't keep calling her ""Oma"". Something would have to change.",You don't know me.
"You wouldn't keep calling her ""Oma""!","Look, you're overreacting."
Do not dismiss me!,Not dismissing you. Saying you're not acting rationally.
I'm angry because you're lying to me.,No. You're...
What can I do? What the hell can I do that you're not gonna dismiss as just being because I was raped?,Nothing.
Your story. Is it true?,True for somebody.
But not for you.,These things happen. Happened to somebody. What do you care if it happened to me?
They're not in this room.,"No! They're out there! Doctors, Lawyers,... postal workers! Some of them doing great, some of them doing lousy! You're gonna base your whole life on who you got stuck in a room with?"
House.,You gotta get me out of this. There's nothing to diagnose. There's nothing...
You only tested her for STDs?,"I had sEven morons who forgot their raincoats. 'S all they asked for, so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?"
I wasted their time. She's pregnant.,You understand? You okay? I know you're not okay. Are you more or less not okay than you were five minutes ago.
About the same.,Termination procedure is unpleasant.
I don't wanna terminate.,You wanna keep the baby?
Abortion is murder.,True. It's a life. And you should end it.
Every life is sacred.,"Talk to me, don't quote me bumper stickers."
It's true.,It's meaningless.
It means Every life matters to God.,"Not to me, not to you. Judging by the number of natural disasters, not to God either."
You're just being argumentative.,Yeah! I do do that. What about Hitler? Is his life sacred to God? Father of your Parkld? Is his life sacred to you?
My Parkld isn't Hitler.,Either Every life is sacred or...
Stop it! I don't wanna chat about philosophy!,You're not killing your rape baby because of a philosophy.
It's murder! I'm against it. You for it?,Not as a general rule.
Just for unborn Parkldren?,"Yes! The pRoblem with exceptions to rules is the line drawn. Might makes sense for us to kill the ass that did this to you. But where do we draw the line? Which asses do we get to kill? Which asses get to keep on being asses? Nice thing about the abortion Debate is we can quibble over trimesters, but ultimately there's an ice-cold line - birth. Morally, there isn't a lot of difference. Practically, huge."
You're enjoying this conversation.,This is the type of conversation I do well.
But the other type? The personal stuff?,"There are no answers.If there are no answers, why talk about it?"
"There are no answers.If there are no answers, why talk about it?",You're healthy. You shouldn't be here.
I don't wanna go.,Fine. I won't discharge you. Wanna go for a walk?
"No! I just need to die, knowing that something is different because I was here.",Life goes on.
Is that the reason we're out here?,"Know why I come here? I sit, I watch, I imagine."
Sounds nice.,Imagine if one of them would break a leg.
Imagine if one of them would break a leg.,Just one false step. One crack in the sidewalk.
You don't really.,I'm evil.
Evil people don't say they're evil.,"Sounds like an easy loophole. People can do good things, but their instincts are not good. Either God doesn't exist or he's unimaginably cruel."
I don't beliEve that.,What do you beliEve? Why do you think this happened?
I don't wanna talk about it.,Me neither. Too bad.
"Y'know, I don't think there was a reason!","Huh-huh. So God does exist, 'less you get raped. Easier to keep your rape baby for no reason."
Maybe he was challenging me!,He hurts you to help you.
He hurts you to help you.,I guess it's better than he hates you.
You're trying to convince me there's no God! Why would you Even say something like that?,Because you're throwing your life away.
I'm doing what I beliEve!,What you beliEve doesn't make sense.
This is not helping me.,Then I can't help you.
Then I can't help you.,"If you beliEve in eternity, then... life is irrelevant. Same way that a bug is irrelevant in comparison to the universe."
"If you don't beliEve in eternity, then what you do here is irrelevant.",Your actions here are all that matters.
Then nothing matters. There's no ultimate consequences. I couldn't live with that.,So you need to think that the guy that did this to you is gonna be punished.
I need to know that it all means something. I need that comfort.,Yeah. You feeling comfortable? Feeling good right now? Feeling warm inside?
Do you think the guy who did this to me feels bad?,That'll help you? Make you feel better?
"Why do you always do that? Ask why I'm asking a question, instead of just answering the question.",The answer doesn't interest me. I don't care what he's feeling. I'm interested in what you're feeling.
You are?,"I'm trapped in a room with you, right?"
"I'm trapped in a room with you, right?",Why did you choose me?
There's something about you. 'S like you're hurt too.,It was true.
What was?,"Wasn't my grandmother, but it was true."
Who was it?,It's my dad.
I'd like to tell you what happened to me now.,I'd like to hear it.
It was a friend's birthday party...,She terminated it. She's been discharged.
She's gonna be okay.,"Yeah, it's that simple."
She's talking about what happened. That's huge. You did good.,"Everyone will tell you... that that's what we gotta make her do. We have to help her, right? Except we can't. We drag out her story. Tell each other that it'll help her heal. Feel real good about ourselves. But all we've done is make a girl cry."
Then why did you...?,Because I don't know.
You gonna follow up with her?,"One day, one room."
Sixteen year old. Respiratory arrest.,The only thing I hate more than a thief is a crippled thief.
"Yeah, me too. No sign of trauma. No history of asthma or allerg!",Who the hell is J. Whitner?
"No idea. Stevie Lippa, his EKG and Echocardiogram were normal.",Normal is good. Send him home. J. Whitner. Doctor. Who is he and where do I find him?
Doesn't mean she's not hot.,Just means she can't bend over. So Cuddy has to bend over backward.
Sixteen year old kid. ER workup rEvealed a bloody pleural effusion.,That's odd.
Yeah. That occurred to me.,What took you so long to mention it?
"Just means he wasn't on drugs, not that he hasn't been using drugs.",Looks like a plumbing pRoblem to me. Leaky pipes.
"If he popped an aneurysm he'd be in the morgue, not the ER.","That's why you're going to do a venogram instead of an arteriogram. This isn't a high pressure burst, it's a low pressure leak."
It still could have been drugs that cause the pipes to corrode in the first place.,So go look under his mattress. See if he's got any pills or powders stashed with the hand lotion.
So go look under his mattress. See if he's got any pills or powders stashed with the hand lotion.,Sweet ride. I asked for the one with the sissy bar and the banana seat but Santa gave me this instead. I guess that's what I get for being naughty.
You must be Dr. House.,"Yeah. So, looks like there's been some sort of mix-up at the Parking office."
They had to move me closer to the door.,Had to? You don't look like the type to pull a weapon.
Wheelchair.,Cane. I think you should do the honorable thing. Let me have my space back.
"Oh, well, uh. Since you ask so nicely!wheelchair.",Cane. Walking long distances makes my leg hurt.
And it's easy for me.,Course not. Pushing that little lEver. Thumb muscles must burn. I'm sure the last ten yards are pure torture.
Crossing the Parking lot is dangerous. Cars can't see me.,You Ever hit a patch of black ice with a cane?
"No. Gosh, on account of the fact that I can't walk. Maybe you should ask the Parking office for some crampons.",This is about who can most easily cross the Parking lot. You're the winner.
You can't be serious.,Actually I can. See. It's my space and I want it back.
It's not your space. It's the hospital's space. And the hospital thinks the person who's worse off should get the better space. Your application for a handicapped space says you can walk 50 yards.,And Whitner's says she can roll 50 miles between oil changes. I can't change my leg.
The space I moved you to is only 46 yards away from the front door. I measured. You'll be fine.,Great. So I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.
As long as it's not in my office.,You know who won the New York City marathon six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair!
Then go get yourself one and leave me alone.,"Give me my space, I'll be happy to roll around in one all day."
You couldn't last a week in a wheelchair.,Wanna bet?
What's wrong with you?,Nothing that a week off my feet won't solve.
Venogram's negative. No leak.,You mean you couldn't find the leak.
Is your leg worse?,No. My Parking spot is. Blood is only made inside the circulatory system. Which means when you find outside!
You're going to spend a week in a wheelchair just to get a Parking closer to the front door.,Easier than chopping off my legs.
Kind of. He's RoMany. Apparently they feel the need to keep secrets so it's hard to know anything for sure.,Yeah. He's also a huMan being. Which means you shouldn't be trusting him to begin with. Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.
It's a deep vein thrombosis. The kid spent 16 hours in the back seat of an old pickup. Causes a clot and makes its way to his lungs. We should do an arteriogram and find the clot and bust it with tPA.,Or we should find the leak.
There's no leak.,"Hey. You can't yell at a guy in a wheelchair. This is a slow leak. You gotta speed it up. Thin his blood, redo the venogram."
That could cause a massive bleed.,Excellent. Massive will be Even easier to find. Pardon me. I guess you guys are going to have to get the next one.
Ow. The kid's liver's failing because of massive clots blocking his hepatic vein. How can he have both a bleed and a clot?,It's not a clot. You must have blocked the vein with a catheter wire.
There's no heart failure or cirrhosis. Means it has to be a clot.,"Massive clots block veins, they don't Even leak. Since he clearly has some kind of!"
You having a little pRoblem?,"Would you mind? Boy, that was humiliating. How does Whitner make it through the day?"
Pride goeth before the fall.,"Lucky for me, I'm sitting in one of these babies. So, what other theories can I shoot down?"
DIC would explain both the!,His platelets are normal. His PCT isn't elevated.
Leukemia?,"Normal CBC and!differential? You guys are still thinking like doctors when you should be thinking like plumbers. Come on, I wanna see some butt crack. Something inside the liver is punParkng holes in the pipes. Blood bleeds through the openings, sticks to the intruder, forms a mass."
A clot.,A mass.
So could a granuloma from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.,"Do a CT, MRI, sputum and ACE lEvel. Excuse me, sorry, cripple coming through."
He says his throat hurts.,That phrasing means you think it doesn't.
"No, I don't.",Good enough for me.
Where are you going?,Mothers know best. Get yourself a sucker on the way out.
"Look, I think he's just faking so he doesn't have to go to school.",How did you know I was a truant Officer?
"I told him he had a choice ""ï¿½ go to school or the doctor.",Right. He's wasting your precious time so you decided to waste mine. How thoughtful. I'm in a wheelchair so I can't examine him all the way up there. Hop down. My life is just one horror after another. Open.
Does it look like it hurts?,Nope.
What's that?,Syringe. I'm with you. Make him hate the doctor's office more than he hates school.
That's okay. I don't! I don't think that!,"It's just saline. It hurts like hell when it's injected directly into the muscle. So, what do you think? Arm or ass?"
I think he's learned his lesson.,"Oh, I don't know. You'd better check. Jack, is your mommy a big, fat idiot? Well, what do you know! I guess you were right."
What are you going to do now?,"Oh, now I've gotta slide my butt from one padded seat to another. What if I bump my knee?"
MRI showed a granuloma in his liver.,Fantastic. Wanna give me a hand here?
"No. Clotting, bleeding and a granuloma equals Wegener's.","I know. That's why I said ""fantastic.""ï¿½ I was being sincere. Now give me a hand."
Wouldn't be fair. We're going to biopsy the liver to confirm.,It wouldn't be fair not to. People are good and kind and gentle and help people in wheelchairs.
No.,You do.
"No, I don't.","Foreman, forget the biopsy. His liver will be gone before you get the results. Start treatment with cyclophosphamide before the Wegener's punches a hole in another pipe."
"Ah yes, if it isn't Dr. Ironside.","Ah, if it isn't Dr. I-Had-No-Friends-When-I-Was-Growing-Up-So-All-I-Did-Was-Watch-TV-By-Myself-Which-Is-Why-I-Can-Now-Make-Constant-Pop-Culture-References-Which-No-One-Understands-But-Me."
That's my name. Don't wear it out. Uh uh.,Safe from Cuddy but I guess not from her trusted ratcomplice.
Reasonable people don't Debate the relative merits of their handicaps.,"Reasonable people make rules based on evidence. Like difficulty covering a distance ""ï¿½ say 50 yards. Not some pre-ordained patheticness scale."
"Last I checked, pig-headedness was not the eighth heavenly virtue.",It's only pig-headed if you're wrong. If you're right we call it sticking to your principles.
Give it up. You're demeaning yourself.,That's what they told Rosa Parks.
Liver's actually improving. We plug one hole and end up poking another.,We talking about the Patient or how to get a raise from Cuddy?
The Wegener's treatment gave him a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.,Which means! it's Wegener's.
We were treating him for Wegener's when Everything went wrong.,Not Everything.
"Yeah. It was a very lovely day outside. On the other hand, the treatment made him worse!","The treatment made his bladder worse, not his liver."
Clot in the liver is breaking up.,"And MRI, sputum and ACE ruled out TB, sarcoidosis and lymphoma. Which leaves us with!"
Still could be a cancer with multiple!,"A cancer we can't see on MRI, CT or blood tests?"
It's Wegener's.,It's not the wrong diagnosis. It's the wrong treatment.
We can't give methotrexate to a kid who's already had lung pRoblems.,Methotrexate is carpet bombing. Hits Everything. We need a smart bomb. We don't suppress the immune system. We change it. Immune modulation. FT-28. His antibodies are attacking his blood vessels. The irritation causes them to bleed and clot. We change his immune system so the antibodies don't interact with his blood vessels but work fine Everywhere else.
FT-28 is still experimental. It's not FDA approved.,It's worked for Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.
He doesn't have Crohn's or arthritis.,Let's say that he does. And start the treatment.
"We want our son treated, not experimented on. If you don't know how to do that, then just tell us so we can take him someplace where they do.",They're absolutely right. Stay away from that unproven experimental stuff. Much better to stick with the moving the furniture until he gets better approach.
"Yes, you're right. We're going to have to come up with something else.","You mean another last ditch desperation move? You got anything? Go back and don't take ""no""ï¿½ for an answer. What kind of salesMan are you?"
The kind who avoids the House with the crazy couple who put tin foil over their windows.,"They got money for tin foil, they got money for whatEver you're selling."
What's that mean?,"It means that if they don't trust you, you should earn that lack of trust."
What does paying for tin foil mean?,"Why should I have to answer all the questions? Ooops. Sorry, still getting used to the power steering. I assume you've heard the news."
"I'm not worried. From what I hear, what you lack in shame, you also lack in willpower.","My will may be weak but my backbone is strong. And pain-free now that I've stopped using the cane. Of course it's harder to look down Cuddy's shirt. But then the vantage point on her ass is much improved. But then that's just me ""ï¿½ always looking on the bright side. I'm the guy who said her c-cups are half full."
"They are nice, aren't they?","No, no, no, no, no. You're not going to win me over that easily. You may have a wheel. That doesn't mean you get the grease. You gotta squeak."
"Keep him open. If I confirm Wegener's, we might as well stage the disease while he's still on the table.",What's taking so long?
"External capsules ruptured but still intact. No signs of a clot or a bleed. Normal follicles, normal lymphoid tissue.",The spleen is ripped to shreds. There's gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.
"That's all I need to know. Let's go, people.",Run his bowel.
No need. I'm closing. Suture.,Run his bowel.
Nothing suspicious in the spleen. Get him out of here.,You missed it. He had a granuloma in his liver.
"No, it was just scar tissue. Looked like a granuloma on the MRI but it's not. I don't know why I'm Debating this. Pass me the Kelly clamp. I'm closing.",Not unless you're going to sew my hand in this kid's stomach.
Get out of there. He's unstable.,He's got Wegener's. Which means he's got granulomas.
I'm calling my Lawyer.,"It's only 26 feet. If he were an ostrich, you'd have a 46 foot wait."
Blood pressure's dropping.,Hang another bag of Ringer's lactate.
I'm having nothing to do with this.,"Foreman, hang another bag!"
Ringer's lactate. Got it.,"Come on, come on. It's gotta be in here. But it's not."
Mind if we close?,"Well, it's a good thing we nEver sold him on FT-28. His parents were right."
You can add the surgical team to the list of people who won't let us near him.,"Bleeds, clots, bleeds, clots. Spleen explodes."
We should test him for Von Willebrand's.,"Or, let's play tic tac toe. Okay, Xs are bleeds, Os are clots. Started in the lungs, right? What did we do?"
"CT, sputum, two venograms.","That's one bleed, one clot. Then what?"
"Liver shut down. MRI, labs. Treated with cyclophosphamide.","Whereupon, he peed out three units of O negative. And a bleed."
Where is this going?,I don't know yet. What's next?
High resolution CT scan and UA and urine sediment.,GI tract?
You ran the small bowel in the OR.,Large bowel is fixed to the abdominal wall. I didn't run that.
Because there's not reason to. He hasn't been having any symptoms in his bowels.,Do a colonoscopy.
Because he's had no symptoms?,"You lose your keys, the first thing you do is look Everywhere you might logically have placed them. When you don't find them, then you start looking in other places ""ï¿½ the medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox. We need to look in this kid's mailbox."
Why don't we x-ray his feet? They're fine too.,Because we need to take the center square to block.
He's in the ICU now. His parents only have limited visiting privileges.,I like that kid. He's got spunk.
I like that kid. He's got spunk.,Can't talk now. On guard duty.
You're still in that thing.,What thing? Oh this? Forgot it was Even there.
"You know, Even if you Manage not to get struck down by a bolt of lightening and make it a week, Cuddy's not going to give you the space. She can't.",A bet's a bet.
Yes. And that rule outranks the Americans with Disabilities Act. You think you've got logic on your side. But Whitner's got the legal system. And legal beats logic Every time. Just ask OJ.,You're right.
I am?,Yeah.
So you're doing this Even though you know you've got no legal leg to stand on.,Who needs legs when you got wheels. I'm gonna get that spot. No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.
What'd you say?,I'll see you later. Gonna have them yelling at me for the next 20 minutes.
Oh ho ho ho.,"This is my last day living the life of leisure. So, are you going to tell Dr. Whitner she's out of my space or can I?"
Why would I do that?,"Because, you said that you would. And lying is wrong."
I said I would give you the space if you made it a whole week!,Which I...
You didn't. The bet didn't stipulate that you had to be in the chair for a week unless you had to barge into an operating room and shove your hands in a kid's bowels.,How'd you know about that?
You lost.,I saved a life. Two minutes out of the chair to save a kid's life.
"You lost, House.",I earned that space.
No you didn't.,I earn that space Every day I limp into that building and do my damn job.
You lo-hos-ost.,"Hey You were nEver going to give me that space, were you? I saw Whitner the other day. She knew about the bet. Didn't seem that worried."
She knew I'd win.,"She doesn't know me. In fact she doesn't know anything except what you tell her. And you told her that you were nEver going to give me that space, didn't you? Just tell me ""ï¿½ do you at least feel a little guilty? If you want to teach me lessons, don't make commitments you can't keep."
How's it going?,How guilty does she look?
Hmm. About an eight.,"That space is mine. Veni, vidi, vici."
I'm fine. Mom. Mom.,Where's Foreman?
He's down here somewhere.,Somewhere. Very helpful.
Do you have any idea when he's getting out tonight?,Sometime.
I realize you can't predict. I just thought you might be able to estimate. It's Valentine's Day. I've planned a surprise getaway.,Getaway.
Mmm-hmm.,Getaway. Get away.
She's gone to surgery.,Foreman. Your girlfriend wants to know if you're available for Valentine's. Act surprised. What are you doing down here?
Make sure that !,Take your time. What's your name?
Hannah Morgenthal.,"You have CIPA, Hannah Morgenthal."
"No, I don't.",We have to do x-rays to make sure you don't have internal injuries. Blood test to make sure no infections. An EEG for neurological anomalies and biopsy a spinal nerve.
"Whoa, whoa. Congenital Insensitivity to Pain is one of the rarest conditions on the planet. There's only been about sixty documented cases.","Yeah, and I have sEven reasons to think that she's one of them."
She says she's not.,"And that's reason number one. She knew what it was without us telling her. Two, she's still went from the snow but she's not shivering. That's odd. Unless she can't sweat or feel hot and cold."
The ambulance was warm. I want to see my mother.,"Three, scarring around the lip and tongue. When she was a baby she chewed on herself without feeling it."
I fell through a window when I was a kid.,"Four, when you cleaned the wound she flexed into the cleaner instead of away from it. It's hard to fake pain when you've nEver felt it. Takes an imaginative leap, Ms. Morgenthal. That's one of them Jew names. Ashkenazys are a higher risk group."
"On the other hand, she says she doesn't have it. And she'd be dead by now if she'd nEver been diagnosed.",They killed our Lord. Are you going to trust them? She wants to see her mom. If she admits having CIPA she knows we're not letting her go anywhere without a battery of tests.
You said you had sEven reasons.,"I pulled a number out of the air. What, five isn't enough?"
Five lame reasons aren't. I'm taking her to see her mom as!,I could hit her again if six aren't enough. Do the tests.
I could hit her again if six aren't enough. Do the tests.,Need to bail on the E.R. I got a case. Why are you wearing perfume?
Is this a real case or one of those imaginary cases that happen when you're bored?,CIPA.
CIPA is a diagnosis. Diagnoses happen at the end of cases.,She's got no idea what's going on in her body. There's gotta be something wrong.
"In other words, she could be perfectly healthy but you're curious about someone who can't feel pain because you always feel pain so you want to go exploring.","She was in a car accident. She needs x-rays, blood tests, EEG, nerve biopsy. I also note that, although the snow was coming down in sheets this morning, you left your hat at home and used ear muffs."
"Do your tests, except for the!","So, while Everyone else was just worrying about getting in, you were concerned with about ""hat head.""ï¿½ Blind dates are nEver a good idea. Only reason to wear a scarf like that is as a beacon to identify you in a crowd."
Do your tests. Except for the nerve biopsy.,I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk paralyzing her.,But it's neurological.
You have no evidence of that.,She tripped.
"Do you have any evidence other than the fact that a typically clumsy CIPA Patient tripped on an icy day? If the EEG rEveals a pRoblem, we can talk then.",You could have left the scarf at home and just told him you'd be wearing a look of desperation.
You're not going to find anything. I'm fine. I wanna see my mom.,"So, sedate her."
She won't consent.,She's a teenager.
"No dad, mom's still in surgery. What do you want us to do? Hold her down?","Well, only until you inject her with a sedative. Then you can let her go."
We tried.,Seriously?
She's strong and doesn't care. We'd have broken something before we could get her to sit still enough to inject her.,"So, break her arm. She won't mind."
You're cranky.,I'm in pain. Let's go break her arm.
I'm in pain. Let's go break her arm.,"Nurse Shortie, your biz-nitch, how long are you gonna waste her time."
I'm so glad we're walking somewhere. Another sixty feet and this conversation is over.,"When you guys are out of this program, Cameron will find somebody. Chase will find eight somebodies. And you'll be alone."
Thirty feet.,You'll date and you'll date. But you're the ultimate Darwinian. You've got to fight for Everything. Anybody else would just slow you down.
"I'm still with her, aren't I?",Yeah. I can only imagine it's because she hasn't given you an excuse to break up and you don't have the guts to recognize your own reality.
I want to see my mother.,"Hi again. I'm sure I can say this without being condescending, but then you'd get the false impression that I respect you so ""ï¿½ you're a kid, you're scared, you're stalling. Grow up."
I'm not scared. I'm nEver scared.,See? How juvenile was that? You can't feel pain. Nothing left but pleasure. Why don't you tell me how wonderful that is?
It sucks.,Better than being in pain all the time. Get in the chair.
Every morning I have to check my eyes to make sure I didn't scratch a cornea in my sleep.,"Oh God, stop. I'm in a pool of tears here."
I can't cry.,Neither can I. Every morning I check my eyes for jaundice in case the Vicodin's finally shot my liver.
I can't run anywhere without examining all my toes for swelling.,I can't run.
Boys can't hold me for too long because I can overheat.,Girls can't hold me for too long because I only pay for an hour.
I need an alarm on my watch to remind me to go to the bathroom. You know how Many humiliating experiences before I thought of that.,"The bathroom's 50 feet from my office. Every drink of water I weigh the pros and cons,"
"After Everything I do, I self-check: Mouth, tongue, gums for cuts. Count teeth, check temperature. Fingers, toes and joints for swelling, skin for bruises.",I got shot.
I sat on the stove when I was three. Want to see the coil marks?,Yeah.
You think I'm lying?,"You think I just wanna check out your tuchus, as your people would say. Put her in the chair and run the damn test. If she moves again, give her nitrous."
"You weren't shot because of leg pain, you were shot because you're a jerk.",Some think the two are connected.
She has a temperature of 105.,Wow. She's actually sick.
We've got her temperature down below boiling. Could be infection.,No. LP showed normal proteins and no white blood cells.
High billirubin. Could be a liver pRoblem.,Nope. Transaminases were normal.
Could be drugs. She's smoked pot since she was elEven.,No again. Tox screen was clean.
Maybe we did something to her. Maybe she got sick after the tests. We should rerun them.,And biopsy a spinal nerve.
You want to risk paralysis because she's got a fEver?,I want to risk paralysis because I don't know what's causing the fEver. If it's neurological!
It's a fEver.,In a CIPA Patient. Obviously things are a little different in her upstairs wiring.
And have been since the day she was born.,Yah. It's much more likely that whatEver it is was clEverly waiting and hiding until you guys were done testing.
Where are you going?,"You're all against this, right? And, you're all going to stand on principle and refuse to do it, right? I'm going to get Cuddy's approval."
"WhatEver happens, I need you to understand that there are certain aspects to my life, I'm not happy about.",I need the nerve biopsy.
And you had to come here personally to tell me that. And how did you Even know I was here?,I had to bring the file. This is the most noncommittal location within walking distance. You left your car keys on your desk. Greg House. You two must have met online. Either that or you've got a friend who secretly hates you.
"Uh, Don Herrick. Yeah, we connected through singleballroomdancelovers.com.",Why would he volunteer that information?
Why would I hide it?,"You didn't tell him that anything he said will be held against you? So, what line of work are you in?"
"Uh, auto maintenance. Changing oil and filters.","Great, my place overcharges. You can't trust anything you guys say. So, where are you loCated?"
Most CIPA complications are infection and she's got a fEver. LP? Urine?,Clean. Normal. Same with the white blood cell count.
Cancer?,"Nothing on the scan. I think it's her nerves messing with the temperature control. Amyloid, sarcoid, there's a lot of candidates. I want a biopsy."
"Fine. If that's what you need, go get it.",He seems a lot nicer than that one from Wicca needs a daddy figure dot com.
I am so tired of this. Did you know that the new nurse from cardiology is sleeping with that weird Lawyer from the board?,The guy with elEven fingers?
He has elEven fingers?,How do you not notice that?
The nurse used to be a Man.,She's not anymore?
But we can't talk about that.,I thought we were.
"We were supposed to talk about that. I came here to talk about that. But on the way up, I ran into Cameron. You've got a CIPA Patient.",Mmmm. Tranny nurse is more interesting.
"Oh it's way more interesting. But instead, I've got to be your damn conscience. I'm tired of being your conscience. I don't enjoy being your conscience.",No one enjoysï¿½
You're studying her....,She's actually sick.
Which you found out after you took her on.,"I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous."
"I don't think that metaphor was designed to actually warn cats. You don't care about her illness, you care about CIPA. Which means your focus is going to be on getting your answer, not hers.",Thank you. Forewarned is forearmed.
What do you think you're going to figure out? You think her lack of pain is somehow the answer to your pain.,I think if you'd stop talking to Cameron then right now we could be ranking nurses in order of doability.
Need you.,What did the nerve biopsy show?
NEver did it.,"Well then, do it."
Can't.,Why?
She's going to jump off the lobby balcony.,And you think I can catch her?
Not yet.,This is excellent.
The paranoia seems to have dissipated but her vitals keep getting worse. She could be dead in hours.,"But if you're going to die a miserable, lingering death, pain free is the way to do it. Are we sure the fall didn't cause the paralysis?"
The paralysis caused the fall. Spine's clean. No veritable fractures or spinal cord compression.,Even better. The nuttiness and paralysis means there's definitely a neurological component.
Could be a nerve disease.,Which is why we need to look at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.
There are other tests!,"HIV? Syphilis? She was negative for all STDs. Vascular? No, ANA was negative. Cerebral clot? No, MRI was!"
Makes sense given her glucose reation was slow and her potassium is down.,Yeah. I'll check with an endocrinologist.
Bennett's on call.,Perfect.
Nooooo.,Need a consult.
I already okayed your nerve biopsy.,I need an endocrinologist.
Bennett's on call.,Won't pick up. His cell phone must be broken.
Mine's working.,Had to give you the file.
I assume you're thinking thyroid storm. You done a hormone panel?,Normal. TSH was on the low side. Is that a cheery fire I hear crackling nearby?
No. What about CPK enzymes?,"Elevated. 275. Of course, people light fires for themselves. But then they don't deny it. He's here."
CPK isn't high enough. Potassium's what you'd expect because of the bronchodilators.,Oh my God. You're not wearing a bra.
It's not thyroid storm.,You just met him.
I like him. And I like sex. Do I need to stitch a letter on my tops?,No. But it might be worth taking out an ad in the local papers.
"Do you like me, House? I was on the phone with Bennett 15 minutes ago. His cell phone's working. You're M.O is to avoid me at all costs. And suddenly you need my input on Every move you make. I can only assume it's because I'm on a date.","When we met, I noticed!"
"You noticed he was a Shriner because of the way he parted his hair. You noticed he was a momma's boy because of the way he blinked his left eye. I'm not interested. I'm not impressed. There are only two reasons anyone would want to screw with me tonight. Either they're an altruistic, decent person who's worried about my well being. Or, they want me for themself.",You left out the third option. Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people's happiness.
Where did you go? She's getting worse.,It's not thyroid storm. Get me a spinal nerve.
There are still other tests.,She just said the girl's getting worse. You really want to wait?
We'll be risking infection. Maybe make the paralysis worse.,It is worse. We're making it worse than worse? Do the biopsy.
You could paralyze her and get no useful information.,Do the biopsy.
You're thinking peripheral neuropathy. We should take a nerve a little further away from the spine.,A little further from the truth. We're talking paralysis. Good chance the spine is relevant. This thing is progressing. It could kill her in hours. Give me back my papers.
"Give us a minute? Did you know they recently found a protein that speeds up nerve growth? Fascinating stuff. If you put that protein with the insulation from a spinal nerve, you could grow your own little garden. If that spinal nerve!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If it happened to come from a person with CIPA I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg. What an evil plan."
You'd have to be on immunosupressors for life. Risk of infection. Shorter life span!,"Shorter, but normal."
Usually jealousy expresses itself by trying to destroy what someone has. You're more ambitious. You actually want to change medical fact to get this thing you!,Medical fact changes all the time.
You're risking your Patient's life.,That's how medical fact changes. A doctor risks!
"To serve their Patient health, not their own.",This is medically justified.
Are you sure? Are you sure that you're the right one to be making this call.,"Biopsy whatEver nerve you figure you can safely get at. God, Wilson's annoying."
Means damage must be coming from the outside in.,Which means it's secondary demyelination. Which means the source is somewhere else. Which tells us it's not a nerve disease means it's something systemic that's affecting the nerves. Which mean we need to! Where are you going?
Kid's mom is finally out of surgery,I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.,So what?
Hannah should see her.,"Yes, immediately after we're done chatting about saving her life. Most likely causes are metabolic."
They found brain swelling. They're prepping her mother for another surgery.,"Again, so what? Get a nurse to take the kid. There are more than sixty different metabolic conditions that could account for what she's got. There are only three of you guys."
She's scared.,She should be. She'll die if we don't diagnose her.
I can't cry. Oh. My head's killing me.,"So, what does the pain tell us?"
"It tells us nothing. It wasn't physical pain, it was emotional.",Exactly. What were they doing when she got the headache?
Saying goodbye.,You said they were arguing.
They weren't really arguing. She was just frustrated.,What were they arguing about?
Whose fault it was.,"Peripheral neuropathy, fEver and intermittent paranoia. Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things. But what if we add guilt?"
Guilt as a symptom?,Alzheimer's can cause euphoria. Pain causes depression. And B12 deficiency causes guilt along with all that other stuff.
"This is pointless. If the headache was caused by the illness, it means she has a B12 deficiency. If it's just because she was sad, it's meaningless. How the hell do we test for that?","We don't. Give her a shot of B12. If she gets better, I was right."
"We already did. The E.R. gave her B12 when she was admitted, part of a multivitamin supplement. Apparently she's just sad.",Why are you still here?
Trying to get a couple of Patients into a drug trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow. Why are you here?,I still haven't figured out why.
"No, I meant here. In my office.",Just dumped a cool B12 theory. Moved on to leukemia.
Very pedestrian.,I'm not happy. Her white blood cell count was low. But the ones she's got! Just a whole lot of eosinophils.
"The immunoglobulin E lEvel's borderline. If you want to be one hundred percent sure, check the bone marrow.","Team's doing a biopsy right now. So it turns out, the weird Lawyer knew that she used to be a Man."
And he's cool with that?,Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a Man.
"Ho, ho.",Yeah.
It's so you don't move during the procedure.,"Is that nitrous? What are you, trying to kill her? You gave her nitrous during the EEG. That's what made this thing rear it's ugly head."
What thing?,B12 deficiency.
Are you having dï¿½jÃ vu? We've had this conversation. She was given B12. She didn't get better.,Because someone else ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.
What? What are you doing? Don't touch me. Don't touch me.,See. There she goes. Another paranoid delusion. She's going downhill. Forget the MRI. We need an O.R.
Occupied.,Her hernia can wait.
Help. They're trying to kill me.,Okay. You can either beliEve that we really are trying to kill her! or you can assume that she's suffering from a medical condition. Seeing as this is a hospital and we're all dressed like doctors and there are easier ways to kill somebody!
"Bev, help them.","I'm going to need iodine, scalpel numbers 10 and 15, forceps and a largish salad bowl. Okay. Hold her down. Come on, weenies, she's in a cast. Swab. Fifteen."
You're not going to anesthetize her?,"Relax. It's just a magic trick. She's faking it. We're not falling for it this time. Okay, keep that retracted. Forceps. Lake fishing can be fun. It can bring the generations together. If you don't cook that trout or perch well, you'll be giving room and board to this fellow. By free board, I mean all the B12 you can take in."
I could have a tapeworm in me?,Not likely. You'd be in a lot of pain.
It's gotta be twenty five feet long.,Damn. World record's over sixty.
You could ask her for the spinal nerve.,She's got no reason to give it.
She owes you.,The hospital will send her a bill.
"I'm just saying, if you wanna do it, do it while her B12 is still low. Guilt can be your friend. Breakfast?",Yeah.
I'm going back to bed.,Where you going?
"There is no case, House. Even if dystonia was some big medical mystery, it's not this time.","You're not intrigued as to how a perfectly healthy ten-year-old boy, with no prior musical training, gets into an accident on his way to school..."
"You're not intrigued as to how a perfectly healthy ten-year-old boy, with no prior musical training, gets into an accident on his way to school...",...and suddenly starts playing piano?
Do we have to start a twenty-five-year-old case before breakfast?,You two shower together?
No.,Double negative. It's a yes.
Savantism is just one of those things. It's... inexplicable.,"Just because it's ""inexplicted"", doesn't mean it's inexplicable. I want new labs. CBC with platelets, chem panel, thyroid and adrenal function tests."
For what?,I don't know.
"There was construction on Radcliffe, so I had to get out of the car and-and walk in high-heels for over a mile.",Radcliffe? What was the cross street?
Does it matter?,I don't know. You're the one who brought it up. Tie this off.
I don't know. You're the one who brought it up. Tie this off.,Nice and tight.
Does this have anything to do with my foot?,You have a blister. You don't waste a doctor's time with a blister. Waste a doctor's time with more important things like the sewer that's beng vented out of your mouth.
My breath?,"If you could stop doing that, we'd all be grateful."
I can't stop breathing.,Nope! But you can stop puking.
I don't...!,"Your lips say no, your gnarly fingers say --"
He's good to go.,It's a shame. You look cute that thin.
Motor cortex looks good. Everything checks out.,What tests did you run?
Full battery of neurological...,I need this blood checked for cholesterol and glucose lEvels.
Patient had a foot pRoblem.,Different Patient.
There's no one else in here.,You're using the wrong equipment.
"Dr. Foreman, I thought we were being discharged.","I'm Dr. House. On the off-chance that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it, I have something of a gift too. C'mon."
"I'm Dr. House. On the off-chance that Dr. Foreman didn't mention it, I have something of a gift too. C'mon.",Your turn.
Does this have anything to do with his hand?,"It might. Okay, Patrick. Close your eyes."
"It might. Okay, Patrick. Close your eyes.",What's this?
"D, G-flat, A-flat, B...","Yeah, all right, all right."
He's good. Can we let him go?,He's great. He's staying.
He's great. He's staying.,Call radiology. I need a Functional MRI of his brain.
FMRI's not gonna show trauma.,I'm not looking for trauma. I wanna see the music.
The music.,"Well, that's dull."
"Think fMRI's gonna show a big arrow pointing to a flashing sign saying ""Savantism""?",Would be hugely helpful. Somehow he got rewired as a music specialist. I wanna know how that happens.
He had access to parts of his brain that you don't.,His brains doing nothing. Looks like any jerk listening.
He's not savant at listening. He's a savant at playing. Both listening and playing are different neurological processes.,Turn off the music.
Turn off the music.,"Patrick, I want you to pretend that your leg is a piano."
But it's not a piano.,"I know. That's why I said ""pretend"". Kid's a moron. Keep your head still, use your fingers."
Wha...?!,"Cool, huh? His heart rate rose."
Emotional response?,Then why is there no activity in the limbic system? Unless there's a pRoblem in his heart. Do an echo to confirm. And scrub up. He's gonna need surgery.
But no vasoconstriction. The heart pRoblem couldn't have caused the hand pRoblem.,"Unless the bleed happened suddenly. Less blood to the brain explains dystonia. Less blood to the heart explains the heart attack. Scope him both above and below. If that doesn't work, gut him."
Pretty.,I wrote this when I was in junior high school. Could nEver figure out what came next. And Dimwit came up with this.
It's good.,It's perfect.
I could set up a tower on the roof during a lightning storm. Help you switch brains with your Patient. Then you would be the brilliant pianist and he would be the doctor hiding brain cancer from his friend.,It's nothing.
You need to talk about it.,You need to talk about it.
"At least, let me look at your medical file.",You're making a big deal out of nothing. Who else knows?
No one. And cancer isn't nothing.,"Sorry, didn't mean to offend your specialty."
Why didn't you come to me?,Stein's good.
Stein's in Africa for the next six months.,"He's given me at least six months. Go to Boston, get the treatment. Everything will be fine. No need to talk about it."
"And while they were closing him up, Patrick had a grand mal seizure... which makes no sense, since he's on an anti-convulsive medication.",You told him.
I... only told Cameron.,Hey! Okay. You guys have clEverly deduced that I have cancer. You have no right to know. You have no business knowing.
We'd like to run some blood tests...,"As soon as you work up our Patient, who is not me."
Just wanna make sure you weren't misdiagnosed.,I wasn't. Let's move on.
We're just asking for a couple of vials.,No!
Why not?,"Okay, we're going to proceed as if I'm perfectly healthy."
How can we do that if we know you're not?,"You don't know anything! Except, hopefully, our Patient on anti-convulsive medication has a seizure."
"Anti-seizure meds don't prEvent seizures, they just make them Manageable.","According to the surgeon's report, this one wasn't Even close to Manageable."
"Means the question isn't why is he having seizures, it's why are his seizures getting worse?",What's changed?
"His brain, it's gotten worse.",Why don't we make it Even worser?
Why don't we make it Even worser?,We take him off anti-convulsive medication.
He'll seize Even more. Multiple seizures can seriously damage a brain.,Dude can't button a shirt. How much more damage are we really talking about?
"Strongest seizures will light up different parts of the brain, which will indiCate response to damage.","Once he gets worse, do a PET scan."
"Once he gets worse, do a PET scan.",PET scan done?
No.,You come for my feelings?
You come for my feelings?,'Cause I left them in my other pants.
This is a letter of recommendation. I'm applying for a job at Penn.,Thank you for writing your own. Sure my thoughts are beautifully phrased.
Thank you for signing it. Saves me from having to fake your signature.,Stay away from Weiss. He cries with his Patients. Holds their hands as they die. He won't like you.
Stay away from Weiss. He cries with his Patients. Holds their hands as they die. He won't like you.,Your new-found nonchalance in the face of cancer.
I thought you'd find it appealing.,Twenty seconds. Pretty good.
For what?,Time it took you to go from hard-ass to huMan being.
Time it took you to go from hard-ass to huMan being.,You really wanna leave?
"If you're not here, there's not much point of staying.",I'm not dead yet.
I'm not dead yet.,What're you doing?
What're you doing?,I know this must be a turn-on for you.
I know this must be a turn-on for you.,A little whorish to kiss and stab.
You kissed back.,"I didn't want you to die without knowing the feeling. Actually, no Woman should die without knowing the feeling."
All I need is a few drops of your blood.,"Foreman and Chase's lips are not gonna get to close, now that I know your plan."
There's a nurse downstairs about to risk his job to steal the blood you drew from yourself yesterday.,"I'm Patient Number Oh-Two-Oh-Four-Oh-Six, in the Record Room, under the name Luke N. Laura! There's a whole file of blood there, along with CT scans, MRIs, CSF, Everything you need."
"I'm Patient Number Oh-Two-Oh-Four-Oh-Six, in the Record Room, under the name Luke N. Laura! There's a whole file of blood there, along with CT scans, MRIs, CSF, Everything you need.","You need a sperm sample, come back without the needle."
He doesn't seem depressed.,"Hah! Okay, let's assume that I am dying. Which I specifically told you not to assume -- . Can we at least assume that I'm not dying tomorrow? Whereas this kid..."
"Hah! Okay, let's assume that I am dying. Which I specifically told you not to assume -- . Can we at least assume that I'm not dying tomorrow? Whereas this kid...",PET rEveals sEveral more hotspots. But they're non-specific...
How can you focus on him?,'S the only way I can cope. PET also showed the left brain is working hard...
Harder than the right?,Wouldn't be worth mentioning otherwise.
"Bleeding in the brain. Blood would irritate the lining, might cause the seizures to get worse.",Yes! He needs an angiogram to look at the vasculature inside his brain.
We'll get right on it as soon as we're finished here.,Don't get up. I got it. You're busy. Continue.
Don't get up. I got it. You're busy. Continue.,You know what my team is doing right now?
No.,Trying to figure what's wrong with me.
What's wrong with you?,Thanks for asking. They found out that I'm dying.
That's sad.,Everyone's dying.
That's sad.,"Meteor lands on my head tomorrow, it's all academic. I told them to leave me alone. But did they?"
Did they?,"No, that one was rhetorical."
Oh.,"No, they did not."
"No, they did not.",Who the hell were you before you hit your head?
"""Hell"" is a bad word.","So is ""ass"", ""bitch""."
"So is ""ass"", ""bitch"".","I can pRobably rattle off fifty much more compliCated disgusting ones, but then your dad would get pissed at me."
"I can pRobably rattle off fifty much more compliCated disgusting ones, but then your dad would get pissed at me.",Like your life?
What life?,Your life. Like the piano? Going on tours. Scoring girls left and right.
I don't like girls.,Boys. WhatEver gets you off.
"Dr. Peter Hayes, this is Foreman at Princeton-Plainsborough. You were doing the signal transduction-inhibitor clinical trial. What kind of results did you...?",Transduction-inhibitors are a decade away.
Transduction-inhibitors are a decade away.,"Hi, Pete!"
Got another trial going on at Duke. Fifteen percent extend their lives beyond five years. If you're positive for Protein PHF...,Stop... trying to save me. I'm fine. MRA confirms smalls collections of blood throughout the white matter of Patrick's right hemisphere. Mind if we chat about that for a few moments?
"Either trauma, an aneurysm, cancer or autoimmune disease.",We need a biopsy to figure out which it is.
EEG was non-specific. Where you gonna biopsy?,Everywhere!
"Sssure. Just put on a blindfold and play ""Pin-The-Tail-On-The-Brain"".",He's bleeding into his brain. He's dying.
You can't just randomly stab the temporal lobe and hope to hit the right spot.,I'm only gonna take little tiny pieces.
'Til what?,'Til I find the pRoblem.
Or you kill him.,"No, I'll keep going Even if I kill him. Then he's screwed. Thanks for the chat."
What if... we do the EEG from inside his brain?,I'm actually little insulted. You were supposed to spend the last hour worried about me.
It's risky and invasive.,But that's why God invented the long consent form. Can you get to why this is a brilliant idea?
"External EEG could get confused if there are multiple structural abnormalities. If we perform the EEG inside the skull, it could show us where to biopsy.",Brilliant. Go. Do.
I'd also like to talk to you about...,"This is gonna get personal, isn't it?"
Hey.,Where do we cut?
We don't. I need to say something.,Something personal?
Yeah.,And I can't leave because you got something interesting in that file.
"You're an arrogant ass..., who makes it impossible for anyone to like him, by punParkng people who don't deserve...","Can we get to the ""but"" part of this speech?"
But I like you.,"No, you don't. You're just reacting to the perception of my death. You need to put things in order. Fear of guilt..."
Will you shut up?,See? I annoy you. Now are you gonna give me the results or are we gonna...
Inter-cranial EEG showed no electrical abnormalities.,Which means it's autoimmune.
No. Also showed his entire right hemisphere is brain-dead.,"So, while you guys were worried about me, half of this kid's brain died. The only solace you should take from this is the fact that... it didn't. Garden-variety EEG sucks compared to the in-brain variety, which is not gonna miss brain death."
He's gotten worse.,Not that much worse.
"Respiration is depressed. Seizures are increasing, one Every five minutes.","Not that much worse. He can still talk. He's left-handed, which means his speech is in the right side."
You don't know how Patrick's brain reorganized itself twenty-five years ago?,What if the right side... is just a little dead. Maybe he has random neurons firing.
You're just looking for a puzzle to distract you from your own situation.,You're right. He's dead. Let's go home.
I'm so sor...,Yes!
He's obviously lost the use of his...,Shut up.
Shut up.,Music is a global process. Can't play the piano with half a brain.
What's it mean?,Means the right side of his brain has always sucked. Means it's not relevant what's going on now.
"Wow, then it's autoimmune.","Yeah! Question is, what do we do about it?"
"'S likely ones we can fix. Polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu or sarcoid. I'll start treatment.","Not what I was talking about. But yeah, you do that."
"Not what I was talking about. But yeah, you do that.",Your turn?
Do you have to do that?,"You mean, cheapen Everyone's attempt at a huMan moment by identifying the real calculations that go into it?"
Yeeah.,Yeah! I do.
Anything to say?,"Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything..."
"Well, if you're considering grabbing my ass, don't start anything...",... you can't finish.
... you can't finish.,"As long as we're just standing here, you mind if we work? How's the kid's treatment going?"
"As long as we're just standing here, you mind if we work? How's the kid's treatment going?",Are you crying?
No. Respiration rate's up. Seizures are coming down. 'S all good.,Not for what I'm gonna do next.
But there is no next. He's gonna be fine.,Only if he wants to remain a four-year-old who wets his bed.
There's nothing else for him.,There's better. Thanks for the hug.
It's the middle of the night. You know I'd be asleep.,Phone would have woken you up just as much. I can see what you're wearing on the phone.
Phone would have woken you up just as much. I can see what you're wearing on the phone.,My Patient with the fifty-five IQ has Takayasu syndrome. Very uncommon. Happens mostly in Asian women.
"Takayasu is Manageable with steroids, which you already know. So, I assume you're here for something else.",My Patient also has a significant seizure pRoblem.
Also Manageable with anticonvulsive medication.,"Yes. He kept taking his anticonvulsive medication, he could go back on tour and play the piano."
"Yes. He kept taking his anticonvulsive medication, he could go back on tour and play the piano.",But... a hemispherectomy would completely stop the right-brain seizure activity and he would no longer need to take his anticonvulsive medication.
You want to remove half his brain?,The right half. It'd be irresponsible to remove the left.
You don't remove half a brain and gain function.,"Not my brain. But his, who knows? What? Lets say I'm the left side of Patrick's brain, I'm quick- witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking."
"Not my brain. But his, who knows? What? Lets say I'm the left side of Patrick's brain, I'm quick- witted, I'm charming, I'm great looking.","You're the right side of his brain. You're useless, old, damaged."
"You're the right side of his brain. You're useless, old, damaged.","We go to a bar for a drink. Now, I have the mad skills to be scoring all the hot babes, but instead, I'm spending my time wiping drool off your Parkn and making sure you don't eat the tablecloth."
What's the father wanna do?,I don't know.
"House, I'm so sorry.","Forgot I was dying, huh?"
"I'm here, if you need me.",I need you.
I need you.,One small feel for Man. One giant ass for Mankind.
Dr. Foreman was just here. Seizures have almost completely gone away. Says we might be able to go home in the next day or two. Thank you... so much.,I think we should we should remove the right side of your son's brain.
I thought you fixed him.,"Does he look fixed? Right side of his brain is keeping him walking straight. Other than that, it's been dead-weight Ever since the accident. 'F we remove it, seizures would stop completely."
The seizures are hardly noticeable. They don't bother Patrick.,"But without the seizures, the left side would have a chance to actually function. He'll learn to do new things. Only bummer, he'll nEver play the piano again."
No. The piano's Everything.,"I'm not saying he'd Ever work for NASA, but flipping burgers isn't out of the question."
"I don't mind taking care of him, so he can play the piano.","No, you're actually lucky. You don't have to watch your kid grow up, you don't have to let go."
You trying to make this about me? I love my son! Just the way he is!,He's a monkey-grinder at the circus.
He's worked hard to get where he is!,So has the monkey. The piano is a neurological accident.
It's a gift.,And I'm offering him a life.
And I'm offering him a life.,It's up to you.
House! Open up! Open up! It's important!,I got a flight in three hours.
You don't have cancer. There was an abnormal presence of IgC and IgM indicating...,I don't have neurosyphilis. My MRI showed nothing...
"It's a gumma in your brain. It's very rare not to be in the liver and I'm really glad we nEver slept together, but...",We would have used a condom and I don't have syphilis. My VDRL was negative...
We did an FDA antibody test. The VDRL was a false negative. You're not going to die! All you need is IV antibiotics!,Did you send these results to Mass General?
Of course.,You... idiots.
You knew it wasn't cancer?,I was sure it was cancer.
Then why aren't you celebrating?,Because... it wasn't my damn file!
You faked cancer?,"The real Patient is in the Witherspoon Wing. Feel free to tell his wife he's not gonna die, but he is cheating on her."
Why would you want us to think you...?,"I didn't!! I wanted the guys at Boston to think that I had cancer. I wanted the guys, who were gonna implant a cool drug right into pleasure centre of my brain, to think that I had cancer!"
You faked cancer to get high?,I'm going to bed.
You're right! I don't like you!,Sure. Now that I'm not dying.
Heard Patrick's hemispherectomy went well.,"He survived the surgery. He's unconscious, but..."
How depressed are you?!,I'm not depressed.
You faked... cancer.,It was an outPatient procedure. I was curious.
Are you curious about heroin?,"Not since last year's Christmas party. Whoof! I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?"
You made people think that you were going to die!,I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.
I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?"
It's ironic.,"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why...?"
"Depression in cancer Patients. 'S not as common as you think. It's not the dying that gets to people. It's the dying alone. The Patients with family, with friends... they tend to do okay. You don't have cancer. You do have people who give a damn. So what do you do? You fake the cancer, then push the people who care away.",Because... they're boring. Go home to your hotel room and laugh at that irony.
"Start small, House. Take a chance. Maybe something that doesn't involve sticking stuff in your brain. Pizza with a friend. A movie. Something.",Follow my finger.
Follow my finger.,You know your name?
You know your name?,Speech centre was on the right side. It'll be a while before he's talking.
He hasn't really done anything except that... stare off into the distance.,It'll take some time to...
You buttoned your shirt?,Looks happy.
"Up and at em, you're supposed to be in clinic duty.","Yeah, like I could sleep down there with all the crying and coughing."
Here. Ex-Marine. Thinks he has gulf war syndrome.,There's no such thing.
"So he's been told, it hasn't stopped the unexplained fatigue, rashes and joint pain. And just so you know, he's the nephew of a benefactor I owe a favour, so you're going to take this case whether you like it or not.","Why wouldn't I want to take the case? The guy's tired and sore, it's going to be chapter one in my..."
You know him?,NEver met him before in my life.
That's amazing.,No it's not.
It's not?,"I can play the harmonica with my nose, make a penny come out of a Parkld's ear, or any other orifice for that matter; under the right circumstances I could bring two women into simultaneous ecstasy."
The right circumstance being their agreement to bill you on the same credit card.,What I absolutely cannot do is dream about someone I've nEver seen before.
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.,"True, it can't happen because it can't happen!"
Well maybe you didn't dream about this guy specifically.,"Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him."
"No, you imagined some generic Marine then you placed his face in the dream after you saw the picture. Sort of a coincidence mixed with a little dï¿½jÃ vu.",There's no record of him Ever coming into the clinic so I must have seen him before somewhere else.
"Fine, you've known him since cub scouts. The more interesting question isn't what you dreamed but why? I'm guessing you're longing for either a renewed relationship with your dad or a new relationship with one of the Village People.",He was in the Navy not the Marines.
I thought your dad was in the Marines?,The guy in the Village People.
"Actually he's only in the Navy when they sang, In The Navy. The rest of the time he's just in generic fatigues. What? You brought it up! You didn't flush.",I didn't pee.
I didn't pee.,"Male, 34, just got out of the Marines after 2 years in Iraq. Admitted complaining of chronic fatigue, joint pains, intermittent rashes and sore throats. Thinks he has gulf war syndrome."
Why is he here instead of the VA?,Because he has a rich uncle that Cuddy is trying to avoid fellating and doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis of Nothing's-wrong-atosis.
That's it? You beliEve her but not me?,Stick to your guns Chase. Just because there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Could just affect Everyone differently.
You think this guy has Gulf War Syndrome?,Course not. He's depressed and he's looking for a disability check. Most likely because he's just realised that knowing how to barter for sex in six languages and open a beer bottle with your eye socket are not the most marketable skills.
Why'd you take this case?,Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.
Cuddy's making him.,"Now I'm making you. Do a full physical and recheck his blood for HIV, Hep C, Malaria, SParkstosomiasis and T strain A. bauMannii just to make sure the VA's dotted their i's and find out Every hospital and clinic he's Ever visited, Every city he's Ever lived in and... whether he's Ever been on TV."
TV?,"The pRoblem could be neurological, Everyone knows TV rots your brain."
What did you go to medical school in France? There's no trace of uranium in his urine. He was given the vaccines and meds 2 years ago without any allergic or adverse reactions.,Has he Ever done any modelling?
If the lEvels are too low for us to detect they're way too low to cause any damage. Where you going?,This way. Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?
Do you really care or are you just trying to waste hospital resources to get back at Cuddy for making you take the case?,"Of course I care, what a horrible thing to say. Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy of his credit report."
Before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?,I say before. And I say in between give him a polysomnogram. Sleep apnea could cause chronic fatigue and paranoia. Find out where he went to summer camp.
Are you ok?,Yea just a little too much coffee this morning.
Were we... walking you to the bathroom?,I wish. Wilson was just in there. These guys know what I'm talking about.
Alright. Suit yourself.,Damn it.
Good question.,What?
"You were wrong about the nothing's-wrong-atosis, you can fake fatigue and joint pain but you can't fake bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.",Where's his mouth been?
Says he hasn't performed oral sex on anyone for over a year.,Selfish bastard.
Because he hasn't been with anyone since his last girlfriend dumped him after he deployed to Iraq the second time.,Selfish bitch.
"No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.",Who was his last girlfriend?
"Yea we'll get right on that. Chronic fatigue, joint pain and opportunistic infection spells cancer, pRobably lymphoma. We should biopsy his tonsillar and subMandibular lymph nodes","Right about cancer, wrong about lymphoma. Unless you're simply hiding the fact that his lymph nodes are swollen. Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary glands. He's got parotid cancer, and see if you can get to the truth about who he's been dating, there's no way a Marine goes a year without getting some blood on his bayonet."
It's not an STD you just said...,Just do it.
Biopsy's inconclusive. I'm going to do a sialogram while we wait for the results from the additional blood work.,No hurry. PRobably nothing we can do at this point anyway.
Well if the cancer hasn't spread.,He's spitting stink. You should focus on the living. I need a prescription.
I just wrote you a prescription.,"For Vicodin, I need alfuzosin."
No you don't. You figured out where you met your Marine?,"What? Oh that, I haven't really thought about it. I can't pee."
You can't remember him can you?,I can't pee.
So stop taking the Vicodin.,I want to pee and not be in pain.
Why don't you go to sleep?,I don't pee when I'm asleep.
Maybe you'll dream about him again and maybe he'll give you an address.,I haven't peed in three days.
I read that REM sleep is the brain's way of working out pRoblems.,"Very useful, did you hear what I just said?"
Yea you lied because you want to avoid talking about your obsession.,I'm not obsessing.
Why don't you just ask him?,I haven't peed in three days!
You'd be dead.,I'm not counting intermittent drips.
You'd be in agony.,I passed agony yesterday around 4.
"I think the pill is the way to go, we haven't had a condom break yet thank god, but it's bound to happen. Especially the way we've been doing it.",On a bed of nails?
No he's not kinky. He's just insatiable. I can barely make it to any of my morning classes.,You smoke?
No way.,Stop it!
Sorry.,Any history of hypertension? Blood clots? Strokes?
Nope. Besides my OCD I'm fit as a fiddle.,You have OCD.
Duh. Can't you tell?,Any other compulsions besides drinking massive amounts of water?
No. That's it thank god. My therapist says it could be a lot worse.,You get up in the middle of the night to drink?
"Yeah, Every couple of hours.",Then your therapist is an idiot. Unconscious people don't have OCD. They can howEver have diabetes insipidus.
That's impossible. I eat candy all the time.,Different kind of diabetes. This kind is cause by a banged up pituitary. You're obviously more of a lover than a fighter I'm guessing either a car accident or... you cracked your skull on the balance beam.
How'd you know?,"Easy, nice ass, no boobs, you got palms like a longshoreMan. Wait here, you need a CAT scan."
Oh my god.,"Don't worry, just means you'll be taking two hormone supplements instead of one."
Still no... relief?,I got relief. I just got no pee.
If the pills didn't work you may need a catheter.,"You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee, what's going on?"
"He's got cancer all right, but it's not in his salivary glands, it's in his brain. And it's bad, at least 6 tumours, maybe more. He lost his hearing, his sight's pRobably next.",Death is pRobably next.
Death is pRobably next.,No way he could've grown all these in a week.
"Maybe they didn't miss them, just mixed them up. Switched his films with another Patient's by mistake.","Maybe, but it means some poor sap's getting his melon sliced in the VA for no reason."
This poor sergeant is going to be dead by the end of the week.,Where have you two been?
"Lunch. Why, what happened?","Wilson's found some fast growing, illusive, or magic brain tumours. What did you find?"
You have them researParkng your dream?,Nope. I have them researParkng my Patient.
"This poor guy's brain is riddled with tumours and you're checking his credit report? C'mon, I need you guys.",Where you going?
To do my job.,He's not your Patient.
How is he?,He's dead.
Oh god.,Least he will be in a few days. Question is why? The only explanation is that the VA hospital screwed up.
There was definitely no mix up I had them recheck.,"Yes, why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake? Might've caused the death of a guy they've been trying to kill for the last two years anyway."
They didn't lie Did you just take two Vicodin?,"No, it was an antidepressant, I was told to take two Every time you walked into the room."
The VA scan of his brain. No tumours.,Yes this has proved positive that someone didn't have tumours in his brain.
You paged us?,Why didn't you send his urine to Leicester like I told you?
Because you told me not to.,Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?
You think depleted uranium might have something to do with his tumours?,Radiation's the only thing that will make tumours grow that fast.
High doses of radiation. Even if he ate depleted uranium bullets for breakfast he still would have been exposed to less radiation than we've given him in the last two days.,"Do it anyway. And you, call his uncle back, find out if he Ever brought his nephew to any hospital parties or fundraisers."
No. Not until you give me a reason.,Because... I'm your boss.
A rational reason. Or at least admit that you don't have one.,I've got a full bladder and I'm not afraid to use it.
But you are apparently afraid of discovering something that you can't rationally explain...,SHUT UP! Do what you're told. Cuddy and Wilson may not have to listen to me but you do.
6 tumours don't just disappear.,Unless they were nEver there to begin with.
The VA didn't screw up.,Maybe someone else did. Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.
Something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?,Then they were nEver tumours to begin with.
I told you I saw...,No you saw something that looked like tumours. We all did. We were all wrong. Well maybe he doesn't have cancer maybe he has a brain infection that's causing multiple abscesses.
That miraculously healed?,"No, they were healed by the antibiotics we're giving him for the vaginosis in his mouth."
If it's an infection why didn't it show up in his blood work?,I don't know. Yet.
It's not the anaesthesia.,"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?"
"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?","Chronic fatigue, sore throats, rashes, putrid discharge of the mouth, multiple abscesses in the brain, hearing loss and last but not least lower limb paralysis. He's certainly given us plenty of clues."
It's got to be some sort of infection.,That's miraculously improving in his brain but getting worse in his ears and legs?
Could be an infection and cancer. Neoplastic syndrome could depress his immune system and cause the other symptoms.,"Mm-hmm. You're basing this theory on the negative biopsy, the lymph nodes that aren't swollen or the tumours that were nEver there to begin with?"
I was right. He's excreting depleted uranium in his urine. We should start him on an IV infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonates.,It's not depleted uranium.
You're the one...,"Who asked for the test when we were thinking cancer, we no longer are."
Depleted uranium doesn't just cause cells to mutate it can cause cell death as well.,Not spinal cord cells. At least not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.
So you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant?,"The sun is radioactive, the earth is radioactive, this hospital is filled with radiation. The issue is not where it is but how much there is, and what damage that amount could cause inside someone's spinal cord, as I've already stated quite clearly..."
"Got it, we're all idiots, what's your theory?",Give me your keys.
Why?,"You Ever tried riding a motorcycle with a distended bladder? Keep him on antibiotics, check his hearing and paralysis Every hour."
So you basically want us to do nothing?,No... I basically want to do nothing. I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis Every hour.
"Wait, you can't go home now.",Actually I have to go home now. It's two days past my bedtime.
House he needs your help.,And I need sleep. Hey it's the brain's way of working out pRoblems that the conscious mind can't solve during the day remember?
No. Not yet.,"So, where were we?"
You have a nice night?,No.
The paralysis is ascending. Last check it was nearly to his diaphragm.,Tells us something.
Means it's getting worse.,Worse is something.
Actually it tells us it's not the uranium.,Did we think it was?
We started him on sodium bicarb to try and flush the uranium out of his system.,"Great, now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing. NEver thought it was uranium. For all we know uranium treatment is what's making him..."
Sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on...,On what? Kind of hard to say what it would have an effect on if you have no idea what's there to affect.
We had to do something.,"Well next time, go with something that has a chance of working."
Like what? Did you come up with some brilliant idea while you were warm and cosy in your bed at home?,We need more information.
How much more information could you possible want? We have a medical history going all the way back to his great grandparents. A non-medical history going...,It's not enough.
It's all we're going to get.,Want to bet?
Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?,"Don't look at me, I was home in bed."
He was only on the sodium bicarb...,He's bleeding out.
He can't be bleeding out there's no blood in the bed.,"Fine, he's bleeding in."
The paralysis must have reached his diaphragm he's not able to oxygenate his blood.,He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left.
There's no evidence...,The only thing that would explain...
There's no reason for blood loss.,"There has to be a reason, he needs a transfusion. Get me four units of O negative stat! Now let's elevate his feet."
He doesn't need a transfusion.,Nobody asked you. In fact why are you Even here?
Because obviously you need my help.,Get out.
House. His blood obviously didn't just vanish... What the hell is this?,Somebody must have spilled something. Somebody else should be getting me four units of O negative stat.
What the hell is that?,"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?"
"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?",What? It's just urine. It's sterile. No one's getting me blood! Why isn't anybody getting me blood?
House are you all right?,Why are you Even here?
I'm always here.,No you're not. There got to be a reason. There has to be.
No you're not. There got to be a reason. There has to be.,"So, where were we?"
You have a nice night?,Yes I did thank you. I'm guessing better than our Patient. PRobably due to his BP and hematocrit plunging.
How'd you know?,"The answer was staring right at us the whole time, as plain as the nose on our faces, or the nose on his face."
"What's going on, what'd he say?",No hairs and cauterisation scars.
Which means?,He had it cauterised.
How could you know that?,"Because it makes sense, undoubtedly done to stop the same Parkldhood nosebleeds that plagued his grandfather, undoubtedly because they were both born with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia."
What's he saying?,I'm saying you got a genetic disease that is destroying your capillaries.
That no one in his family has Ever been diagnosed with before?,"Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms, skin rashes and nosebleeds, are often written off as the result of minor trauma or dry weather. But they can also be the result of his arteries and veins merging together. He obviously has AVM's. An AVM near his spine caused the paralysis. AVM in his lungs prEvented his blood from being filtered. Dirty blood caused the joint pain, fatigue and the infections in his mouth and brain. Nothing that a few surgeries won't clear up. Get MR angiograms of the aforementioned. The Marines weren't hiding anything, he was, or at least he forgot to mention his bloody tissue issue."
"Oh, looks like solving the case, solved your other pRoblem.","There is no medicine like happiness, except maybe laughter, or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra."
You cathed yourself?,"It's actually not that bad after the first... I don't know, 9 or 10 inches. Cath reliEved the spasm. I'm as good as new."
"Of course, just a minor spasm in a muscle you've been using multiple times a day without any pRoblem for the past 45 years. Not a major side effect caused by the overuse of a particular narcotic painkiller.",Yeah that was my thought too.
"So, no reason to think about cutting back on your use of that particular pill.",Thank god. Actually it was a triple dose of the good stuff that allowed me to finally get some sleep and solve the case. The pills made all my dreams come true.
You really got the answer in your sleep?,"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower."
"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower.",I've been thinking about you. You lied.
"I didn't lie, I simply chose not to share completely irrelevant facts.",Like the fact that you lied. No wonder I couldn't place his face. You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.
I was not.,"Talk about the cool uncle, he donates the money while the nephew gets the write off. Of course by write off I mean he gets to put your ankles..."
This is exactly why I didn't mention our one date over two years ago.,Because of my t-shirt?
Because you are an obnoxious ass. Because you would've spent the whole time...,"That's very smart, because this way I spent my whole time completely focused on the Patient."
How did you Even remember him? We were only at that party for like 10 minutes.,What is this some new health plan? You service the Dean of Medicine and you get free health care for a year? Why are you smiling?
You remembered him because he made out with me.,"I'm good with faces. So this plan, is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?"
You're lousy with faces.,"Don't make this about me, this is your humiliation. So how much for private room coverage?"
Get over me.,Oh give me a break. You hired me...
Because you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank so I got you cheap.,You gave me Everything I asked for because one night I gave you Everything you...
"Stop staring at my ass when you think I'm not looking, showing up at restaurants where I happen to be on a date and fantasising about me in the shower. That ship sailed long ago House. Get over it.",If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.
If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,"Sorry, looking for an extra large trash can."
"S. S is speech. I'm slurring. I'm slurring? Huh. Oh! Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I'm having a stroke.",Hi. I'm Dr. House. My boss says you're important.
Oh.,"Personally I don't get what's so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty. Arms out in front of you. With your palms up, like you're holding a pizza. Close your eyes."
"It's so easy, you should consider a career change. PRobably make a lot more money.",Dr. MackMan tell you the clot was clear?
Yes.,And he said you and the fetus are fine.
Yeah.,He didn't mention your pronator drift.
What's that mean?,It means MackMan is an idiot. May I?
Yeah.,So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business.
It's not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them. My eyes okay?,Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don't look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.
This is going to happen again?,"Unless I can figure out the underlying cause. Puff up your cheeks. You should be able to keep the air in. It means there's weakness around the mouth. So, where'd you learn to self-diagnose a stroke?"
"Oh, my uh! baby's biological father is a neurologist. He once told me the FAST mnemonic could save my life one day so ""ï¿½","Interesting pet name. Most people go with ""husband""ï¿½ or ""pookie.""ï¿½"
"He's gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you ""ï¿½",You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?
Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.,"A Man after my own heart. Different magazine, obviously. I'm rescinding MackMan's discharge order. My lackeys will be in to do some more tests, take some more blood and empty your catheter bag. Not a moment you'll want to cherish."
He's caring.,Find anything else in the Patient's folder? Like a diagnosis?
Urinalysis rEvealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine lEvel over 2.5.,"So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?"
BP is fine. No preeclampsia.,Any of you guys Ever been to the Galapagos?
"Was our Patient there? Dengue fEver, avian pox. Even West Nile.",No. I'm looking for a vacation spot.
That mean we get vacation?,How would that differ from your current status?
You're going to do what? Relax?,Visiting family. My uncle's a giant turtle.
"What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around.",Kidneys don't often get stuck in the brain.
"I'm saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness.",Heart's way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.
Echo's normal. The history indiCates no sign of cardiac pRoblems.,"No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep."
In her throat. That's the one about 10 inches above the heart.,Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.
She was prescribed antibiotics.,No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated?
It leads to rheumatic fEver.,"Which leads to, Cameron?"
Mitral valve stenosis.,Which is a thickening in the valve of the!kidney? No. The kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.
We'll go look at the heart.,"It'll be easy to find. It's the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat."
Start threading the catheter.,"I don't want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario. That's why I asked for a direct flight to Phnom Penh. How hard is it to not land? Does it matter what I answer? Well then, fine, I'd be delighted to hold. What's new?"
Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?,It's her job. What's new?
You're vacationing in Cambodia? You're going to unwind in the killing fields?,Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.
Aren't those catfish critically endangered?,"That's why it's my last chance to catch one. If the mitral valve had been fixed, the kidneys should be getting better which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure."
"There are only a few possibilities. Patient's pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because ""ï¿½",Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?
"Hypoperfusion. The fetus is basically a parasite, stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.",Put her on telemetry.
"A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.",Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.
"That's it, has to be one of those five.",You know what would be Even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one.
She's 0 for 5.,Either the differential was wrong or she's faking it.
We did the labs. No one else had access.,That's not quite true.
You put all your Patients through this Many tests or just the important ones?,We wanted to explore all the possibilities.
And?,We've eliminated all the possibilities.
You're telling me I'm dying and you have no idea why?,Your body is functioning properly.
So why are my kidneys failing?,The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus.
The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus.,"Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome. Mom's body is like an intriCate GerMan metro system. All the trains run on time. When she gets pregnant, it's like a new station opening in Dusseldorf. A bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes. Kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted. Before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to Berlin and you've got a bunch of angry GerMans with nowhere to go. And we all know that ain't good for the Jews."
Who are the Jews in this metaphor?,"A few things can happen to a fetus in distress. It can become a miscarriage, stillbirth, very sick baby or, on rare occasion, a time bomb that kills mom while it's dying. The good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better. It's the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale."
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.,"Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for ""dead baby?""ï¿½ You think she'll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?"
"We can tell her the truth ""ï¿½ that she'll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.",If only there existed giant maParknes that could look through huMan skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.
"Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma ""ï¿½","All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?"
"Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein's anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen's vein ""ï¿½","And Dr. Storm Cloud rained all over the differential and killed the beautiful little baby. Heart's easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let's start there. When you did Mom's MRI did you get a look at the fetus' heart?"
It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place.,So we need another scan.
"Yeah. We'll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.",No need. I'm going to paralyze it.
You want to paralyze Emma Sloan's baby?,Let me guess. Cameron.
Cameron and Chase both had their concerns.,"No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn't want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug."
They're sleeping together?,"If by ""sleeping together""ï¿½ you mean having sex in the janitor's closet."
Here?,"No, the janitor's closet at the local high school. Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account."
I will deal with them after I deal with you.,"Oh, come on. Let's gossip some more. I'm sure she's into bondage."
"Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging ""ï¿½",Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma's life.
You're gonna need to get her consent.,That shouldn't be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.
I'm going with you.,"Oh, good."
You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.,The injection goes into the umbilical cord.
The baby won't feel a thing.,Fetus! I'm lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?
"It must be easier to hear that you might die than your baby might die. But if there's anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be Dr. House.",Fetus. Hold this.
Chase isn't the one who's gonna get hurt here.,There's only room for one. Though I could scooch over.
My social life is my social life.,"Couldn't agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's closet is nobody's business except ""ï¿½"

What are you doing?,"Well, you're trying to be me so I thought I'd try to be you."
You don't have the cleavage for it.,But I have a much tighter ass. You think Every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron? Let me see the results of the bladder tap.
They aren't back yet.,They're gonna to be inconclusive.
You think my diagnosis is wrong?,"Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom's lEvel is fine."
Doesn't mean I'm wrong. Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.,"Either way, your test will be inconclusive. The urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus' bladder for weeks. And, as my pappy always said, ""stale pee is useless pee.""ï¿½"
"Fine, then I'll do another tap.",Just as useless. Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap 'cause it's all backed up. Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee and it's when you'll find out if this fetus has Even a fighting chance.
Thank you. I'll run two more taps.,Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?
She's an important Patient.,"Because she takes pictures? Or because she's you? Woman in her forties. Single. Using a turkey baster as a last gasp of motherhood. And you want to make sure she succeeds, so you'll still have hope. Can't be a good doctor if you're not objective."
It's your file.,I don't want it.
Then why did you just say all that stuff?,To humiliate you.
You're taking the case back.,I don't want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.
Emma's jaundiced. Her liver's shutting down.,Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight.
"I thought you were climbing Mount ""ï¿½ whatEver. In Argentina.",Apparently I'd have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they'd consider me an elder. I decided to go kayaking with orca instead. No legs required.
"Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's off the charts.",Even fetuses lie. We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one. What if that's not the whole story. What if the little bugger is hiding something? Real reason for the mirror syndrome. Have we looked under its bed? Have we checked its diary?
We won't be able to get a good look until they dEvelop. It'll be weeks,She's not going to last weeks.
What do you want to do?,Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus.
It's not viable at twenty-one weeks. You'll kill the baby.,Fetus.
Do seMantics make you feel better? Pretend it's not a person?,Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her?
Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her?,The swollen bladder was not the only pRoblem. We can't leave it inside you. We have to terminate.
"Well, can't you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory maParkne until you figure out what's wrong.",We can. And it won't matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.
"Oh, well. I'll suffer through this for at least two more weeks, then.",You're on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don't make dialysis for your liver. You're not going to make it two more days.
I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.,It's killing you.
I'm not having an abortion.,"It's not a baby. It's a!tumor. I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your Parkld might live. But that's not the choice here. Either it dies or you both die."
Or you fix him and we both live.,I can't fix it. I'm scheduling a D and C.
I won't consent. So I guess you have two days to figure it out.,Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She's dEveloped sEvere DIC. You have to force her to terminate.
Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby's lung dEvelopment?,No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prEvent lung dEvelopment. I'm trying to extinguish the huMan race one fetus at a time.
"Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they're the pRoblem.",My real Patient is dying. Very quickly. Like I wouldn't advise her to buy any green bananas. The fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point. Removing it is an instant cure.
"You're not going to get Emma to see it that way. She's pRobably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him.","See, you get it. She'll listen to you."
No.,"You let this Woman refuse to terminate, you're helping her commit suicide. As her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide."
"If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.",Then she'd be an idiot.
What if our original assumption is wrong.,It isn't.
The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma's kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid.,"Wow. If the ass kisser won't agree with you, you must be Even wronger than I thought."
"Fine. Let's assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby's bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don't have to terminate.",So her theory is that our Patient's liver pRoblems were just a giant coincidence.
Thank you.,Brown-noser.
Viral hepatitis. HELLP syndrome.,Oh look. Sticking up for your girlfriend. Who says Parkvalry's dead?
He's not joking?,Be Patient. She's going through all of us. She'll get that jungle fEver Eventually.
I'm not going through anyone.,You love him?
It worked.,What worked?
"I got the baby's lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out ""ï¿½",Cab's on its way. I have to finish packing.
I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to beliEve when Everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.,Helps to know they're idiots.
Do you think I'm an idiot?,You're not objective. But you're not an idiot. His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.
But big enough for a diagnosis.,These tissue buds are new. Could indiCate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic Eventration.
I was thinking bronchogenetic cysts or bronParkal atresia.,Could be lung lesions. CCAM.
"What about ""ï¿½",Move.
I thought you started your vacation.,Somebody had to save our boss' rotundous ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.
"Small buds in the lungs could indiCate ""ï¿½","Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and ""none of the above.""ï¿½"
Fetal lungs are so tiny an MRI won't give us the details we need.,What would we do if this Patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person.
He! is a person.,"Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it's a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what's in the lungs?"
Too much radiation for a one-pound person.,"You can't just shoot Everything down, Chase. You're not me. Collaborate."
A ventilation perfusion scan would be next.,How do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope? Idiot.
"If it were really a person and we had no other options, we'd do an exploratory surgery. Cut into his chest and have a look around.",Let's do that. You're the one who insists we treat it like a person. I'll put it back when I'm done.
Let's do that. You're the one who insists we treat it like a person. I'll put it back when I'm done.,Me again. Your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter. We're going to do open fetal surgery. Open the uterus cut out the fetus so we can look around. I know you can't talk so I need you to look petrified if you consent.
The umbilical cord won't be cut. During surgery your body will basically serve as the baby's heart-lung maParkne. We find what's wrong and we fix it. If we can.,Don't lower expectations if you want them to do something.
She should know what she's facing. This is incredibly dangerous. It risks both your lives. The only reason why we're suggesting it is because there's nothing else we can do.,You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.
You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.,Mind each other's personal space. There are sharp implements in the room. Like this one. Uterus is fully exposed.
And we're in. Start draining the amniotic fluid.,Have you nEver sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg? Where'd you go to college? Gimme that.
Affix the pulse ox to the palm. House.,"Sorry. I just realized I forgot to TiVo ""Alien.""ï¿½"
"Fetal heart rate good, stats are stable.",Position him for the incision.
"All right, I see three well-defined lesions. It's definitely CCAM. I should be able to resect them.",It's the mom. She's in V-fib.
I'm clear.,Looks like asystole. Paddling's not going to do anything.
It's fine V-fib. I'm going again.,"We're going to lose them both. Clamp! The surgery's not doing this to her, the fetus is."
"Step away, House. I'm going again.",The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down.
"So my kidney, liver and lungs are all fine, just like that?",Just like that.
That's amazing.,What's amazing is how blond your baby's hair is.
My baby?,"You know, the thing in your belly that tried to kill you."
You've nEver called him a baby before.,Any pain?
Nothing I can't deal with.,"You can only get out of bed to pee, poo or shower. And absolutely no sex. So stop flirting with me."
Sorry. So this really worked. He'll be! normal?,"Um. If you call being born twice, normal."
"Hey, thank you.",Don't thank me. I would have killed the kid.
House. Need you to take a look at something.,I'm off the clock.
Just open it.,First class ticket to Vancouver Island.
Shoot. It's the wrong envelope. I think it's great.,Yeah. Who doesn't like Canadians?
"It's big. You're ""ï¿½ you're trying to have a life. You're trying to enjoy yourself.",You didn't need to apologize.
"I'm not. I told you why I'm ""ï¿½",You screwed up.
I saved a life. I saved two lives.,"You let your maternal instinct get the best of you and nearly killed two people. In a case like this you terminate and mom lives 10 times out of ten. You do what you did, mom and baby both die 9.9 times out of 10."
Sometimes point 1 is bigger than 9.9.,"No. It's smaller. Exactly 9.8 smaller. Always is, always will be."
Where's House?!,Antique vintner's cane. Cost me nine hundred dollars.
It had a corkscrew in it.,Ah! That explains the vintner's reference.
It could be used as a weapon against the pilot.,Only if he's stuck in a bottle of Zinfandel.

You gave a three-minute speech. You know how much WHO accreditation means to the hospital.,"Huh, may have been short, but it had girth!"
And the room service thing was just spiteful.,I was hungry.
Three hundred dollars for a bottle of wine.,I was thirsty.
A hundred and twenty dollars on video services.,I was lonely.
That's five hundred in expenses I can't justify.,"Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
"No, I booked two first-class tickets. This must be a mistake.",No mistake. Just arranged for a five hundred dollar fare reduction. Expense pRoblem solved.
"Here you are. Rib-eye, medium rare.",Thank you.
Some more Pinot Grigio?,"Uh, no. Think I will switch to the... Syrah!"
"Sir, are you all right?",He's drunk.
Is anyone a doctor?,Yes!
Yes!,I'll go get her.
What do you want?,Did you really think I was gonna leave you stuck back here for eighteen hours?
Did you really think I was gonna leave you stuck back here for eighteen hours?,"Go on, enjoy. With the Vicodin and the wine, I can sleep anywhere."
Not funny.,Wasn't supposed to be funny-ha-ha.
"FEver, headache, sEvere abdominal pain, and a rash all over his lower back. It's serious. May be contagious.",Wow! We just attended a symposium on pandemics and you've run right into one on the flight home. Talk about a small world.
Is someone sick?,No!
No!,Someone has a hangover. He had a snoot-load of Bloody Marys before dinner.
That booze did not give him the rash. It is textbook meningococcus.,"It is also textbook allergic reaction to... pollen... peanuts, semen-stained polyester blanket he's lying on."
What? Why do we have to turn a...?,We don't! You misunderstood. Dr. Cuddy just meant that... he might feel less nauseous if he was facing a different direction. She didn't mean to panic a planeload of people.
"We're about to head over the North Pole. We don't turn back now, the next ER's fifteen hours away.",He'll be fine. I'm a doctor too.
You haven't examined him.,"Korean male, mid-thirties, 5' 9"", one-sixty, bald, scar on the right side of his jaw, medic alert bracelet on his left wrist indicating that he is allergic to, at least, penicillin."
"Without any way to do an LP to rule out meningococcus, our only choice is to assume the worst.","Good point. On the other hand, I am a Board-certified specialist in infectious disease. She assigns Parking spaces."

"Sea bass, seafood kebabs?",He had the sea bass. Please tell me she had the kebabs.
I think so.,"Ciguatera poisoning. It's an instant onset toxin. Symptoms include ""E"", all of the above. 'S only found in certain kinds of tropical gamefish, such as...?"

Meningococcus makes just as much sense.,I know.
"Here, chew on these.","Good news is, all the pilots are red-meat men. Although I was kind of looking forward to landing this puppy myself."

"Or you're wrong and we're gonna start seeing neurological symptoms soon. Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.",We're not gonna see ataxia.

"It's not that. It's my eye. My right eye, I... I can't see.",It's definitely ataxia. It's definitely a rash.
You wanna look at it for five more minutes before concluding it's also definitely a leg.,Thin leg. It's been in a cast.
So?,So it could be radiation poisoning.
From a broken leg?,From the X-rays they took of it.
He could break Every bone in his body and still not have enough x-rays to cause radiation sickness.,"Unless those X-rays were performed in ""Wankoff"", North Korea by a third-grade dropout with a 50-year-old imager.

He says he's not.,"Hey! Don't make me turn the hose on you two. Chase is right. You two go check the House, see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man."
You're intentionally punishing us.,"By making you do your job? Does seem kind of cruel doesn't it? Take along a carbon monoxide detector to check for leaks and you start her on hydroxyurea to control her red blood cell production. Take out a Merck Manual, mEdieval edition, tell you how to drain a pint or two so she doesn't clot again."
What if it's sexual? We should call social services.,"Well this sucks. Either it's abuse or it's not abuse. Which means either it's a symptom or it's completely irrelevant. Either way we have to waste half a day figuring out which. Full physical exam. Look for bruises we may have missed, check her mouth and do a vaginal exam."
We can't do a vaginal exam on a 6 year old without the Dad's consent and if he's abusing her he'll nEver say yes.,NEver is just rEven spelt backwards.
Are those the urine test results?,Yes.
And!,I'm going to ask you for some blood.
Why?,To see if your answer will be 'I can't bleed in public'. This wasn't your urine was it?
Why would I give you someone else's urine?,Usual reason is because you're on steroids.
I'm not an athlete.,Duh. The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs.
I'm not.,"I am. Third favourite reason is ï¿½ you have insurance but your friend, Eggs Benedict, doesn't. So Eggs describes a list of symptoms and you repeat them to a doctor. Which is particularly stupid because this is a free clinic."
"Need you, now.",My work here is done.
Am! I! ok? Is it diabetes?,"No, you're pregnant."
6-year-old abuse victim and you haven't called social services?,She might have been abused. That's horrifying. Why are you wearing extra concealer under your eyes?
"The law's clear, you suspect abuse you call the authorities. You don't proceed as usual while the possible abuser sits by her bedside.","Dad consented to the exam, which means it's not the Dad. How late were you out last night?"
It's always the Dad and I don't have a curfew.,Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?
"I went to a play, House you are going back to your office, you are picking up your phone, calling social services and you are reporting suspected abuse. Do you understand?",What play?
What play?,You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.
Fries?,You took her to a play. You only take women to plays because...
"No, YOU only take women to plays for that reason. That's your theory.","Ok, then why did you take her to a play?"
She's a friend.,A friend with a squish mitten.
It is possible to have a friend of the opposite sex without...,"Blasphemer! She's not a friend of the opposite sex, she's a different species. She's an administrator. She's going to eat your head after she's done."
"Yes, I slept with her.",Seriously?
No.,Yes you did.
Yes I did.,Seriously?
We just tested the blood on Lucy's t-shirt. It's full of endometrial cells.,It's not her blood.
"She got her period and didn't know what it was. She was scared and confused. A friend told her to put a t-shirt in her underwear. When she started growing pubic hair, she snuck Daddy's razor and tried to shave it off.",Apparently forgot to sneak the shaving cream.
She's 6. She's tiny. She lives on Parkcken fingers and milk. Dad doesn't look like the type to read labels. He's pRobably buying stuff packed full of hormones.,Excellent argument. It's a tumour.
"There's all sorts of environmental sources. Pesticides, soy products! Some shampoos are basically a placenta in a bottle.",If the tumour's not in her brain it's in her reproductive tract. Get an MRI.
Can I at least...,Waste your time? Wouldn't recognise you if you didn't.
You have to choose one. There's a bright spot on her left ovary. Looks like a solid tumour.,They printed my letter.
You were right.,Of course I was. What are we talking about? They printed my letter.
Great. Cuddy.,You want to see her naked.
"No, no, no. She wants to see ME naked. She sent me flowers.",Just thanking you for the play. You see some people fell an emotion called gratitude.
There's a card.,I suspected. Explains how you knew who they were from.
Lets do it again. Soon. X X. Lisa. Xs are the kisses right?,No! I think they're the hugs. I think Os are the kisses.
"No, no, Xs are definitely the kisses. Soon is its own sentence. I got to go.",I'll miss you. You were a good friend. They printed my letter. How was the play Mrs. Lincoln?
What's up with Wilson?,He's just a little freaked.
Why?,I sent him flowers.
Get him off! AHH! He's biting me! Get him off! AHH!,Somebody better be dying.
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me so he bit the crap out of Chase.,And I care because?
Just thought you might want to know when one of your employees gets attacked by a sociopath.,"Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no."
Hello?,He's not a sociopath.
How do you know?,He's acting logically. He's got a crush on you. He's being aggressive about it. Not just regular aggressive. He's out of his mind on hormones aggressive.
You think he's...,Better figure out what's killing the girl cause her brother's got it too.
Yes you would think that if for some reason you were completely unaware of the fact that we spent the entire night testing Everything from that home. It was all negative.,You went home? Good for you. Delegate.
We're not his subordinates.,Making it all the more impressive.
That's ridiculous. If menstruation is a symptom of brain cancer then I should be on chemo right now.,That's ridiculous. You're way too skinny to be menstruating.
What if the mum had other pRoblems? Symptoms her doctors ignored on account of the fact she was already dying.,"Pull all of her medical records, find any similarities to our Patients, and punch the little brat on the nose so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister."
Stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas. Found two more in her kidneys and one in her lung. They weren't there 48 hours ago. The hormones are making her body go haywire.,"If she gets one in her brain or heart, she's dead. No pressure though."
It's not genetic. It's not environmental. It's got to be a pituitary adenoma.,"Yes, that would make complete sense if they had one."
Just because we haven't found anything on the scan doesn't mean it's not there. We should remove her pituitary gland.,"Two siblings, same condition. Its got to be genetic or environmental. If you add in 'same time' and we're back to just environmental."
Yes and that would make complete sense if there was anything in her environment.,Just because we haven't found anything yet.
I'm getting the father's consent.,No! We have no evidence.
The ovaries produce sex hormones in response to a signal from the pituitary gland. Since we know the ovaries are fine the most likely cause...,"Most likely means she wants to root around inside your little girl's brain without any guarantee that it will work, that's why she's holding off on doing your son."
Dr. House knows that unfortunately we've ruled out Every other option. We need to resect Lucy's pituitary before...,Who else visits these kids?
They don't have any family in town.,You got a girlfriend?
No one visits.,School?
"They don't go to the same school, House I...",Nanny?
They go to an after school day care but none of the other kids are sick.,"Yet. It took your son twice as long to dEvelop symptoms as your daughter, maybe the other kids are just slow."
We wait and your daughter may die.,She does this and your daughter will need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of her life.
The treatments are extremely effective. She should lead a relatively normal life.,"And isn't that Every parents dream, to have a kid grow up to be relatively normal."
My husband died of thyroid cancer that metastasised to his brain. I've been there. I know how terrifying this can be. I am telling you this is your best chance to save your daughter's life.,You did NOT just play the dead husband card. My wife died because she signed a consent form that I didn't want her to sign. Died.
Thank you.,How did you know?
Know what?,That the other kids weren't sick. You've been here for 4 days.
I just... I would've heard.,Right...
Right...,Do you have hair on your special place?
Can I help you?,I'm a doctor. Two of your kids are sick and I need to know why.
You think they got sick here?,I think you're dating their Dad.
He told you?,"No, but I don't really care why he didn't. I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring."
I don't.,"Shampoos, fancy soaps, kids get in your bag?"

"Yeah, I think so.",Talk to Cuddy?
"No, not yet! I don't know what to say.",Just... be straight with her.
I'm not sure what that is. I... I can't stop thinking about her.,In what way?
"Maybe she's right, maybe... maybe this is worth exploring?",You sure she feels...
She sent me flowers! How do I do this? What do I say?,"Cameron would tell you to say how you feel. Me, I'd get her drunk."
"I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to walk into her office, and I'm going to kiss her.","That's... a bold move, Cuddy likes bold. Yeah, your right, if you spoke you'd say something stupid."
"Yeah. I mean I'll either get a girlfriend or get fired. Ok... yea... ok... You, you, you! You were going to let me do that?!",Well you made a compelling argument.
YOU sent those flowers to me!,"Yes, because, you took her to a play because actually you do want to march down there and kiss her."
No! I don't!,Yes you do.
You're right.,Seriously?
No. You're a jerk.,Night Wilson.

"Oh, you! okay.",She said she was busy.
"And you didn't beliEve her, so you bribed a janitor, broke into her computer, checked her appointments ""ï¿½",I asked her as a test.
What would you have learned if she'd said yes?,"A lot about bondage. She's busy for me, but not for you. She's not interested in the play qua play, she's interested in you."
"No. I'm not getting sucked into the vortex of your insanity again. Don't pass me notes in class, don't tell me to ask her to the prom ""ï¿½",You cannot see her socially. You're leading her on!
"I'll consider that after I take her to the Hockney exhibit. On Thursday. See, she is busy. It's not a date. She enjoyed the play. I enjoyed her enjoying the play. The Woman works hard, it's nice to see her relax.",So all this enjoying is an act of charity?

"Wow, you remember where our first date was? I didn't think you were paying attention.",Really? He's my best friend.
Our first date was in Boston.,Oh. Not quite as close to here as I remembered.
But we're not here to talk about him.,Absolutely not.
Wait 'till you see the kitchen. All granite countertops!,"Since I wasn't paying attention back then, what was it like dating him?"
"Oh, it was nEver a date. I was coming off a bad relationship and he said we could go out as friends, you know, go see plays, go to a museum. I didn't think you liked Trenton.","Love it. So he'd say it's not a date, but then he'd jump you."
"Oh no, he meant it. Wilson, carefully calibrating his lEvel of protectiveness for your individual needs.",Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?

Wait! to stop the train? Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?,"Huh?! Yeah. She also said if she slept with you before she liked you, then it would have been easier to handle when you turned into the sorry bastard that left her alone."
"I told her you were wasting her time, by the way.",You think that's going to stop her? The Woman's the worst realtor in New Jersey.
That's not cancer. It sounds like!,It sounds like she's septic.

But she had no fEver. Her LP was clear.,"Do an echo to confirm it's in her heart, and then I'll tell our Patient that we just killed her."

"Well, um, but if you have half an hour this afternoon, I just found this unit, it hasn't been on the market yet ""ï¿½",I'm off the market for condos.
James was right. I nEver had the teeniest chance of selling you anything.,Of course he was right. He doesn't stop giving good advice just because you're divorced. He's compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.
Do you want to know why I named that dog Hector?,No. Let's keep it a mystery.
"Because Even when he was a puppy, he was the worst-tempered dog we'd Ever seen he. He was supposed to be House-trained, but he'd pee on the carpet Every morning. When we had people over, he would nip at their ankles. ""Hector does go rug""ï¿½ is an anagram for ""Doctor Greg House""ï¿½ ""ï¿½ that's how early in the marriage I resented you.",Wow. Did I Ever waste money on that place setting.
James at least had the decency to feel guilty when he hurt me!,"Whereas I nEver hurt you! I nEver Even married you, clEverly hoping to avoid moments like this one."
"You always needed him, and he was always there for you!","You keep yelling, and I'll think you owe me sex."
"You knew he had a wife waiting at home, you didn't care. I'm not saying you broke up the marriage, but you didn't help.","First, ""Hector does go rug""ï¿½ is a lame anagram. You want a better one for ""Gregory House""ï¿½: ""Huge ego, sorry""ï¿½. Second, find a new career. You're nEver going to sell to anybody if you let them control the agenda. And third, I don't owe you anything. I'm not Wilson, I'm not going to buy a condo just to make you feel better."
What are you doing?,"Prepping for an aspiration. We still don't know what infection ""ï¿½"
It's not going to help her.,"It's not going to hurt her. Well, it is going to hurt her, but ""ï¿½"
No.,"This will just take a few minutes. Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus ""ï¿½"
You really don't care.,You really don't care why she's going to be dead.
"She's going to be dead ""ï¿½","WHAT? What did we screw up, what did we miss? I need to know."
No.,Yeah?
I got your consent.,Her bra hook.
What?,She scratched herself with her bra hook. That's how the infection got in. Staph aureus.
She died from a simple Staph infection?,That and some bad decisions.
I'll be outside.,"Go home, have a few drinks, go to sleep, get up tomorrow, and do it tomorrow, only better. If you need absolution, go to a priest or give alms to the poor, whatEver ritual comforts you."
I killed her.,"Yeah, me too."
"This wasn't, ""oh, I should have thought of that idea sooner""ï¿½. This wasn't messing up a dosage. We see a disease rushing down on someone like a train, we can't always get them out of the way. But this wasn't that.","No. And you'll do it again. To a lot of doctors, this would be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of mistake. But we're not a lot of doctors. We'll save a lot more Patients than the guy down the street, but a few of the ones he'd save by doing what Everyone else does we will lose."
So you're giving me numbers?,"Because they don't lie. I can't forgive you, Foreman, because there's nothing to forgive."
What'd you tell him?,That guilt is irrelevant.
You wanna get something to eat?,Can't. I've got a dog waiting at home.
I know. It's okay. Musta been a drag. We just had to make sure you weren't exposed to any bugs. Because your healthy bone marrow is what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia--,C'mon.

They're African-American. It makes it nearly impossible to find a full match.,Tell me about it. I can't Even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?
Tell me about it. I can't Even find the one I've got working for me. Where is Foreman?,Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.
Ha! Nothing like a dead Patient to send you back to your choir-boy roots.,Hey! You're not gonna beliEve what happened. Wilson just killed a kid the same way you did.
He's not dead.,Five days are gonna fly by. He didn't look both ways before he nuked. You done talking to your imaginary friend? Because I thought maybe you could do your job.
We should start the donor brother on broad-spectrum antibiotics.,"Great idea, if you're looking to save exactly one kid. Broad-spec will take at least a week to work. We need narrow-spec. How old is Hector?"
Hector's my dog. He's about sEventeen.,SEventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in huMan years. Why's he still alive?
Blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.,"That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles."
"That's 'cause the infection is too small. We start testing now, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We draw blood, odds are we're just gonna come up with hay. We need to grow more needles.","Okay, that... pRobably needs further explanation. We make the donor kid sicker. We freeze him, we soak him, break down his immune system. Suddenly we're looking at some needle a camel can pass through the eye of."
Making him sicker risks spreading the infection all throughout his body.,"True, but who cares? Once we know what the infection is, we'll know exactly how to treat it. As long as he isn't dead yet, we're cool."
"We should do what we normally do - Go to the kid's House, check for sources of infection.",Waste of time. You think it's in the House. I know it's in the Patient.
Safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.,Fine. Go.

This is your family. It needs to be your decision.,"All you had to do was say, ""Yes, I do."" God knows that's a phrase you've used often enough in your life."
It was a mistake Every time. Give it a break. They said yes.,That's not enough for you. You need them to feel good about saying yes.
"I treat Patients for months, maybe years, not weeks like you.",I'm taller.
"If they don't trust me, I can't do my job.",The only value of that trust is you can Manipulate them.
You should write greeting cards.,Giving parents the chance to make a bad choice was a bad choice.
At least it would've been their choice.,One they'd regret at their son's funeral.
He has acute scrotum.,"Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified."
"Adorable! Please, I thought you were dignified.","Come on, how am I not supposed to make that joke? The best thing about big honkin' gonads -"
Can Chase and Cameron cover that?,Mind if I ask why?
I want to recheck the national marrow registry for an alternate donor.,In case we're wrong?
It's been known to happen.,Fine. Go.
...mitral valve rules him out as a donor.,This is perfect.
We drove the infection into his heart.,"Okay. Perfect is too strong a word. But it's very, very good. Now we know where the infection is. All we gotta do is remove the valve, ID the infection, target and destroy."
Remove the valve? He'll be fine on antibiotics. He doesn't need open heart surgery.,He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.
"Either way, he's got a dead brother. The infection isn't just in the valve. Even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.","We don't have to. We have to clear his marrow. After the surgery, harvest the marrow, marinate it in the targeted antibiotic, simmer and serve."
I'm running this by Cuddy.,"Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go."
Do you have anything to add to this Debate?,"Wilson's right, Foreman's wrong, and your shirt is way too rEvealing for the office."
House. Did he really think I was gonna do that?,I didn't.
Then why did you let him...?,Tried to cut him some slack.
Nice of you.,I think he's got the yips.
I think he's got the yips.,"Steve Blass, Scott Norwood, David Duval. All got the yips. Great athletes. Lost their confidence, and immediately started sucking."
And you're... giving him time to work through it?,"Mm-hmm! Four days, then he's fired. You don't get better from the yips."
Open-heart surgery?,"If you want both kids to live, it's the only choice."
What about the marrow registry? Maybe they'll find a match.,Maybe they'll ride it here on a unicorn.
Either we cripple one son or kill the other.,He won't be able to play baseball. But that doesn't make him a cripple.
You should protect your family as a whole. You should do the surgery.,That was awesome!
Shut up.,I gotta start pretending to care.
I did exactly what Cuddy told us not to do.,"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear."
"No, you didn't. You did exactly what she told me not to do. You're completely in the clear.",You've gotta be kidding me. You're actually upset. You just said what you beliEved.
I also beliEve in Patients making their own choices.,Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.
Because it lessens your guilt if things go wrong. You're not protecting your choices.,You're soothing your conscience.
"By that logic, a sociopath would make the best Patient advoCate in the world.",Am I blushing?
Canula in place. Sutures are holding. We're all set to go. Switch him over to bypass.,Yeah?
I didn't do the surgery.,You woke me up to tell me that you're lazy.
We biopsied a piece before we started cutting.,I'm tired. Get to the point.
We didn't replace the valve because the growth was fibrous tissue. It wasn't infectious. We gotta be wrong about...,"Oh, God."
What? You know what's wrong with Matty?,I think Hector's committed suicide.
What are you talking about?,He took some pills.
Is he alive?,He ate half my stash. Of course he's...
He ate half my stash. Of course he's...,He's stoned. I'll be right in.
He's stoned. I'll be right in.,"Cut all the way into this kid's heart, and all we got was this lousy, non-infectious fibrous tissue."
Matty had a fEver. Got sicker when we suppressed his immune system. That all points to,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Not our fault. Fibrous tissue! Something is turning his healthy heart valve to gristle.
Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along in bone marrow. He can still donate. We,Lupus and BehÃ§ets are our best bet. Do an ANA and a pathergy test.
Or... it could be infection.,"My memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out eight seconds ago?"
Just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.,"Uh-huh, and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along. A little disadvantage of making big brother dead."
That's your argument? Better outcome?,It fits.
The family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune. Wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.,That's your argument? It sucks for them?
"It fits, and we can still help big brother. National marrow registry came up with a four out of six donors.","Six out of six is two better than four out of six, right? I mean, I know two is so small, but since it means that he's gonna get Graft vs. Host disease, the marrow will attack his body and he'll die a painful death. Find out what autoimmune it is."
Is this bad?,Wanna catch a movie?
It's one in the morning.,I know a place. Although I wouldn't recommend wearing those shoes.
How exactly does a dog unscrew a bottle of pills?,Is that a riddle?
It requires an opposable thumb.,I must have left it off.
On the floor?,I think he hopped upon to the bathroom counter.
Not me this time.,"No! It's your damn dog! He chews Everything! I was missing a file. Found paper in his stool. An original Sun record '78 Elvis recording - gone! Who the hell chews vinyl? He's vindictive. And he's had a good, long life. It's his time."
Are you okay?,I just tripped over Wilson's self-righteousness.
I just tripped over Wilson's self-righteousness.,What d'you got?
We've got to go with the four out of six donors.,"Hmm. Did I mention my concerns about four being less than six? Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue. Of course, that time, it was only fatal to their marriage."
It's either that or we start randomly testing Matty for infections. I know you hate the word random.,Do it alphabetically. We're not doing that damn transplant. Where's Foreman?
Dr. Foreman explained...,Did he also explain what sort of pain your son will experience if he gets Graft vs. Host
Yes.,"Apparently, he didn't explain it vividly enough. Let me give it a whack."
Foreman screwed us.,No! You screwed us.
No! You screwed us.,"What is the point in being able to control people if you won't actually do it? 'S like training a dog and then letting him go on your rug. Which, by the way..."
"Once Foreman got his mitts on them, there was no way...",You don't explain chances and pRobabilities. You lie to them. You tell them Foreman's a moron - which isn't Even much of a lie right now.
You gotta to talk to him.,I got no pRoblem with what Foreman did.
He undercut us and he may have cost that kid his life!,"Well, he did what he thought was right! You, on the other hand, sucked out! When the decision really mattered, you didn't have the guts to tell them what to do! 'F that kid dies, it's because Foreman was wrong AND because you're a coward!"
"The camera zooms towards the needle and into the Man's bone. The needle pierces through the bone, sending small bone fragments around. The needle starts to aspirate the marrow. The marrow flows quickly through the needle, as we...]","Oh, goodness! I've left my door open! My poor dog must've run away and been hit by a car or... truck. Or train."
"Oh, goodness! I've left my door open! My poor dog must've run away and been hit by a car or... truck. Or train.",Or an anvil.
Or an anvil.,Thank God. You're still here. He's still here!
Thank God. You're still here. He's still here!,Where's my stereo?
It really itches.,Hello?
Why am I meeting you here?,Paying for my new cane. It was your dog.
"So that's it. You call me a coward, life goes on.",Apparently. Showed up.
Apparently. Showed up.,Hey.
Hey.,I'm sorry.
Okay.,You're pathetic. I didn't actually mean that.
"Yes, you did.","No, I didn't. To infinity."
"Yes, you did. You're pathetic.",Yeah. When? What did the lab say? Uh-huh?
Why don't you buy your cane in a medical supply store like a normal cripple?,Fewer bitParkn' choices. Okay.
Fewer bitParkn' choices. Okay.,What do you got in bitParkn'?
Right this way.,That was Cameron. The kid that wasn't all that sick is now all that sick. He's bleeding out of his ears.
Blood counts?,Down.
SParkstocytes on the smear?,His body's not making new blood cells. His bone marrow's crashing.
This is one of our top sellers.,It's a little too Marilyn Manson in a retirement home. Meds are suppressing his bone marrow.
Or the infection's doing it.,Very cool.
Genuine bull penis stretched over a metal rod.,Penis canes are murder. Let me see the one on the end.
You got it.,"You need to stop Matty's meds. The marrow rebounds, it's the meds. If it doesn't, it's an infection."
And if it's the infection?,Maybe I was wrong about which kid's gonna die.
Flames.,"Makes it look like I'm going fast. Now, how's our dying kids?"
Already did. It's not working.,Feeling guilty?
I did the right thing.,"Always a comfort. Okay, what's the other kid's status?"
We're done with Nick?,God is done with Nick. We know what he has. We know how to treat it. We're doing it. It's not working. Life is for the living.
"If we don't get this under control, his blood will literally turn into water.",Cultures still aren't growing anything.
Why not?,"Because you did the right thing. Convinced the parents to treat the kid. All you did was yank the weed out of the ground. It's roots are still killing your beautiful lawn. We just can't see it. And if we can't see it, we don't know what it is. And if we don't know what it is, we can't kill it. You gotta wait for it to grow back again. Now his soil is arid. So he and his brother will be dead by the time..."

So he and his brother will be dead by the time...",What if the dandelion was in fertile soil? What if we take the roots from Matty and put them in Nick? Turn the kid into a petri dish? Only better. A petri dish can't tell you when it hurts.
You want to give him his brother's infection? The very thing we've been trying to avoid since the brother sneezed?,Leukemia kid's got no defenses.
Which is why he'll die.,"But before he does, the infection will spread, fast. Fast enough to tell us what it is. In time to save his brother."
But it'll kill Nick.,Yes.
You're... you're saying we should kill one son to save the other?,Nick is gonna die either way.
"It can change. May-maybe he'll-he'll rally. Hey, my Nick is a fighter.",Graft vs. Host is not gonna go away because of Nick's sunny smile and positive outlook.
Nick has survived three reoccurrences of his leukemia.,He's being torn apart from the inside out. His pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies. You're just dragging it out. You have only one decision to make - to leave here with one dead son or two.
He's being torn apart from the inside out. His pain's gonna get worse and worse until he dies. You're just dragging it out. You have only one decision to make - to leave here with one dead son or two.,Tell 'em.
We're not giving up on Nick. Not!,Patients' parents apparently don't want to be parents anymore. You're a sneaky bastard. Any ideas how we get around this?
Court order?,That's hardly sneaky.
We can still save Matty. Run more tests. Find out what infection is destroying his marrow.,Ten thousand possible infections. At least twenty minutes per test. Take you approximately eight years.
He's right. It's worth a shot.,He's timid. Testing blindly is not gonna save this kid.
But standing around here will.,"Wow, he sure is hurting."
Nurses say he maxed out on his pain meds.,If I had a nickel for Every time I heard that.
If I had a nickel for Every time I heard that.,Pharmacy's on the ground floor.
Thank you.,It's not gonna help. You're dying. Nothing's gonna change that. Drugs'll just make you go easier.
I know.,"Fourteen years on the planet. Most of them spent suffering. Dying before you Even got to drive a car, take off a girl's bra, drink a beer. BeliEve me, there's plenty you haven't done. Really good stuff. Must make it hard to beliEve in God or... fairness, a larger purpose. But your life doesn't have to be meaningless. You can save your brother."
No! Stop! Stop!,How much heat are you taking from the parents?
"They're calming down. I think it has something to do with both their kids being alive, awake, and eating. The marrow transplant took.","Welcome back, Foreman."
You should talk to him.,Tell him how proud I am?
"Hey, if you're ashamed of him, you can tell him that.","Pride and shame only apply to people we have a vested interest in, not employees."
How Many hours a day do you have to spend with someone before they're basically family?,"Good point. But first, I gotta tell Cameron and Chase that they're violating God's will."
I'm just asking you to have an adult conversation to let him know...,... he did a good job? He knows it. Adults don't need adult conversations. Just like I don't need this conversation.
Have you killed Hector yet?,Obviously not.
Oh. He's quiet. He's... Is that my stethoscope?,Bad dog!
"Listen, Bonnie joined her home owners' association and staged a coup. Pets are now allowed. If you want to keep him, she wants a new puppy anyway. She'll understand.",Why would I want to keep him?
Accidents happen.,Candy?
Candy?,Good boy.
Good boy.,Good boy.
Good boy.,You did good.
I did what you would have.,"Well, maybe I'm biased, but--"
I tortured the kid.,Because you knew it was right. You knew you were saving his brother.
"I know. I don't like that I know. I hate that I can listen to a kid screaming in pain and not Even take a moment to question whether I'm doing the right thing. I hate that in order to be like you as a doctor, I have to be like you as a huMan being. I don't want to turn into you.",You're not. You've been like me since you were eight years old.
I nEver Even hit her.,Morning. This is funny People don't...
"Bronchoscopy was pristine, so much for the lungs.",Good morning.
"Which means no ulcer or GI bleed. Which means it's not from her stomach, either. Which means it didn't come from anywhere.",You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
"Rupture in her sinus cavity, dripped through the back.",Not that much blood.
Trauma from karate?,No trauma. She kicked the other guy's ass.
Now a good time?,If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear in a!
What's going on?,Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
Why?,He's afraid of turning into me.
Thank you.,That's it? You're not going to tell him that we're a family and families don't abandon each other?
You want me to?,No.
"Good luck, Dr. Foreman.","So, where were we?"
College sophomore coughing up blood.,"Not the case, the speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts. Did Foreman get a promotion?"
What?,Personally I can't beliEve I've had the same three employees for three years.
Patient could have a heart pRoblem.,Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
"Hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs, she coughed up the overflow. Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's travelling through normal plumbing.","Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right. Cameron, check out the dorm and redo the ER labs. I'll get going on Foreman's farewell party. Everybody good with a mermaid under the stars theme?"
What? A brain pRoblem? Messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood. She has no neurological issues. She had a shiver.,I think there's an infection.
"We've ruled out infection because no fEver, no white count. [They stop in front of Wilson's office.","I think there's an infection. Blood goes where it's needed. Infection likes nice, wet places, her lungs. Start treatment. All that cool stuff for bacterial, fungal and atypical infections. Get a lung biopsy, I want to see the little bugger up close."
Why's Foreman quitting?,He wants to breed llamas.
"Interesting. You're ashamed of the reason, too.",No one writes tamoxifen like you.
"Well, I use a G.",Foreman resigned.
I'm sorry.,It's okay. No biggie.
Right. He give a reason?,He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort. Can't remember what it was at the moment.
You don't want to end up like you.,Good point. Can I resign? What's up with that?
With what?,"You yawned. I just told you something interesting, so you're not bored. It's 11 o'clock in the morning and you're drinking coffee, so you're not tired. I didn't yawn, so it's not a mirror-neuron reaction. Which leaves symptom, vasovagal issue, maybe a heart pRoblem?"
"My heart's fine, I was up late. You're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.",I'm ok with Foreman leaving.
"Either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving, or you just jumped right to acceptance.",Sorry. I yawned because I was trying to communiCate boredom.
"You could try bargaining with him, give him a raise.",How much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me? Thanks for the coffee.
She seems fine.,She is fine.
She coughed up blood.,Past tense.
She has diarrhoea.,From the antibiotics for the infection.
Lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.,"Well, then, you screwed up the biopsy."
Or you're wrong about infection.,"Well if I'm wrong, then so is her body, because it obviously thinks she's got an infection or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics. What is pandiculation symptomatic of?"
Does this have anything to do with Addie?,Lets say yes.
"Cerebral tumour, epilepsy! Could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants or some meds for end stage liver failure.",Lets say no.
"But now you are? No, now you're nervous, uncomfortable about your decision. It wasn't Even that good a joke.",Oh crap.
Most of your jokes are excellent. I just meant in comparison.,Shut up. I think she may not have an infection. You better deal with her before she crashes.
"Heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.","There's something called blued in the pleural effusion. Oh, it's not blued, it's blood. Which is great. Well not for her, but for me. Because it means I think it's an infection."
Labs indiCated minute traces of blood.,"Can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?"
"If we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection. It could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.","Great. Go tell her she's got one of those. Or you could tell her we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her INFECTION. Double the dose, and check her lungs."
"We checked her lungs, they're clean.",On the outside. She needs an arteriogram.
It's about my bowel movements.,"What isn't, these days? You sure you want to be here for this?"
We do Everything together.,"Of course. The toilet can be a lonely place. Drop your pants, I'll suit up."
They float.,Huh?
I'm a nutritionist.,"Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals."
Thank you.,You're welcome. And the natural fibre clothing I assume means some kind of vegetarian denomination?
We're vegans. At first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein but Honey showed me you can get it from lots of...,"Well, whatEver floats your poop. And you've been together how long? 6 months?"
How'd you know?,Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break.
Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break.,Three 10-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines.
Which means her lungs are fine.,What if the clear arteriogram is significant?
It is significant. It means there's no infection.,I think there's an infection.
"Infections don't come and go, people don't get better then worse on the same treatment.",Unless her body can't finish off the fight ï¿½ maybe goes a couple of rounds then gives up.
Why would it give up?,Maybe its name is Foreman. C'mon... where's that smile? That laugh that makes the whole world sunny without contributing to global warming? Maybe she's missing a protein.
Blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.,"You can't have tested for Every protein, I can think of at least one you can't test for at all."
Complement factor-H deficiency. But if she has that she's dead. No way to fend off bacteria. She'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.,Maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up. Give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.
There's no diagnostic test for complement factor-H deficiency.,So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it. Stick a needle in her eye. You're cheating on Honey.
"What? No, I'm not.","Oh, yes you are."
It's ok. I get it.,"Well I was going to say relax but, oddly enough, you seem pretty relaxed already."
You're accomplished. You're funny. You can have whatEver you want. Women are going to...,"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group."
What?,His floaters float because they're full of fat. PRobably had a big cheeseburger for lunch.
"Soy cakes taste like cardboard, unsalted cardboard.",I'm accomplished. I'm funny. Can I have whatEver I want?
Ok.,You rang?
You called me.,I bought you an espresso. You've been buying me coffee for a couple of weeks I thought I'd pay you back. With one.
How did you walk with the cane and the two coffees?,Why are you suspicious?
"Because it's either that, or accept the fact that you've done something nice. And then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.","What, you think I spat in yours?"
Or worse.,I stacked them.
I stacked them.,"What do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist? I mean, they sound almost the same."
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.,Don't cheapen this. We had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats. I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.
You asked for a date while your finger was in her boyfriend?,Got her number.
"No, no. No way. This is an employment application. She doesn't want to go out with you she's looking for a job. Oh, God. She's 26.",But with the wisdom of a much younger Woman.
Have you spoken to Foreman?,SEveral times. We laugh...
You're going to lose him.,And that will be depressing. But it will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have.
Which means we should be looking for a tumour.,I think there's an infection. Just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet doesn't mean they're working.
So why did we do the test.,Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.,That's the beauty of the test.
She needs an MRI of her brain.,"Absolutely. As long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess or something caused by an infection?"
My head. My head!,Grody.
Looks like massive tissue death.,Who cares? Her head blew up. How cool is that?
It's not pusy.,"Meaning you don't think it's an infection, and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong."
Here we go again.,"She's got infections that come and go, which means..."
It means it has to be something else!,"Good guess, but no! Means either she's got a leprechaun in her colon which is playing with the doggie door, letting bacteria in and out or... she got complement factor-H deficiency."
You enjoying this?,"I'm saving a Woman's life. I'm saving a Woman's life. Actually I'm diagnosing her. Technically I'm diagnosing her with something that's going to kill her but, other than that, I'm saving her life."
An autoimmune pRoblem makes more sense.,You can't explain transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis. You'd need three whiteboards and 100 different coloured markers.
"If it's autoimmune she can live, but we have to give her steroids, now, before her heart ruptures.","If you're wrong, and you give her steroids, she dies, now. Foreman, want to run down how it feels to go with your gut and kill a person? You get into the whole spiralling out of control and self-doubt, resigning thing. Do it. Worst that can happen is you quit. Cameron, want to explain to the parents why you'll be holding paddles while he's doing it? Because if her heart goes 'boom' it'll 'boom' right away."
Ready.,My Patient's about to have a heart attack. It's going to be massive!
Oh well that's too bad cause I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor. Have you had a conversation with Foreman?,Can you do me a favour?
"You haven't, because then you would have to confront your own emotions.","Is bile an emotion? Cause I can definitely feel something here Get me some liquorice. This is going to be the best heart attack of all time. Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait. She's going to shock her."
You dosed me!,"Yes... I did, but only because you didn't trust me! Your best friend."
You could have killed me!,Amphetamines aren't going to kill you.
You don't know my medical history! I c-c-c-c... I could've... You could've given me a heart attack.,"Well, a heart attack is not going to kill you. You were in a hospital. Aha! You yawned!"
Aha! You tried to kill me.,"I put you on uppers and you still yawned. Means it's a symptom, of being a big fat liar. Yawning is a side effect of some antidepressants, apparently the ones you're on."
I'm not on antidepressants I'm on SPEEEEEED!,Well that means it's a symptom of a cerebral tumour. You got six weeks to live. Mr. Well-adjusted is as messed up as the rest of us. Wh-why would you keep that a secret? Are you ashamed of recognising how pathetic your life is?
It's not a secret. House it's-it's... it's personal!,How long has it been personal?
It's personal!,Yawning's recent so! either you just started or you changed prescription.
This is why I take them.,"They're antidepressants, not anti-annoyance-ants. You'd think this would naturally come up in conversation with..."
Oh don't act hurt. You don't care!,On one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.
"You wouldn't take them! You'd rather OD on Vicodin or stick electrodes in your head, because you can say you did it to get high. The only reason to take antidepressants is because you're depressed. You! you have to admit that you're depressed.",Give me.
Are you going to admit that...,Nope. I'm going to prove that I'm not depressed.
Haha. ... Well I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psyParkatrist. You need a whole work up. Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke.,I! wouldn't drink that. My leg hurt and I!
House. Why didn't you pick up the phone? We've been calling.,I was sleeping.
What did you do?,Nothing! This is how regular people look when you wake them up.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys. Peripheral smear of red cells had sParkstocytes.,"Huh. HUS is usually caused by an infection or a protein deficiency. What coincidence I know a Patient with an infection and a protein deficiency. You think it's possible there is a connection? I want to hear you say it, Chase. It will please me."
"Doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest, INSTANT cardiac arrest.","There were only two choices, since yours was wrong, mine must have been right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun."
"If you're right then there's nothing to be done. The steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits it'll hit hard. Liver failure, cardiac arrest.","But on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis. Don't you see how incredible this call was? A protein deficiency. Can't be tested, can't be seen. I called it based on coughing blood."
She's going to die.,"That's not my fault. She was going to die anyway. Now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why."
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude in her eyes when you tell her.,I'm not telling her.
I'm not telling her.,No one's telling her. Not until we're sure I'm right.
But we're going to wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her?,Seems like the huMane approach.
"Her heart went into V-fib. Brought her back, barely. Congratulations, you have your confirmation. What's her name?",Who? The co-ed?
Sure.,Dead sophomore girl?
You know her father's name?,Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.
"Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.",You think they're going to give a crap if I know their names? Five years from now when the father's looking at photographs of his daughter graduating from high school they're not going to remember the nice black doctor who called them by their first name. You don't want to quit.
You saying you don't want me to quit?,"Didn't sound like I said that. I'm saying that suddenly you're trying to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass. Because you know who you are. You figure if you can make me decent and caring, then maybe there's a hope for..."
"You are about to tell a girl she is dying and you think it's about you. God, I hope I'm not you.",I'm sorry. Addie you're dying.
Are you sure?,Yes. Your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.
How long?,"Two days, maybe less. You have a condition called..."
Does it matter.,It's a very rare protein deficiency that only...
I don't want to hear it.,Ok. It's what's killing you. This is what's killing you. You're not interested in what's killing you?
"Please, could you just leave?","What's the point in living,without curiosity? Without craving the..."
Get out of here.,It's-it's-it's like the... dark matter in the universe...
You're smiling.,"No I'm not. You can only diagnose a pRoblem by looking at what's... missing... Oh, God. I have to go."
Ahh.,19-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's going to die. . Begged me to shut up.
If you can't shut up at least talk quietly.,Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.
You were happy?,"No! I was hazy. I don't get hazy on Vicodin, or anything else I throw down. Which means I was throwing down something I didn't know I was throwing down. Which got me to wondering, why didn't you give me those happy pills?"
I told you. You got to be checked out by...,"No, you just didn't want me double dosing. You dosed me! Those coffees..."
"They worked! You've been smiling, relaxed, happy!",A dying girl thought I was happy. A moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
House was happy.,Hazy.
Happy.,Hazy!
"Oh, right. A dying girl mistook hazy for happy, because dying people see happiness Everywhere. She's miserable.",She wasn't miserable.
Of course she was miserable you just told her she was...,"She was no different then she's Ever been. She was no different than she'd Ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go."
"She was no different then she's Ever been. She was no different than she'd Ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go.",Need a minute with your daughter.
Dr. House get out of here before...,She's going to live. Does that help? Now get out.
Are you jerking us around?,Get out! You... have got leprechauns in ya. Depression Manifests in lots of different ways. Some people can't get out of bed all day. Others have serial relationships and become oncologists.
"I'm dying, I'm not depressed.","Wrong and wrong. You tried to kill yourself by throwing down kitchen cleanser. Now most normal suicidal morons would have just drank the stuff, burned the hell out of their mouth and throat. Painful, but not deadly. But being a college-eduCated, suicidal moron, you wrapped it in gel caps or gum. Which left no trace but burned a hole in your intestine. But the body can repair almost anything, which is cool. In your case, scar tissue closed up the hole but it also formed a bridge between a vein and an artery. Now, veins are supposed to help the intestine flush bacteria away, but the bridge allowed the bacteria entrance to the artery. Where they got a free ride! Everywhere."
Can you fix me?,Surgery to fix the bridge will take about 2 hours. Psychotherapy is going to take a little longer. Why'd you do it?
"I don't know. I've just! nEver been happy. Please don't tell my parents. They'll blame themselves and it's not their fault. Please, you can't tell them.","Technically, all you have to do is promise me that you wont do it again. Then, legally I can't tell them."
I promise.,"Yeah, sure."
We can't thank you...,"Your daughter tried to kill herself. That's why she's here. Legally, I'm supposed to keep that between me and her. Which makes sense, she's obviously an adult, capable of her own well-reasoned decisions."
You're sure?,"If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours, yeah, I'm right."
How could she hide this?,Everyone has secrets.
"We'll take care of her, figure it out.",You'll make her happy?
We'll get her into therapy.,"Might want to try some meds, too."
Can we call you? If we have any questions?,No.
I didn't think you were going to show.,Sorry. Surgery went a little late.
So you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?,I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What have you got there?
Peppermint tea.,I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea please.
"This isn't a job interview, is it?","It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you."
You have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.,"I'm on antidepressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable. I don't like them they make me hazy. I eat meat, I like drugs, and I'm not always faithful to the women I date."
You don't seem depressed.,You do realise you just skipped over sEveral deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from?
You told the truth.,"Yeah... I don't always do that, either."
"Well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around and doing drugs?",Were you on the Debating team in high school? Also... I hate tea.
I hate this... kid.,I like this kid.
You haven't met him.,I know you hate him. What more do I need to know? The kid's not a clichï¿½. Anybody can get into a fight after losing. It takes real creativity to beat up someone you just beat.
Nate went mEdieval on the other kid. Could be...,Hold on. I'm having a moment. This... this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.
Which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.,But not the personality disorder.
There is no personality disorder. He's a teenager.,"Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate? He's having cluster headaches. PRobably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?"
"If it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.",ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular pRoblem.
"Normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him. He's still in pain. Which means...",Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,Don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.
I thought I was a bad mother. And I hated myself. Because I hated him.,What do you got for me this...
What do you got for me this...,... fine morning?
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.,You accusing the symptoms of lying?
Could be hemochromatosis.,Wouldn't account for the personality disorder.
What about hypothyroidism?,"He's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver."
What about ruptured dermoid cyst?,Sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right. It's Foreman's turn to be shot down.
The thing that Cameron said.,Way to think outside the box.
Way to think outside the box.,But no fat in the ventricles. It's cluster headaches.
Normal treatment didn't work. Abnormal treatment didn't work.,"Good point, Foreman!"
"Good point, Foreman!",The treatments don't always work. Symptoms nEver lie.
The only approved treatment left for cluster headaches is brain surgery. And that's not Even a guarantee.,"Back off, Foreman!"
"Back off, Foreman!","If the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment."
Hey!,Something on your mind?
Something on your mind?,Because you totally can't tell.
I had a job interview lined up at New York Mercy yesterday.,Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.
"Didn't happen, because apparently I called to cancel. I don't remember making that call. You think I have neurological issue?",Yes.
Why are you jerking me around?,It wasn't me.
"Yeah! It was one of the other petty, socially repressed asses I work for.",Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.
"If you want me to stay, tell me you want me to stay.",Would it matter?
"No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.","If the adult way doesn't work, why bother with it?"
"I've been totally professional! Gave two weeks notice, continued to work cases! Scheduled my interviews on my own time! You have no right to screw with my future.","You're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?"
"You're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?",It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.,I only sabotage people I consider worth it.
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.,"You are one evil,... cunning Woman. It's a massive turn-on."
"You are one evil,... cunning Woman. It's a massive turn-on.",You girls can gossip later.
What are you talking about?,You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.
You called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.,"When I said, ""You girls can gossip later,"" I was throwing you out, but in a polite way."
"Well, I take it you're off your antidepressants.","Ah, you're deflecting. Only I'm allowed to do that."
Does Foreman actually think I did that?,"No, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it."
Why would I do it?,Do you want him to leave?
No.,Were you planning on doing something?
I'm waiting for board approval.,"But if he takes the job, there's nothing to be done. You had to stop him."
What are you doing?,"Looking for a tell. Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips."
Send in Nurse Unger when you pass her on your way out.,Oh! Almost forgot. I need to give a sixteen-year-old magic mushrooms to treat a cluster headache. Is that cool?
I was being sarcastic.,Wouldn't look that way in the court transcript. Mushrooms have psilocybins that work on cluster headaches. It's either that or cutting into his brain and going on a fishing expedition.
I assume you've considered he could have a psychogenic experience. Possibly suffer a fit of sEvere paranoia.,"Well, I have now. Yeah, it's definitely better that the Dean of Medicine prescribes it instead of an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use. Takes the stink off if the Patient decides to put on a cape and fly off the roof."
And make sure the mother signs off on it.,"Party on, Garth. And don't stand in Foreman's way. It's just wrong."
His other secondary sexual characteristics are normal.,"If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles."
"If you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles.","Thanks. Focus on phrases like ""You were right about the cluster headaches."""
But wrong about what caused them. Vascular pRoblem in a major artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.,"Okay, what causes rage, headaches, personality disorder and hypogonadism?"
Where's Foreman?,He's mad at me.
Why?,No reason.
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Male genitals are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. We're not talking about Foreman anymore.
The kid's being pummeled at school. A couple blows to the head could cause hypothalamic lesions. We Ever gonna talk about what happens when Foreman's gone?,"If this were an employee-owned airline in Scandinavia, yes. It's not lesions. His temperature would be all over the map. Symptoms don't lie."
Doesn't Even need to. The two of us can handle it. Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.,Biopsy the brat's pituitary. And let the record show I was right about the cluster headaches.
His liver's operating at about twenty percent and deteriorating fast.,"Which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his Parking pass. So, what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah-blah-blah, and liver failure?"
"Liver failure can cause hypogonadism, head pain. Altered mental status leads to the personality disorder and rage. All we need to do is figure out what caused the liver failure.","Yes. Also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday can be caused by liver failure today."
"If his liver's failing now, it wasn't great yesterday. If it wasn't operating at capacity, it could have caused...",Ooh-aah! Whoa!
Ooh-aah! Whoa!,Don't sneak up on a person like that.
I'm listening.,"Well, listening doesn't help me. Okay. Let's go with the liver and a time-maParkne theory. Foreman, what causes liver pRoblems?"
Could be a narrowing of the bile ducts. Primary sclerosingcholangitis.,Most liver damage begins with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?
His mother would also be sick.,Cuddy?
Cuddy?,Sounded like someone with back. Go.
Sounded like someone with back. Go.,"We'll try and muddle through without your blank stare to guide us. So if it's not the bad things he's putting in, what about the good things?"
He was raised a vegetarian.,Was raised. Means he's all grown up. Or he's not a vegetarian anymore.
"Unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow, his body would have no pRoblem metabolizing it.","Would if he had an OTC deficiency. Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver. Run a hamburger test."
"Would if he had an OTC deficiency. Body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver. Run a hamburger test.","It's exactly what it sounds like. Stuff him full of meat, wait for his ammonia lEvels to spike."
I thought it would be fun to work on my boat with him.,And you went shirtless because... skin cancer looks cool.
"I'm not too worried about that. It's these white marks, you know?",Lie down.
"I mean, that boat has all sorts of, uh, lead paint, and there's... chemicals Everywhere.","When daddy works on his boat, does he have a cooler with lots of brown bottles with long necks?"
"When daddy works on his boat, does he have a cooler with lots of brown bottles with long necks?",And does daddy like to lie down on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?
Oh! What-what the hell?!,"I will give you this for the... one dollar, forty one cents in your pocket."
"Wait, how could you know...?",A psyParkc once told me that I'm psyParkc.
A psyParkc once told me that I'm psyParkc.,"Hey, one of these quarters is Canadian. Give me back my syringe."
Liver's properly converting the ammonia into urea. He doesn't have OTC deficiency.,Welcome back.
Sorry. I shouldn't have been taking my pRoblems out on the Patient.,Or on me. Apology accepted. Starve him.
And what are we looking for?,Diabetic steatosis would screw up his liver. Starve him overnight and see if his blood sugar pops.
"We mess with his blood sugar, we could set off another rage.",Not a pRoblem. You can take him.
He's on dialysis. He's gonna need it for the rest of his life.,"Which is shortening as we speak. We are looking at a Parknese menu, and we've got symptoms from too Many columns. They're going to overcharge us."
Ten percent of males in this country have elevated...,So we're only gonna pay attention to _abnormal_ abnormalities?
Could be hepatic fibrosis or MCADD. Brat's got a genetic disorder.,Get the sequencing primers. See if it's one of the ones we can treat.
"I can draw some blood, but then I gotta run.",Job interview?
You gonna stop me if it is?,"You do the nurse stuff, they'll do the doctor stuff."
But it's a partial deficiency. So it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.,Yes. Those are the two options. It is... or it isn't.
"If he had Kelley-Seegmiller, he wouldn't just be aggressive, he'd be self-mutilating. Chewing his lips, banging his head.","Lovely disease. Degenerative, fatal, incurable. I wonder if that's why Cameron's on the ""not"" side."
"His vegetarian diet could have limited the purines in his system, slowing the disease's progress.",So let's speed it up.
Why?,"So you two kids will stop fighting. Also, I don't feel like waiting for respiratory failure. Chase, find some way for the mother to get lost for a while. I'm going to stress this kid until he bites off a finger."
They move me to geriatrics? Who are you?,Dr. McCaney. The Man who's gonna kick your ass all over this chessboard.
"Yeah, well, I'm too weak to...","...bite yourself, yeah. You need some liquid energy."
"...bite yourself, yeah. You need some liquid energy.","Now, if you consent, I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline."
Oww! I don't wanna play.,"Aside from being indicative of pituitary issues and certain kinds of genetic disorders, small testicles also indiCate... that you're a big Parkcken. Please don't make me do the sound effect."
You're not gonna goad me into playing.,Didn't think I'd have to. Thought you'd just jump at the chance of humiliating someone.
Age before cripple. I'm white.,It... is... on!
It... is... on!,Bird's opening. Passive approach.
Bird's opening. Passive approach.,Sign of a coward.
Sicilian defense. Sign of an idiot.,Arrogance has to be earned.
Arrogance has to be earned.,Tell me what you've done to earn yours.
I can walk.,I don't bleed out of my penis.
I don't bleed out of my penis.,Check.
Check.,"You know, it's a real thin line between tortured genius and awkward kid who can't get girls because he's... creepy."
Why are you doing this?,To stress you out.
To stress you out.,Check.
"Yeah, but why?","I'd tell you, but I figure it's more stressful if you don't know why."
Not feeling too stressed.,"You know that no one likes you, right?"
"Yeah, well, anybody like you?",You're dying.
You're dying.,Check.
Check.,Your move.
You can't win. You can pin my queen. My knight to E7. Your king to H8. Sacrifice rook takes pawn. Bishop blocks. Queen to H5. Checkmate. Save what's left of your dignity. Lay down your king.,Crap.
Crap.,He's having a seizure. Four milligrams IV Lorazepam.
Right away.,I hate this kid.
I like this kid.,You get the job?
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.,"So we've got one more symptom, one less diagnosis. I assume they're gonna call for references? You give 'em my name?"
Wouldn't alter his personality.,Whose name did you give?
My last boss.,Ouch! That can't look good. I hate this kid.
What if we're not dealing with one condition? What if it's multiple conditions?,"Uh-uh, it's gotta be one. It's always one."
"I don't know, because he's... evil?",What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?
What if he is? What if the symptoms lied?,"There. Now all we're looking at is a simple, evil jerk with Amyloidosis."
You're not being objective.,Amyloidosis was your idea.
"You were right, it doesn't fit the symptoms.","Yeah, it does. Look."
You crossed it off because you wanna hate the kid. And you can't hate him if he's a victim...,"You want him to be a victim because you wanna beliEve that people are good. And if they're not, it's gotta be a chemical pRoblem. Except they're not, and it's not. Flush him with immunosuppressants. Get a biopsy to confirm, and find him a marrow donor."
Nerve biopsy was clean. No evidence of Amyloidosis.,It was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.
"He's running a fEver. If it's two conditions, one of them's gotta be an infection. We should start him on antibiotics, see what clears up, what doesn't.",Is he having trouble breathing?
"Yeah, he has mucus in his chest from an infection.","Could also be an Amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses."
"Could also be an Amyloid buildup. Keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.","Look, you got two choices. Engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked."
"Look, you got two choices. Engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked.",You're not ready.
You're not ready.,"There was a third choice. Don't do what I asked. You coulda defied me, stuck the kid on antibiotics. But you didn't. Because you still trust my judgment more than your own."
"You sabotaged Foreman's job interview, didn't you?",Foreman's already been over this. It wasn't me.
"Everybody's chasing ghosts over this. Which means either nobody did it, or somebody wants Everybody chasing ghosts. Now, who does that sound like?",And why would I do that?
"Because as long as Foreman thought you were guilty, he was gonna be useless around here.","You know, sometimes I forget why I hired you."
You cost him a good opportunity and gained nothing.,I cost him a crappy opportunity. New York Mercy's where you go to treat boils and cysts and build a 401K.
"If you want him to stay, tell him.",I don't and there'd be no point.
You do. And the point would be to make him feel like he's wanted.,He doesn't need that.
Talk to Foreman.,We dumped one symptom. But forgot to add one.
We dumped one symptom. But forgot to add one.,"REvenge time, Nate."
Are you...?,Yes! I am. Black or white?
He doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.,"Pick one, or... this comes out. And, for all you know, this is really important."
Stop it!,"That hurts, right? Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this. You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb."
"That hurts, right? Which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this. You hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb.",Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.
Because your bones have formed abnormally. Thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.,"Actually, this stuff isn't important at all."
Your doctors said he needs immunosuppressants.,They're idiots. It's not Amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.
They're idiots. It's not Amyloidosis. It's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.,"The body absorbs iron from food, but can't process it."
Through the blood vessels. Large quantities of iron deposit along the walls as red blood cells flow overhead.,"Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process."
"Can't get rid of it. And idle iron is the devil's playground. It builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.",Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.
Caused all of the symptoms. Including something that wasn't a symptom.,"Those body aches, they were not from the fighting."
His personality issues?,Sorry. The iron's innocent on that count. Your kid's a jerk.
Sorry. The iron's innocent on that count. Your kid's a jerk.,"And, yeah, it's pRobably your fault. Although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less... almost dead."
"And, yeah, it's pRobably your fault. Although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less... almost dead.","Oh, nurse!"
"Oh, nurse!",This Patient is bleeding for some reason.
Is he going to be okay?,He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained Every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.
He'll need dialysis. And he'll have to get his blood drained Every few months for the rest of his life. My condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.,"I wouldn't have taken your bishop. I'd have moved my queen to D6, defusing the threat. Then rook to E8, attacking the king's pawn. I'd have lost the exchange, but won the game."
I was bluffing. And that's why... you lost.,Jerk.
"You just here to watch, or you got something to say?",Still running the new biopsy for Amyloidosis?
Yeah. Still nothing.,Run the test again. Recheck your results.
Run the test again. Recheck your results.,Looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
You don't answer your phone anymore.,"I'm world famous now, press won't leave me alone."
It's Cuddy.,I know. If it was the press I'd be answering.
"And since you're not taking her calls, I am. Your Patient's been waiting for hours.",She didn't book an appointment.
"No, she risked her life.","You don't reach terra firma, you don't get any milk or Honey."
"The Woman has 10 different things wrong with her, including pains all over her body. Admittedly not as interesting as staring uselessly at Foreman.",You know why I find the goodbye party fascinating? Isn't it kind of insulting to celebrate when someone leaves you?
What are you going to do to keep him?,Nothing.
"He really is going to leave, you know that right?",Yeah.
So what are you going to do?,"Nothing I can do. He doesn't want more money, better working conditions, doesn't Even want a better job. He wants to not be me."
Because he thinks you're a cold-hearted bastard without any regard for anyone but yourself.,He's right.
You need to show him that you really do care.,Don't. Foreman's not the only chocolate-covered cherry in the box.
"House, you play a guitar you got in 9th grade.",8th.
"You're living in the same apartment for 15 years. You drive a 10-yr-old car, you are not good with change.","That used to be true, but I changed."
It all fits as long as these symptoms started when you think it started.,This would be a lot easier if we had her medical records. Any of you certified deep sea divers?
"She's from a dirt poor country in the tropics, infectious disease and parasites are the most likely cause of unexplained pain, fEver and skin rash, we might as well start there.",If there's one thing Castro knows is how to look great in green. And if there are two things Castro knows is how to look great in green and train doctors. Even without the medical records we can assume she was drowned in antibiotics before she risked drowning to see me.
So what doesn't Castro know?,"How to lay his hands on high-tech scanning equipment. Pain, double vision, point us towards the head. Cameron get an MRI, see what's cooking in the old cabeza. Chase, check out the husband."
Why? He hasn't complained of any pain.,"Basic math, take all her symptoms, subtract his sea symptoms, the remainder equals her original symptoms."
"The husband has a pulled muscle in his shoulder but none of the pains or double vision. He does have a fEver, fungal rash, cough and elevated bilirubin. Foreman's not going anywhere.",He said that to you?
"He doesn't really want to leave, and you don't really want to let him. You'll cave, just like you did with Cameron.","Foreman's not as easy as Cameron, but of course, who is?"
He may not want a date but he does want... something.,Maybe it's something I can't offer.
Then you'll just lie.,He'd see through it.
"We could do that, or we could do something productive, start her on interferon for the MS, see if she improves.","I do like being productive. Well done, do it."
Well done? Is that what you think he wants? A pat on the head?,Go do your job.
Does this hurt?,Wow. Well either Foreman's way stronger than he thinks he is or... seriously or?
Cancer's a long shot.,"Why? Because metastatic tumours don't explain the abnormal MRI, kidney damage, cotton mouth, double vision? Oh wait, they do."
Infection could do all that too.,It's not an infection.
Because you know the non-existent medical records confirm that the brilliant doctors in Cuba treated her for infection? Or because you're trying to kiss up to Foreman?,Because an infection would cause a fEver and the brilliant doctors who work in my office have already crossed that off the list because the husband--
"Right, and then you said we should do something productive like breaking her arm?",Foreman didn't break her arm.
Of course he didn't.,"Cancer did. Put her on a PET scan, see what else is breaking."
"This isn't going to work! He's not a moron, you can't just agree with Everything he says for two days and hope he forgets the last three years and how much he hates you!","Anything else? When you get the results for the PET scan, let me know."
I don't really care if Foreman stays or goes but--,You're fired.
Wha... what because I yelled at you?,"Because you've been here the longest, learned all you can, or you haven't learned anything at all... either way, it's time for a change."
Why'd you fire Chase?,"Sure thing, first you tell me the results of the PET scan."
Did you fire him for me?,Would you stay if I did?
No!,Yes.
You're frustrated with Foreman so you lash out? Kick the dog?,He's not gone 5 minutes and the name-calling starts. What's on the PET scan?
Why'd you fire Chase?,Do you know what's on the PET scan?
You two out.,"Woah, wait! What's on the PET scan?"
You can't dump your entire department just because you don't know how to deal with an issue.,"Yes, they are all irreplaceable. If only this country had figured out somehow to teach people to interpret PET scans."
What the hell is wrong with you? You fired Chase?,I don't suppose you know what's on my Patient's PET scan?
"I told you to show Foreman you have a heart, how does that translate to you being a bastard?",So that's a no?
"Pick up the phone, and tell Chase you made a mistake. Un-fire him.","Chase. If you know what's on the PET scan, call me back."
Chase is a good doctor.,"Sorry, you're in the wrong room. My name on the door, my team, my decisions."
"My building, my floor, my people.","Hold that repriMand. House. Doctor Chase, how are ya? Thank you, you are indispensable. Um, you're still fired, sorry. Wow, that was awkward. PET scan rEvealed a blood clot in my Patient's arm which means goodbye. Still got 2 people working for me, got to get one of them to do my job."
Because it's the truth.,Did you give an angry Cuban my home number?
She's in v-tach.,What did you do?
It hurts.,She has no pulse but she's talking. Cough.
She has no pulse but she's talking. Cough.,"Cough again. Keep coughing, it'll push blood into your head, keep you conscious. Push 1 mg epinephrine."
Will that help?,"No, but it is amazingly cool."
We need to put her on bypass.,"We need to keep her here, if this is a clot then forcing a bypass will blow it into her brain and kill her."
If we continue CPR she'll lose blood flow which will cause brain damage.,What would cause the heart to stop? Let's assume it wasn't huMan error.
"I didn't nick an artery, it just stopped.",Which is why I said assume.
No ST segment changes. We need to tell the husband.,Tell him what? We have no idea what happened.
House?,Keep going 'til I figure this out.
"Geez, 47 I hope my colon looks better than this guy's. Isolating the first transverse...",Help! I'm trapped inside a monitor!
"Not a good time, House.",My Patient lost her heartbeat during a routine cardiac catheterisation so--
HuMan error.,It's not huMan error.
Electrical instability?,"Pre-procedure EKG was normal, no syncope."
Ischemia?,Foreman said no ST segment changes.
HuMan error is the only other possible--,It's not huMan error.
"Of course it's huMan error, you don't want Foreman to have made a mistake because then you'd have to mock him, and that would put a crimp in your brilliant plan of keeping him by having a breakdown and firing Chase.",Did you just spin on the monitor? You know I can't see you. HuMan error would not explain her symptoms.
You mean her heart stopping?,"I mean her foot pain, her back pain..."
"House, I'm busy. You have a team, run your differential with them.",Foreman and Cameron are doing CPR.
HuMan behaviour finals will also get into clinical presentations of Mania and we'll touch on Stanislas Dehaene's PET scans.,"Excuse me, professor."
"House, when we're done with our rounds-",My Patient has no heartbeat. Stopped when we inserted a catheter during a routine angiogram. Anyone tells me why her heart stopped gets an A in doctor Cuddy's class.
Anyone?,"Yeah, I'm polling first year medical students because I hadn't considered huMan error."
"Yeah, I'm polling first year medical students because I hadn't considered huMan error.","Structural abnormalities would show up on the echo, you get a C."
"Structural abnormalities would show up on the echo, you get a C.",F.
F.,"B+. Unfortunately, she missed her last botox appointment due to a boating accident, but send me your resume."
"House, time's up.","Good lord, you smell like muskox."
Your Patient isn't already on bypass?,I was worried about a clot.
Doctor House?,You can vacuum later.
"I am not the janitor; I am Esteban Hernandez, what happened to my wife?",Her heart stopped.
Why did her heart stop?,"If I knew that, I'd be coming to you."
Tell me where you take her. Tell me what has happen to her.,"Happening. Present participle. Not a particularly interesting form of speech, kind of like of this conversation."
"But... I risk my life to see you. I look you up, you fix people. When Everyone else gives up, you don't and now you insult me? Ignore my wife?",Helps my process.
"No, you do not ignore my wife, ok? She is Everything to me.",Well then you do not ignore your wife.
"Turn on the bypass please. Good, good distal flow.",Need to look at the heart.
Why?,"Can't find my wallet. Pick it up, turn it over."
I don't see anything physically wrong with her heart.,Hearts don't stop for no reason.
"Ok, take your look. Do you see anything wrong?",Give her a jump start.
Clear. Clear. Clear.,"And again,"
Clear. Clear. Clear.,Again.
"Yeah, 7th time is the charm. Sorry, I'll keep her on bypass until the husband has a chance to say goodbye.",I'm not telling her husband anything until I can tell him why his wife--
I will miss you.,"Can I have a hug too? Surgeon found nothing, can't start her heart. What a thoughtful gift. Nice reminder of intellectual theft to hang at your new place of employment. You two can go, say hi to Chase for me. You're wearing lipstick."
We can stay. We can run another differential.,"You two have no theories about why the heart stopped. Which means I don't need you, go."
It's too late for theories; we need to tell the husband.,Tell him what?
That it's over.,Why?
Because her heart won't start!,"How can we tell him there's no hope if we don't know why there's no hope? He's not going to pull the plug on his wife, he risked his life to get her to me. If he pulls the plug it means he's failed."
If he pulls the plug it means you failed.,And you're ok with that? Go.
How's it going?,The way the security light hits your legs... looks good.
Thank you.,"If you're here to yell at me about the Foreman-Chase situation, it can wait."
When do you plan on telling the husband it's time to say goodbye to his wife?,Haven't put a clock on it.
"Other than your curiosity, do you have any reason to keep her on bypass?",Patient's husband prefers her not dead.
Well you're on a storybook ending for the young Man who crossed the ocean for his wife.,"This is not an act, I don't care if--"
Then pull the plug.,What if I can fix it? Maybe I just don't know it yet.
I know you care--,"I don't care. I really don't care. My motives are pure - if we do an autopsy, you'll see... oops... if I'd thought of that crazy idea, we could have saved her. And then the husband might be upset."
You've done all you can do. It's time to let go.,I was told you didn't beliEve in God.
"I don't. I promised my wife I do Everything I can to fix her, if I don't pray, then I don't do Everything.","It's not working, she's not coming back. If you want to say goodbye, come down to the ICU, then I'll take her off bypass. I'm sorry, I should've--"
"Marina, I am so sorry. When you turn the maParkne off, that's it?",Yeah.
Right now is her brain working?,PRobably. Just not her heart.
She seems like she's just sleeping.,"She's not sleeping, we double-checked."
Her heart... beat.,"No, it's residual flow from the bypass."
"That is her heart, no?","QRST wave, that's a normal normal."
Marina.,Holy crap.
Is this heaven?,"No, it's New Jersey."
God send you back to me. It's a miracle.,It's impossible.
Apparently not.,Live hearts don't stop for no reason. Dead hearts don't start for no reason.
She's 3 hours off bypass and still stable. And the pain is gone.,No it's not.
You think she's lying about feeling better?,Just 'coz it's not there now doesn't mean it's gone.
"Just because it was there before doesn't mean it's coming back. Chase was pRobably right, she had some sort of tropical infection that cleared when we put her on antibiotics during the bypass.",Antibiotics did not bring her back to life.
"Other than a miracle, it's the only explanation for her symptoms.",How come God gets credit whenEver something good happens? Where was he when her heart stopped? What if it wasn't huMan error? What if it was God's error? A congenital defect in an artery making it susceptible to inflammation. We need to do another angiogram.
"We've looked at her heart a hundred different ways, there was no evidence--",The one time we looked inside her heart we stopped before we could see anything.
Because it stopped.,"Good news, we think we know what the pRoblem is."
You mean was.,"Hey, it's my first language, not yours. If she wants to outlive Castro, we need to fix her heart."
Que es lo que quiere?,"In case no one's filled you in, today is Monday, which means you've been dead for a day. That kind of symptom comes back it can get serious. I need to do another angiogram."
"Wait, wasn't that what caused her heart to stop before?","No, God caused that. He's all powerful you know."
"Si, lo es. He was watParkng over us in the ocean and he's watParkng over us now.","Your rescuers didn't have wings, they had a helicopter."
Esteban prayed,"You know how Many little boys are praying for jet packs? How Many priests are praying for... uhh, that one actually works."
You didn't bring me back to him,"I'm not going to take you away from him but if we don't do this test, God will."
"You said there was no chance, no hope, which means--","Which means I was wrong. But I'm wrong all the time, my mistakes don't prove there's a God. You came a long way to see me, you going to put her life in God's hands or in mine?"
"Which means I was wrong. But I'm wrong all the time, my mistakes don't prove there's a God. You came a long way to see me, you going to put her life in God's hands or in mine?",Ready?
Ready?,"I better not see you praying! I don't want to have to fight for credit on this. Exiting the femoral, entering the aortic arch."
This is where--,Where we stopped to have a picnic last week.
Her blood pressure's rising.,"Mine's rising too, 'course I am doing battle with a deity. In the heart, injecting the dye."
Looks like you're wrong.,"Either I'm right, or this test is about to go very bad."
What's that?,"She has one... two... third ostium. How Many is she supposed to have? Dos. All the third one's doing is causing inflammation, throwing off clots, giving away the angiogram. No huMan would screw up that big! Don't worry, just one more surgery and you'll be fine."
Thank god.,Don't make me slap you.
I hear you got another satisfied customer.,One more and I get a set of steak knives.
"Well, this is it. I appreciate the opportunity you gave me.","Didn't do it for you, thought you were the best guy for the job."
"Thanks, I guess.","Which is why I want you to stay. You're an important part of the team, I need you."
"I know. But I don't need you, and I definitely don't want to be you. You're miserable.","I just solved a case by predicting a nEver before seen heart defect, a case you couldn't solve, a case you gave up on; I couldn't be happier."
"For 2 minutes maybe, until the next case comes along, until you're jonesing for your next fix. This Woman talks while in full cardiac arrest and you're more excited about the talking than the heart dying.",The two were connected.
"I don't want to solve cases, I want to save lives.",Do you think she cares? Do you think the husband cares? Do you think the Parkldren she can now have because of me are going to care why I saved her?
I care.,About yourself. About your own ego!
House.,"You're the selfish bastard, not me. It's why you took so much pleasure in drawing out this little goodbye of yours for the last 3 weeks, wasn't for me, wasn't for anyone, sure as hell didn't help anyone."
Nice try.,Nice tries are worthless.
Nice tries are worthless.,"You now have a bigger office than I do, why don't you go enjoy it."
"You now have a bigger office than I do, why don't you go enjoy it.",Better be naked pictures.
I've gotten all I can from this job.,What do you expect me to do? Break down and apologise? Beg Chase to come back?
"No, I expect you to do what you always do. I expect you to make a joke and go on. I expect you to be just fine. I'll miss you.","Genuine American cigars, you guys can't get them in Cuba, one hundred percent healthy."
Shouldn't you go home?,"Patient follow-up, very important."
"Patient follow-up, very important.","She looks great, like she's sleeping."
"She is sleeping, I double-check. So, they all quit.","Two of them quit, I fired the third."
It's very hard to lose your people. Must be very upset.,"Yeah, I must be."
But you're not.,I don't think I am. I think I'm okay.
What are you going to do?,God only knows.
"29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.",See that? They all assume I'm a Patient because of this cane.
So put on a white coat like the rest of us.,I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.
You see where the administration might have a pRoblem with that attitude.,People don't want a sick doctor.
Fair enough. I don't like healthy Patients. The 29 year old female!,"The one who can't talk, I liked that part."
She's my cousin.,"And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis. I wouldn't either. Brain tumor, she's gonna die, boring."
No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.,You're the oncologist; I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.
"Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.",She's 29. WhatEver she's got is highly unlikely.
Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.,That's an HMO lab; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.
No family history.,I thought your uncle died of cancer.
Other side. No environmental factors.,That you know of.
And she's not responding to radiation treatment.,None of which is Even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?
It's a lesion.,And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.
Shouldn't we be speaking to the Patient before we start diagnosing?,Is she a doctor?
"No, but!",Everybody lies.
Isn't treating Patients why we became doctors?,"No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating Patients is what makes most doctors miserable."
So you're trying to eliminate the huManity from the practice of medicine.,"If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. HuManity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor."
"First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think ""horses"" not ""zebras"".","Are you in first year of medical school? No. First of all, there's nothing on the CAT scan. Second of all, if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it nEver gets near this office. Differential diagnosis, people: if it's not a tumor what are the suspects? Why couldn't she talk?"
"Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.",Get her a contrast MRI.
Mad cow?,Mad zebra.
Wernickie's encephalopathy?,"No, blood thiamine lEvel was normal."
"Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.",Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.
I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.,"Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago."
You think we have nothing to talk about?,"No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in."
I sign your paychecks.,"I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?"
I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.,I'm here from 9 to 5.
Your billings are practically nonexistent.,Rough year.
You ignore requests for consults.,I call back. Sometimes I misdial.
You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.,"See, I was right, this doesn't interest me."
"6 years, times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.",It's 5:00. I'm going home.
To what?,Nice.
"Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.","Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me."
Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.,"Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, ""You can't always get what you want."""
"Dr. Cameron. I'm sorry I have to stop you, there's a pRoblem.",You pulled my authorization.
"Yes, why are you yelling?","No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs."
You also can't make long distance phone calls.,If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.
Or photocopies; you're still yelling.,I'm ANGRY! You're risking a Patient's life.
I assume those are two separate points.,"You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have!"
"Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, ""You can't always get what you want,"" but as it turns out ""if you try sometimes you get what you need.""","So, because you want me to treat Patients, you aren't letting me treat Patients."
I need you to do your job.,"Do the MRI, she folded. I've gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I've missed. 2054. I'll be caught up in 2054. You better love this cousin a whole lot."
Just get some rest for now.,"Told you, can't trust people."
"She pRobably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.","Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words."
You actually want me to talk to the Patient? Get a history?,We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.
I thought Everybody lied?,Truth begins in lies. Think about it.
"That doesn't mean anything,does it?","12:52 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes."
"No TV, but we've got Patients.",Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.
I made sure your first case was an interesting one.,"Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color."
Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.,I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Patient is orange.,The color?
"No, the fruit.",You mean yellow; it's jaundice.
I mean orange.,"Well, how orange?"
What's that? What are you doing?,Painkillers.
"Oh, for you, for your leg.","No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better."
"No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.","Unfortunately, you have a deeper pRoblem. Your wife is having an affair."
What?!,"You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?"
"You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?","The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer."
"The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer.",Deep breath.
It's cold.,Has he been using his inhaler?
What happened to your leg?,"Your doctor pRobably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too. She pRobably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing. Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years, don't you think? Ok, I'm gonna assume that no body's Ever told you what asthma is, or if they have, you had other things on your mind. A stimulant triggers cells in your Parkld's airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract. Mucus production increases, cell-lining starts to shed. But the steroids, the steroids!stop the inflammation. The more often this happens!"
"What? ""The more often this happens!""what?""","Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors."
You couldn't have knocked?,"Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone."
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.,So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.
"That could mean anything, or nothing.","Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be."
You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.,"Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right."
And if we're wrong?,We learn something else.
Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.,It's not the parrot.
Psitticosis can lead to nerve pRoblems and neurological complications.,How Many kids were there in the class?
20,How Many are home sick?
"None, but!","None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You've been through her home?"
She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.,Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?
It's not a crime scene.,Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.
She's a kindergarten teacher!,"And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly. Ok, I'll give you a for instance. The lady back there, who made your egg-salad sandwich. Her eyes look glassy, did you notice that? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you're sick, but if you're making $8.00 an hour, then ya kinda need the $8.00 an hour right? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities, but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleEve isn't hyper concerned about sanitary conditions. So what do ya think? Should I trust her? I want you to check the Patient's home for contaminants, garbage, medication!"
"Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's House.","Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home? Yeah, I know, court records are sealed, you were 16, it was a stupid mistake, but your old gym teacher has a big mouth. You should write a thank you note."
I should thank him?,"Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you're being conned, knows how to con."
I should sue you!,I'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's House.,I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?
Why are you giving Adler steroids?,"Well, she's my Patient that's what you do with Patients. You give them medicine."
You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.,You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.
I'm stopping the treatment.,She's my Patient.
It's my hospital.,"I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her."
With no proof.,There's nEver any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.
You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?,"I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?"
Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes people die.,Come on.
Come on.,People used to have more respect for cripples you know! They didn't really.
Right.,"Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?"
You got lucky.,"Cool, huh?"
"Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind perManently, and then the respiratory center will fail.",How long do we have?
"If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll pRobably be fastest of all, maybe a week.",We're gonna stop all treatment.
"Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.","No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what."
So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?,"Yeah, we're gonna watch her die. Specifically we're gonna watch how fast she's dying. You just told us, each diagnosis has its own timeframe. When we see how fast it's killing her we'll know what it is."
"There's go to be something we can do, something better than watParkng her die.","Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?"
I'm tired a lot.,Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?
It's kinda the definition isn't it?,It's kinda the definition of getting older.
"I had a couple headaches last month, mild fEver, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.",Apparently not while researParkng this stuff on the internet.
I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.,Excellent diagnosis !
Is there anything for that?,"Ya know, I think there just might be."
"Ya know, I think there just might be.","I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar."
Nothing.,It's not a tumor; she's getting worse too fast. She can't stand up.
Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.,You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?
"Yes, yes, her name is Rebecca. I call her Rachel.",You idiot!
Hey!listen!,"Not you, him! You said you didn't find anything."
Everything I found was in,You found ham.
So?,"Where there's ham there's pork, where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis."
Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?,"It fits. Could have been living there for years, it nEver occurred to me"
Millions of people eat ham Every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.,"OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?"
Just like Rebecca Adler did.,"In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae. They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce."
"Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.","That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go."
Out.,"Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?"
Everywhere.,"As long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't Even know it's there. The worm builds a wall, uses secretions to shut down the body's immune response and control fluid flow. It's really kinda beautiful."
"As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?","It's too late for that. It's dying, and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host's defenses. The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and Everything starts to swell, and that is very bad for the brain."
Proving nothing.,"No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it's perfect! It explains Everything."
But it proves nothing.,I can prove it by treating it.
"No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.","Will you excuse us, please?"
"Will you excuse us, please?",I'm Dr. House.
It's good to meet you.,"You're being an idiot. Ahem. You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend."
Have you actually seen the worm?,When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.
You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a,"I'm not talking about a treatment; I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die."
What made you a cripple?,I had an infarction.
A heart attack?,It's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed. If it's in the heart it's a heart attack. If it's in the lungs it's a pulmonary embolism. If it's in the brain it's a stroke. I had it in my thigh muscles.
Wasn't there something they could do?,"There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death."
Did you think you were dying?,I hoped I was dying.
"So you hide in your office, refuse to see Patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get Even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?","When you're scared, you'll turn into me."
I just want to die with a little dignity.,"There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're Even born, but it always happens and there's nEver any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. You can live with dignity, we can't die with it."
"There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're Even born, but it always happens and there's nEver any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.",No treatment.
"Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.",But she does.
Pretty common result.,That didn't happen here.
"So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?","I solved the case, my work is done."
"I solved the case, my work is done.","Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees."
"I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but!","Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?"
"Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.","Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle. If she's got one in her head I guarantee you there's one in her leg."
Why did you hire me?,Does it matter?
Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.,Why?
Is that rhetorical?,"No, it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer. Does it make a difference why I think I'm a jerk? The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?"
You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.,"No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor!with a juvenile record. I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty."
You hired me to get into my pants?!,"I can't beliEve that that would shock you. It's also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby."
I was in the top of my class.,But not THE top.
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.,"Yes, you were a very good applicant."
But not the best?,"Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?"
I worked very hard to get where I am.,"But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's a law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn't, you worked your stunning little ass off."
Am I supposed to be flattered?,Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?
No!,Sexually assaulted?
No.,"But you are damaged, aren't you?"
She's converted.,You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?
It got you to take the case.,"You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?"
You've nEver lied to me?,I NEveR lie.
He says he needs a refill.,Got change for a dollar?
Hey!,Close the door. Close the door!
Is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?,"She's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she comManded; she just doesn't know I'm alone."
"Well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?",I'm off at 4:00.
You're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?,"I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose. That's 30 seconds looking at the nose; 25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor."
"Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying. Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.",That would be lying.
"And that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.",Not the definition of case though.
"You have no cases. You have NO cases. You've got handpicked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?",Cameron is answering my mail.
Time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?,Research?
Huh,"So, 4:03 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down."
Dr. House.,"Sorry, done for the day. There's plenty of docs here to take care of you."
But we had an appointment.,"Hah, nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic, which means there are no appointments. It means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me."
But your letter says that we would see you.,Not a big letter writer.
Here.,When did my signature get so girly?
I can explain.,"See that ""G"", see how it makes a big loop on top? It doesn't Even look like my handwriting. Think I have something? What's the differential diagnosis for writing ""G's"" like a junior high school girl?"
"It's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called!",PersEverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun. Low-rider jeans are hot.
"16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause. The kid's been to 2 neurologists!","Night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?"
Where are you going?,To see the family.
You're going to examine a Patient?,"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work."
"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.","Margins look fine. No lesions, color is good. How long have you been having night terrors?"
What does that tell you?,"Nothing, it's just fun watParkng him blink. Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter ""B"" go."
Baby elephant.,"Baby elephant is actually a good answer; ""B"" is a bear of a letter."
What does that tell you?,"Proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is nEver going to be Parkef fry cook. In teens there are two likely causes of night terrors: post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?"
No.,"Well, then, Dave!"
Dan,"!if there's no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse. So, who's molesting you? Teacher, extra friendly neighbor? I'd ask if either one of you were involved, but you'd deny it."
We would nEver do anything to hurt Dan.,"I say it here, it comes out there. This lack of response is consistent with abuse."
"There's no one, ok? I swear. There was trauma; I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.",Did you know that he got hit in the head?
"They didn't mention it, no.","Yeah, why bother."
"No, no, we took him to the ER after the game. He was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine. No concussion, it's gotta be something else.","You hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis. Cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion."
I had double vision before I got hit.,"Well, that changes Everything, you need glasses. That's why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors. You need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not."
"You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.","You're an only Parkld, aren't you?"
Why would you say that?,"Everything is about you. This may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad. I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus."
I'm not an only Parkld.,Interesting.
What?,Don't move. Did I bore you in there?
"What? Ah, no, not, not really.",Are you tired?
He nEver sleeps! Of course he's tired.,"Right now, at this moment, are you tired?"
"No, no.",That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
His leg twitched. I don't see what!,"It's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep. Respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up."
So?,"So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Admit him."
"So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Admit him.","I recognize that loopy ""G"". So, what does the jerk tell us?"
"Nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body. Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscle movements.","A movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease. Either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair."
"Maybe not that bad, could be an infection.","You wish. No fEver, no white count. Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?"
I took an accurate family history.,You didn't Even take an accurate family. His father's not his father.
Why would you say that?,30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.
From what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.,That's what our moms would like us to beliEve.
"Who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?",Fifty bucks says I'm right.
I'll take your money.,"Hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy."
"It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad. If we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.","Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier."
Parents said?,"That's a good point. Before we condemn this kid, maybe we should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism. I want a detailed polysomnograph. If he's having night terrors I want to see them."
I usually don't move during night terrors.,I'm not restraining you for them. EEG rEvealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
What are you doing?,Fixing it.
Can I talk to my parents?,"Oh, they know all about this."
I'd really like to see them. Please! I'd really like them here.,"This is gonna hurt, Dan."
"We did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray. All the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.","Ok, but let's pretend there's something and go from there. Who sees something on this MRI?"
No space-occupying tumors.,"He's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain. The smallest thing is abnormal."
Meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.,"Excellent, you see what he did there? He took a small clue that there's a neurological pRoblem and wasn't afraid to run with it."
There's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.,"No, there's not, he's completely wrong."
Then what clue are you talking about?,"He knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess. ClEver, but also pathetic."
"So, what did you find?",Take a close look at the corpus callosum.
It looks ok.,"Are we all looking at the same thing? 200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain. It's subtle."
"There's some bowing, there. An upward arch.",Are you guessing?
Yes.,"Too bad, you're right."
"He pRobably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.","Yeah, he pRobably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position. Something is pushing on it."
If there's bowing it could be a tumor.,Do you see a tumor on this MRI?
"No, but I don't see any bowing, either.","There's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms. Today"
"No more pressure, Everything goes back to normal.",He's lucky to have you as his doctors.
"No formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.",Yummy.
Her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.,"Mmhmm. No fEver, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates."
"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.",Think they don't work?
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work. Pad their bottom line.,Mmmm. May I?
Sure.,"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. All natural, no dyes. That's a good business: all-natural Parkldren's toys. Those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don't lie about how much they spend on research and dEvelopment. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog."

You know another really good business? Teeny tiny baby coffins. You can get them in frog green or fire engine red. Really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you. They think that you'll spend whatEver they ask to keep your kid alive. Want to change things? Prove them wrong. A few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, beliEve me, prices will drop REALLY fast. Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit."
Tell me what she has.,A cold.
There's a pRoblem.,Complications in surgery?
"Surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.",Really?
"Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.",Which means multiple sclerosis. And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
McDonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.,"Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens."
McDonald.,"Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens."
Without the lesions we can't be sure.,"Well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indiCate rapidly progressive MS. Not the fun MS with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs."
We should wait until we,"Start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5. Break it to the family. I'm going home."
I'm not here. Leave a message.,"Dr. Cuddy, great outfit."
What are you doing back here? Patient?,"No, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home."
"Dr. House, Dan's missing.","Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately."
He shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.,"I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache. That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning."
We wanted to keep you informed. He heard some pretty heavy news.,This is not a toddler wandering around a department store. He's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.
"So, when you say ""Call me if you need anything,"" You mean, ""Don't call me.""","No, I mean ""Call me if I can do something."" I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing."
What about his parents? Should we call them?,Why? You think they're hiding him? Make sure someone checks the roof; some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dan! No!,Dr. Foreman. I assume you found the kid.
He almost walked off the roof.,Suicidal?
"No, he thought he was on his lacrosse field. Look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change!",Conscious?
Yeah.,How'd you talk him down?
"Actually, Chase tackled him.",How come you didn't do it?
"Right, well, I am black, but he was closer.","Come on, you can ride up with me."
"Come on, you can ride up with me.",Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
"They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.","Why does Everyone always think I'm being sarcastic? This is great news! He doesn't have MS. The parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway. Of course, the dad pRobably doesn't know!"
Why doesn't he have MS?,"He was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this?"
"Yeah, sure.","He was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS."
That the immune system is working.,"Right, he has an infection in his brain."
What about sex?,"Well, it might get compliCated. We work together. I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that."
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.,"Heh, nice cover."
"Sorry, RPR was negative.",We don't need a definitive test to confirm this.
"Sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.","Ok, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush."
"So the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?","Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%."
I'll start him on IV penicillin.,We're not going to wait for that. The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
"We can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high-volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him. No neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.",Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?
Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,Who thinks there's a third option?
Who thinks there's a third option?,"Very good, what's the third choice?"
"The Patient has a shunt in his brain. There'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.","Excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture."
I wouldn't do that.,"Although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail. Steak knife?"
Wife's nail file.,"Nail File. Yeah, pain'll make you do stupid things. Something to take the edge off?"
Yeah.,Cheers. [Limps back
No.,Here on work?
"No, why are you",Does your penis hurt?
No. What? Should it?,"No, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question. Your Lawyer's gonna love it."
Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.,"You're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?"
Yeah.,"Now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose? It's the free-flowing pus that's the tip-off."
I was in town.,"Not for family, not for work. You drove 70 miles to a walk-in-clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road. Now, either you have a pRoblem with those hospitals, or they have a pRoblem with you. My guess is that you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood, and the rest are now refusing to treat you. It's ironic, isn't it? It's like the boy who sued wolf. You know what? I bet we have a doctor here named Wolfe. How perfect would that be? I'm gonna page him."
"Ok, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.","I didn't say I wouldn't treat you. We'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up."
Why would you do that?,I'm a people person.
You actually treated him?,"All I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them. The cutest little tennis outfit, my God I thought I was going to have a heart attack. Oh my, I didn't see you there, that is so embarrassing."
How's your hooker doing?,"Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that."
I heard you found her on the roof.,You have very acute hearing.
You notify the parents?,"In due course, of course."
And is there a paternity bet on the father of the Patient?,Doesn't sound like me.
"Well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.",You think?
"I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.",My guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
"Fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.","And if I win, no clinic hours for a week."
Penicillin's not working.,"So, either it's a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong. Square one. ""Mignight."""
"LFTs, BUN, and creatinine, are all normal, diabetes is out. No gap.",There goes metabolic.
MRI rules out vasculitis.,"""I"" for inflammation."
Too young for anything degenerative.,"""D"", see ya. ""N"" for neoplastic?"
MRI was clean.,"""I"" for inflammation."
We already did that.,Stupid to have two I's in one mneumonic. What's the other one?
CT scan rules out subdural.,"Trauma, later much. You know the pRoblem? Midnight is actually spelled with a ""G"" and an ""H,"" If we could just figure out what those two letters stand for. It's a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him. Scaring the hell out of him. Get him an EEG, left and right EOG esophageal microphones. If this thing wants to talk, let's listen."

If this thing wants to talk, let's listen.",We're missing something. This is screwed up.
That's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?,"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it."
"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it.","Oh, crap. Another reason I don't like meeting Patients. If they don't know what you look like they can't yell at you. Here we go."
How can you just sit there?,"If I eat standing up, I spill."
"Our son is dying, and you could care less? We're going through hell; you're doing nothing?","I'm sorry, you need to vent, I understand."
Don't be condescending. You haven't checked in on him once.,"Blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads. LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range. Oh yeah, and he's hearing voices. Go hold his hand. Go on; I'll bus your tray."

I don't beliEve you. You're gonna run DNA tests?,"Their son is deathly ill, I know it's terrible, but the fact is if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this I'm afraid I might start to cry."
You're an ass.,Yeah? You want to double the bet?
Yeah? You want to double the bet?,General Hospital is on channel 6.
"Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now, only mush.",No epileptiform activity. What are you doing?
Waiting for CBC and Chem-7.,"Good, run DNA on these."
What's this?,Parents' coffee cups.
I can't beliEve you,"I've had this conversation once already. If you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this."
Dr. House?,"Hey, Mr. Funsten! I was wondering when you'd be back. Got some papers for me?"
You've caused me considerable mental distress.,"I certainly hope so. What? Too cheap to have your Lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?"
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.,You have gonorrhea.
"No, I don't!","Well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do. It could be a false positive; normally I'd run a second test, but since you're here I'll just go with the first."
You're just trying to scare me.,"It's reportable you know, public health issue."
I'll be sure to let my wife know.,"Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you. Look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal. There's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors to run a test."
"Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you. Look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal. There's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors to run a test.",Uh-uh. These are mine now. I'll see you in court.
We need an answer.,You idiots! You lied to me!
Perfect.,Can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs? Theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.
He was adopted. He doesn't need to know.,I do.
Adoption makes him just as much his,"Listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused? Did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition, or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?"
How did you find out about this?,I sampled their DNA.
We didn't give you any DNA.,Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
You can't do that!,"Again, why are we getting hung up on what I did? Your medical history is useless."
"Sounds reasonable. Well, if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice, but I still think it's the wrong","Was she vaccinated? The biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?"
Dan was vaccinated at 6 months.,"Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months? Because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system. So, was she vaccinated?"
"Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months? Because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system. So, was she vaccinated?","An infant picks up a regular old measles virus. He gets a rash, he's extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fEver, but he lives. Here's the kicker, once Every million or so times, the virus mutates. Instead of Dan having a fEver and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb. In this case for 16 years."
Sub-acute Sclerosing Pan-encephalitis.,I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one. Once SSPE moves to stage two,"Boom, stage two is universally fatal."
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.,"He's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight."
Can we treat it?,Ask the neurologist.
We're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.,Tap him.
"We won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after Everything we've given him.","So the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis. Why do people lie to me? It could also kill him. Your ball, Foreman, tell me I don't have to biopsy his brain."
"You can't order a $3,200 DNA test to win a bet.","It's not an actual cost. I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing maParkne."
I'm serious.,"Well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance."
Insurance is not going to pay for a bet.,"It should. If we don't make that bet, the kid dies. If not for the paternity bet, I nEver would have taken their DNA, without their DNA we nEver would have discovered that Dan was adopted, which was the key to this case. You just don't want to pay your end. Big mistake. My guy knows a guy."
Whoo.,"Well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson. Very bitter."
Thanks.,"Wheels, one-eight! Wheels!"
"Oh, Brandon. Brandon, I know I'm good but come on. Brandon, Brandon, Brandon!",Why do you want me to treat this guy?
Blood pressure's not responding to IV fluids.,"No, no I didn't ask how you plan to con me into treating him, I asked you why YOU want me to treat him."
"He's sick, I care, I'm pathetic.","There are about a billion sick people on the planet, why this one?"
Because this one's is in our emergency room.,"Ah, so it's a proximity issue. If somebody was sick in the third floor stairwell that's who we would be talking about."
"Yes, I checked the stairwell, it's clear.","Ok then, emergency room guy it is."
"Wait, how was that so easy?",You know why.
Blood pressure's not responding to IV fluids?,"Yeah, that's just weird."
"Yeah, that's just weird.","CBC was unremarkable, abdominal CT scan didn't show anything. So, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?"
Him.,"Him, her, does it matter? Does anyone think it is a testicular pRoblem? No, so Chase!"
"Nah, but then you wouldn't get the ""","Foreman, if you're going to list all the things it's not, it might be quicker to do it alphabetically. Let's see. Absidia? Excellent. Doesn't account for any of the symptoms."
No condition accounts for all these symptoms.,"Well, good! Because I thought maybe he was sick, but apparently he's not. Who wants to do up the discharge papers? Okay, unless we control the blood pressure, he's going to start circling the drain before we can figure out what's wrong with him. Treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics and I want a cort-stim test and an echocardiogram."
You're half an hour late.,Busy case load.
"One case is not a ""load"".","So, how are we doing on cotton swabs today? If there's an acute shortage I could run home """
"No, you couldn't.","Nice. Hello, sick people and their loved ones! In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring Parkt-chat later, I'm Dr. Gregory House. You can call me Gregg. I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning."
"Short, sweet. Grab a file.","This ray of sunshine is Dr. Cuddy. Dr. Cuddy runs this whole hospital so, unfortunately, she's much too busy to deal with you. I am a bored certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology. I'm also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is here against his will. That is true, isn't it? But not to worry, because for most of you this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin. Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this. This is Vicodin. It's mine. You can't have any. And no, I do not have a pain Management pRoblem, I have a pain pRoblem. But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell. So, who wants me? And who would rather wait for one of the other two doctors? Okay, well, I'll be in Exam Room 1 if you change your mind."
It was yellow.,It was?
It's not any more.,"Hmmm, that's a shame."
"I thought that might be a pRoblem, so I brought you this.",Your mucus was pale goldenrod.
"Last week, yes. Should I be worried?","Oh, yes. Very."
Really? I thought I was okay now.,"And yet, here you are. What happened? Paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?"
"You're not a very nice doctor, are you?",And you are very bad at whatEver it is you do.
You don't Even know me!,"I know you're going to get fired. That's why you got the new glasses, that's why your teeth are sParkly white. You're getting the most of your health insurance while you still can."
I might be quitting.,If you were quitting you would have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod; you're getting fired.
I just don't like being told what to do.,I'll get you in for a full body scan later this week.
"They're having an effect. His BP's falling fast. There's fluid filling his lungs. His creatinine's rising. His kidneys are shutting down. Our treatment isn't making him better, it's killing him.","So, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything, now we have sEven. Who's excited?"
I don't think it compliCates things. The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.,Maybe.
"I thought that's what we dealt with, here. It explains the cardiomyopathy, pain, the low BP, the fEver.","You read the book. Impressive. It's a ludicrously long shot that explains Every one of those symptoms, except for the cough and the rash. Should we just erase those?"
"Well, anything can cause a rash.","Okay. Cardiac infection. Cameron, you thought! allergy? Chase, what was it you thought, carcinoid? And then there's hypothyroidism, could be parasites. Finally, sinus infection."
"If you're going to list all of the things it can't be, you're gonna need more colors.",Cameron was right. No condition explains all these symptoms. But orange and green covers Everything.
Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.,And you think one is simpler than two.
"Pretty sure it is, yeah.",Baby shows up. Chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being. I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper. You going to go with the two or the one?
I think your argument is specious.,"I think your tie is ugly. Why is one simpler than two? It's lower, lonelier! is it simpler? Each one of these conditions is about a thousand to one shot. That means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million to one shot. Chase says that cardiac infection is a 10 million to one shot, which makes my idea 10 times better than yours. Get a calculator, run the numbers."
We'll run the tests.,Tests take time. Treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection and! what was orange?
What are you doing?,LEvel 4.
"No, I mean """,I know what you meant. We're waiting.
My throat hurts.,So you said.
How long are we waiting?,Two minutes less then when you asked me two minutes ago.
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.,"Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. His throat seems to have some condition."
He has a sore throat.,"Of course! Yes, why didn't I! I mean, because he said that! it hurt, and I, I should have deduced that meant it was sore!"
I was in a board meeting.,"Patients come first, right?"
"Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there was any doubt about its efficacy, huh?","You once asked why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right! at least, I think you're right. I don't really know now, do I?"
Go home. Drink some hot tea.,Excellent counsel.
"So, a Woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional powerplay?","No. If you look the way you do, and you say what you said, you have to be aware of the effect that it'll have on men."
Men should grow up.,"Yeah. And dogs should stop licking themselves, it's not gonna happen."
"Yeah, what are you doing here?",Looking for you guys.
Why didn't you page us?,'Cause I knew you'd be here.
Who told him?,"No one. I assume you're trying to prove my crazy two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're going to be in the lab. You spin the urine?"
Not yet.,Talk to me when you have.
Talk to me when you have.,What did you find out?
The kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.,I wonder if that's signifigant.
It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure. How did you know?,"Well, if you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong, you might have checked in on the poor kid."
You visited a Patient?,"I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him."
I looked in on him. He's much better.,"Ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong."
That smugness of yours really is an attractive quality.,Thank you. It was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.
"I get that you're not a big beliEver in the 'catParkng flies with Honey' approach, but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by clEverly taunting them?","Flies, no. Doctors, sure. If I'd said to Foreman, ""Nice try, it was a great guess, but not this time,"" what do you think he'd be doing right now?"
I think he'd be going home not feeling like a piece of crap.,Exactly.
You want him to feel like a piece of crap?,"No, I don't want him going home."
How much longer?,"9:30, I figure she was on the 8th hole when I paged her! PRobably got another half hour."
"I ran a TSH, T3 and T4. Patient's negative for hypothyroidism. Not talking about you.",Well the fact that he's getting better would indiCate the unreliability of the tests.
"If I'm right and it's a viral infection, one of two things always happens: Patient dies or the Patient's immune system fights off the invader. What's with her?","Her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows, it could be anything!"
"He's getting better. That doesn't prove you're right, it just proves he's getting better. It, it's not two illnesses! It can't be two illnesses!",I am so glad you work here.
"If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed could block his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus. Could kill him.","Well, that certainly would be a concern. Fifty bucks? Don't look away, the space monkeys will be all over you."
You wanna bet on the Patient's health?,"You think that's bad luck? Do you think that God will smite him because of our insensitivity? Well, if God does, you make a quick fifty. Go check his white blood count. If he's fighting off a virus like you think it'll be way up."
Hey.,"White cell count isn't up, is it?"
What if you don't find one? I can't stay here forEver.,The Patient could have died.
The one with the pulled muscle.,"Well, those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions. I, you know, I, I'm entitled to a consult!"
You are not getting out of clinic duty.,"Oh, come on. You've got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go warm and fuzzy Every time they pull a toy car out of a nose, you don't need me here."
"No, I don't, but working with people actually makes you a better doctor.",When did I sign up for that course?
When did I give you the impression that I care?,"Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion. I've got your home number, right? In case anything comes up at 3 o'clock in the morning."
What's with you and her?,Don't.
"Do you have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you ""","No! There is not a thin line between love and hate. There is, in fact, a Great Wall of Parkna with armed sentries posted Every 20 feet between love and hate. 36 Vicodin."
Who's the Patient?,I am.
You can't!,Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician.
"Yeah. You will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?","Well, we all have our limitations."
"House! Wrong bottle. Do me a favor. Take one of these, wait five minutes for it to kick in, and find Cuddy, and kiss her ass.","What was the kid's first symptom? You did the history; of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?"
"Ah, the cough.",Gout.
"Gout? Uric acid crystals in the joints? The symptoms are pain, swelling, redness, stiffness! not one of which do I see on that board.","Because he doesn't have gout. Every day, cells die. We survive because the remaining cells divide and replace the losses. The colParkcine, a gout medicine, blocks mitosis and stops cell division, which will result in abdominal pain, rash, nausea, fEver, kidney failure, low blood pressure, and will also mess with the bone marrow."
But he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?,"Because you guys were right. He didn't have two conditions at the exact same time. First, he got a cough. Now, because he's an idiot, he went to a doctor. In order to feel justified charging $200, the doctor felt he should actually do something. Oops. He wrote a prescription. 7000 people die each year from pharmacy screw-ups. Not nearly as Many as die from doctor screw-ups, but still, not something they use in their promotional material. The pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine. And the only thing it wouldn't do: it would do absolutely nothing to reliEve his cough. Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is almost always somebody screwed up."
"But once he checked into this hospital he was completely in our control. Our food, our pills, our Everything. So Even if you're right, no gout medication. He'd either continue to deteriorate or he would have gotten better. But he got better, and then he got worse. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.","Okay. Two people screwed up. Not as simple as one, but!"
"He's resting; he """,I'm Dr. House. I'm your son's physician.
You're the one he hasn't met. How can you treat someone without meeting them?,"It's easy if you don't give a crap about them. That's a good thing. If emotions made you act rationally, then they wouldn't be called emotions, would they? That's why we have this nice division of labor: you hold his hand, I get him better. If I start tucking him in at night, well, that's not fair to you guys, and if you start prescribing medicine, that's not fair to me. So what I want to know is: who stepped on my side of the med? Who cared enough to get stupid enough to give him his cough medicine?"
"When we checked in Dr. Foreman said ""","Tuesday, he's getting better. Wednesday, he's getting sick again. Somebody gave him his cough medicine Wednesday. Come on, nobody's gonna be mad. I just want to know who tried to kill the kid."
His throat was sore.,Page Dr. Occam. He's gonna want to hear about this.
"Sorry! He was coughing, and I just wanted to help him """,I wish you would dare. Where are the pills?
It was just cough medicine!,"No, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?"
"Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.",It was so perfect. It was beautiful.
Beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.,And triteness kicks us in the nads.
So true.,This doesn't bother you?
"That you were wrong? I try to work through the pain """,I was not wrong. Everything I said was true. It fit. It was elegant.
So! reality was wrong.,"Reality is almost always wrong. The cough medicine did something. Aggravated the condition. It's all over the place, must be in his blood."
What if it is his blood?,Lymphoma?
Unless you've got something better.,"Well, we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his CT scan showed no adenophathy, CBC showed a normal diffen smear, bone marrow showed no """
Screw the tests. Do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.,"He has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him."
"Yeah, you're right. Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.",I'll schedule him for surgery.
"Yeah, but no surgery today.",How you doing?
Okay.,"Great. I'm doing good, too. I get to knock off an hour early today. Know why? 'Cause I kissed my boss' ass, you Ever do that? I think she just said yes because she wants to reinforce that behavior. Wants me to kiss a lot of other people's ass, like she wants me to kiss yours. What would you want, a doctor who holds your hand while you die, or a doctor who ignores you while you get better? I guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die."
I should go.,"You think it's going to come out on its own? Are we talking bigger than a breadbasket? 'Cause actually, it will come out on its own, which for small stuff is no pRoblem. Gets wrapped up in a nice soft package and plop! Big stuff, you're going to rip something, which speaking medically, is when the fun stops."
"How did you ""","You've been here half an hour and haven't sat down, that tells me its location. You haven't told me what it is, that tells me it's humiliating. You have a little birdie carved on your arm, that tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation, so I figure it's not hemorrhoids. I've been a doctor 20 years, you're not going to surprise me."
It's an MP3 player.,"Is it! is it because of the size, or the shape, or the pounding bass line?"
What are we going to do?,I'm gonna wait.
For what?,"Okay, it's 3:00, I'm off. Would you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a Patient in Exam Room 2 that needs her attention? And the RIAA wants her to check for illegal downloads."
Brandon's not ready for surgery.,"Okay, well, let's leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh wait, which way does time go?"
He crashed during prep. He's also experiencing pain in his fingers. I think some bug may have gotten in the clean room. I think we should double his dosage of GCSF to temporarily boost his blood cell count.,Pain in his fingers! right.
Pain in his fingers! right.,Hi again.
Where's he going?,"Hey! How y'all doing? Interesting fact: Every sEven years it's a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?"
"Dr. House, this is a clean room.","Yeah, I read the sign. But cells of different organs reproduce at different rates. So, a new kidney Every three years, a new stomach lining Every week!. This is why colParkcine poisoning causes all of these symptoms but not all at once."
But we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills!,"ColParkcine does its damage in a very specific order. First of all, there's a pain in the abdomen, the rash, the fEver! isn't that what you got first? Then, the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to!."
Brandon.,"Right. Then it screws up your bone marrow, and then "" neuropathy. Painful tingling in the fingers and toes. And what do you suppose happens after that? Hair loss. The bad new is: your special boy is doing drugs."
"No, he's not!",Ecstasy?
"Twice, with Dan and Mike.","D'you know what they cut that stuff with? Apparently colParkcine, unless you ingested the colParkcine through your contact lens solution, or skin cream, or some other drug you're lying about. I don't know how it happened, I don't care how it happened, it happened. Start!."
Brandon.,"Lovely name. Start Brandon on fab fragments, and give him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out. And get some air in here! Make a note: I should nEver doubt myself."
"I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong now and then.","What, you don't care about these people?"
Big weekend?,"It's not for me, I'm fully stocked."
Cuddy got you doing inventory?,Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.
The gout medicine OD?,Yeah.
The fact that I know that it's a gout medicine OD would seem to indiCate that the case is already solved.,"Well, you'd be wrong."
"What about the fact that the kid is now, I beliEve the technical term is, not sick?",You know how Many forms of colParkcine there are on the market?
Stop it.,"Neither do I, but it's a lot. Pills, powders, liquids, IV fluids!. Somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some."
"So, you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?",He said he used it twice.
People lie.,"Yeah, but if you're gonna lie, it's """
"You know what, I'm not interested.",Not curious?
"No, because I'm well-adjusted.",Right.
It's what we expected. The accident caused serious damage.,It's amnesia.
"Enjoying our lounge, House?","I just came in to get milk for my coffee, which you're out of."
Flat or sParkling?,Flat.
Pediatrician'll take all the credit.,"Exhibit A: Baby girl Hartig. Term baby, 42 hours old. Went into seizures 6 hours ago, brought into the intensive care, diagnosed with obstruction of the small bowel."
I'm still amazed you're in the same room with a Patient.,"People don't bug me until they get teeth. Exhibit B: Baby boy Hausen. Another term baby, 48 hours old. Brought into the NICU before the Hartig baby: fEver of unknown origin, 101 degrees, trending upwards."
"Wow, that is amazing. You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge and heard about two sick babies. It's eerie.",Don't touch that.
All right!,We have an infection spreading in the hospital.
These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.,"They fell sick within four hours of each other. They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission's possible. They have the same symptoms."
"The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction. No matter how close their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.",What does bowel obstruction on a chart indiCate?
"Well, normally, I'd say it indiCates a Patient's bowel is obstructed, but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart """,It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the Patient's bowel is obstructed.
"Okay, you're upset because they threw you out of their lounge.",Look at the x-ray. It's a normal gas pattern.
"You want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.",Air. Air in the colon.
We're getting TiVo.,"If it's air, no bowel obstruction."
"Even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.",No. Something's infected both these infants.
And you're the only one who put this together because!?,Because I'm the only one who looked at both kids. I want them isolated; I want the maternity ward shut down.
Because you're better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.,"Radiologists always over-read babies' x-rays, especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology. He read into it what he wanted."
Which is exactly what you're doing. You're finding a cluster because you think it's interesting to find a cluster. Two! plain old sick babies would bore you.,"See, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks, 'cause you give me all these really great insights for free."
"Shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself. The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake.",We have an epidemic!
"Two sick babies is very sad, but it doesn't prove an epidemic.",How Many do?
How Many do?,Get up! We're going hunting.
For what?,Wabbits.
Wabbits.,"Hi. Bye. He's screaming, he's fine."
"Tragic, huh?","Overflow rooms, third floor."
We were just going to call.,Did he get hot all of a sudden?
"You'll be there very, very soon. Happy now?",No. But I am interested.
No. But I am interested.,"Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms."
"Well, there's gotta be something in common.",Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.
A needle in a haystack.,It's worse than that. We don't Even know what's the needle we're looking for.
Then why'd you let her go do it?,"Because the hospital's her baby, and her baby's sick. If she doesn't solve this soon, her head's going to explode, and I don't want to get any on me. So let's figure out what's in the haystack. Differential diagnosis, people."
Spreading too quickly.,Next?
"And they're not responding to a cycle of avirarapovirin. If it's some other virus, we'll nEver find it in time, anyway.","Which leads us to bacterial infection. It's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we've got something resistant. The usual suspects."
H-Flu.,"Okay, those are the big ones. Cultures will take 48 hours, might as well be post-mortem. We'll start them on Vancomycin for the MRSA and Aztreonam for the rest. Let's get MRIs, check for abcesses or some occult infection. I'll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find something important. Or unimportant."
We have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a Petri dish. Put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.,Lift up your arms. You have a parasite.
Like a tapeworm or something?,Lie back and lift up your sweater. You can put your arms down.
Can you do anything about it?,"Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states."
Illegal?,"Don't worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites """
Playdates!,It has your eyes.
But! that's impossible.,"Well, I assume you weren't getting your period. Maybe that should have give you an inkling."
But I'm on this birth control implant!,"Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm."
!and my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working.,"Mm hmm. Interestingly enough, you also don't get any periods if it isn't working, which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests. I'm going to send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care. You're due in about five months, so start planning the shower."
"Um, Doctor? Please. Me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon, but! oh, God. Like four months ago we had this really big fight. He moved out. I did something stupid.",One-night stand?
Ex-boyfriend.,"I'll schedule you a paternity test, too."
I can't let my husband know.,Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?
Yeah!,Then just have the kid. He'll nEver know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You're off to a great start.
Then just have the kid. He'll nEver know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You're off to a great start.,"Well, you look cheery. What's going on?"
And the urine tests show no casts.,Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I vote to take them off the Vancomycin.,There's no point in guessing. Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.
What the hell are you doing?,Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection.
That's wrong.,"We have four sick kids, at least. Who knows how Many more haven't started showing symptoms yet?"
We have a duty to these two!,If these two have different reactions we know how to save the rest.
So you're condemning one of these kids to die based on random chance.,I guess I am.
"So, you're going to flip a coin? That's how you decide which baby lives?",Can I borrow a quarter?
"Do you want to get sued, lose your license, House? Well, generally I'd applaud that, but my job is to protect this hospital, so I strongly advice you to come up with a medical rationale why Baby A should get Medicine X and vice-versa.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick. We didn't all go to law school. Your advice is that I should use medical reasons to make medical decisions? Hmm, that's not going to be as easy!"
Any medical justification. Doesn't need to be a good one.,"Well, Hartig sounds Jewish, so does Aztreonam, so we'll take the Hartig kid off Vancomycin, how's that?"
You can't experiment on babies.,Doctors experiment all the time.
On adults. With their consent.,Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.
Their informed consent. They have to know the other kid is getting a different treatment.,"Sorry, can't do that. It'd be unethical for one Patient to know about another Patient's treatment."
They have a right to know.,"If they know, they won't consent; that defeats the whole purpose."
That's their right.,Two more babies have just become symptomatic. I defer to your legal wisdom: which takes precedence? Six dying babies or a missing consent form?
"Dr. House! Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.",Who told you where my office was?
"Jill, come on, he obviously doesn't want us bothering him.","Ooh, I was trying to hide it."
"Look, Doctor, this is about the mono you said you thought I had!",The mono?
"Yes. You know, shouldn't Charlie be tested? You know, the test. The blood test.","Right. Yeah, I'm sorry, I sometimes forget Patients, I thought you were this idiot who doesn't know how to use birth control."
I can't have mono. I don't Even feel sick or anything.,"That's very often the first sign. Call my office in the morning, I'll schedule him for bloodtests."
Charging. Clear. Charging.,Chase. Time of death: 6:57 PM. The Aztreonam doesn't work. Double-cover all the other babies with Vancomycin.
I'll do it.,"Cameron, you tell the parents. Tell them their Parkld pRobably saved five lives."
"But Chase should """,Chase is busy.
You're the attending.,Make sure she does her job.
Make sure she does her job.,"I asked you to make sure she does her job, not do it for her."
She froze up.,She felt sorry for the parents so she shut up. You felt sorry for her so you opened your mouth.
She has a pRoblem.,"Yeah, she needs to deal with it. If you hadn't bailed her out, she would have done it."
"Great, then she wouldn't have slept for two weeks. Maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty. Lab work, research?","Yeah, what is it?"
"The Hartig baby. She's getting sicker, too. The Vancomycin isn't working, either.",Vancomycin doesn't kill it. Aztreonam doesn't kill it. What the hell is this?
Then these kids are dead.,"This is our fault. Doctors over-prescribing antibiotics. Got a cold? Take some penicillin. Sniffles? No pRoblem. Have some azithromycin. Is that not working anymore? Well, got your Levaquin. Antibacterial soaps in Every bathroom. We'll be adding Vancomycin to the water supply soon. We bred these super bugs. They're our babies. Now they're all grown up and they've got body piercings and a lot of anger. On the other hand, maybe antibiotics had nothing to do with it. Did you notice how low his BP was at the end? Even with three pressers?"
Heart damage?,Go home. There's nothing more you can do tonight.
Go home. There's nothing more you can do tonight.,"Baby boy Chen-Lupino. Time of death 6:57 PM Thursday, December 2nd, 2004."
"Baby boy Chen-Lupino. Time of death 6:57 PM Thursday, December 2nd, 2004.","This is a cross-section of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium. Fibrosis, lymphocydic infiltrates."
There was no sign of lymphcytosis in the blood tests.,"Yes, well, we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial. Nobody is scolding you. Unfortunately, all of those clEver reasons were wrong. It is a virus infecting their hearts."
A thousand of them? The kids don't have enough blood.,"Chase, you're the intensivist. How Many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids?"
"You're talking vials, not stick tests? I wouldn't take more than five or six.","Okay, so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six. Now, the autopsy's shown us what the virus does. So, let's go. What do we know?"
Cross out the herpes viruses.,"Also adenovirus. What else, what else? Keep talking."
You didn't find any lung damage?,No.
None of the parAmyxoviridae.,"Cardiac scarring, people."
"Enteroviruses, too, I think.",Echo 11.
Influenza A.,Influ A. Yes. And? I'm putting RSV down as a yes. That makes eight.
Eight vials of blood is pushing it.,"Pushing it, but we love that! Get the antibody kits, start testing the sick kids."
"All right, I'll start looking into whether there are any antivirals for these eight.","Wait a second. The, the kids on the floor who didn't get sick. Are any of them still in the hospital?"
"No, the Lindpert boy had a bit of jaundice. He should be checking out today.","I want to test his blood, too."
Why?,'Cause we need all the information we can get. The healthy kid can be our control group.
"All done, all done.",What did we get?
"Well, the sick babies all tested positive for Echovirus 11.",Great.
"And CMV, and parvovirus B19.",Three viruses?
"What's weirder, the healthy kid we tested: he's positive for Echovirus 11 and CMV antibodies as well.","They're infants. They have their mother's blood, their mother's antibodies."
So we just learned nothing?,Uh-uh. We have half the picture. The healthy kids survived because their mothers' antibodies saved them.
"The mom had CMV in the past she'd have the antibodies for them, the kid would be immune from it. So we test the sick kids' moms for Echovirus, CMV, and parvovirus.","And whichEver they don't have the antibodies for, that's what's killing their kids."
"Sure. {They enter the room, now in scrubs, and hold Maxine.]","Hey, Foreman? Got a minute?"
"So, pulmonary resistance is stabilized for the two kids, but BP's still ""","No news, then. How's Cameron?"
Dr. Cameron?,"Sure. Let's start with her, and move on to all the other Camerons we know."
"Sorry, I'm just not used to you asking about someone's well-being.",I can understand how the question would surprise you. I don't quite get how it would confuse you.
Why do you want to know?,Why do you want to know why I want to know?
Just curious.,"Me, too."
You don't get curious.,I'm the most curious Man in the world.
Not about trivialities.,"Well, then, this must not be trivial. How is Cameron handling Everything?"
Just fine.,"Great, glad we talked."
"Great, glad we talked.","Your husband is definitely the source of your ""mono""."
"Oh, wow. Oh, thank God. Wow, I'm going to be a mom. Whoa, heh heh. Thank you so much; I gotta get you a gift or something.",Sometimes the best gift is the gift of nEver seeing you again.
"Okay, all right! But, Dr. House, you've been so awesome. I mean, I really, totally trust you. Do you think you """,No.
-- could do the prenatal?,No.
Or deliver the baby?,That would be no.
"No, it's great.",They all gone?
Hartigs are checking out right now.,You look tired.
Thanks.,It's no wonder. You've had a hard time the last couple of days.
And you haven't?,"Not like you. Anyone who's that awkward either has no experience around death or too much, and I'm pretty sure it's not the former. Chase told me about that idea you had: the parents holding the baby. Where'd you get that? Did you lose someone? Did you lose a baby?"
Unfinished business?,I'm in the haystack.
"Ah, because now you know you're looking for a needle.",Right.
"If I tell you to ""let it go,"" it won't make any difference, will it?","Enteroviruses are spread by huMans. Fecal, oral! could be respiratory secretions, though."
"So, Cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff. Just wait until they come back.",That won't do it.
Why not?,"The shedder, whoEver he is, is so virulent, Cuddy must have noticed him."
Hmmm.,And the babies didn't share any common personnel. That's what's weird.
"Hey, seriously, Man, you're not supposed to be here.",I'm performing a delivery.
You are.,"Patient whose prenatal care I've been handling. Just checking her out a couple of minutes ago. Of course, I'll need one of you two guys to supervise."
When's she due?,Late March.
That's five months from now.,Thank God these chairs are comfortable.
Thank God these chairs are comfortable.,We are condemned to useless labor.
Fourth circle of Hell. Charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate the whole of classic poetry.,Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. Pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.
You're over two weeks behind on your charting.,Oops. I missed.
"What are you, eight?",Could an eight-year-old do this?
You better stop or it'll stick that way. You have a Patient in Exam Room 1.,"Yeah, but see, see, I'm off at twelve and it's already five of."
She's been waiting for you since elEven.,Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?
Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?,Hi. I'm Dr. House. What seems to be the pRoblem?
"Shhhh, Pius!",You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler. You been washing a lot of dishes recently?
I help out in the kitchen.,Anything new in the kitchen?
I unpacked and washed them.,"Should have spent your time saving souls, it's easier on the hands. This is contact dermatitis; you're allergic to dish soap."
Nonsense! We've always used that soap. Why is there a pRoblem now?,"I've been a doctor for years. Why do I have to keep assuring people that I know what I'm doing? A person can become allergic to substances that they've had repeated and prolonged exposure to. The good news is: free samples. Diphenhydramine. It's an antihistamine. It'll stop the allergic reaction. Take one Every eight hours, it might make you feel a little sleepy. And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream."
"Thank you, Doctor.",You want some water?
I have some tea.,"Well, you just relax for a few minutes. That stuff works pretty fast."
Still out by twelve.,How do you solve a pRoblem like dermatitis?
She talking to you?,I don't know. She's certainly looking at me.
"Oh, it's good to get a secular diagnosis. The sisters tend to interpret their diagnosis as divine intervention.",And you don't? Then you're wearing an awfully funny hat.
"Doctor, something's wrong!","Lift up your Parkn. Sister, you're having an asthma attack. I need you to relax. Roll up her sleEve, please. I'm giving you epinephrine, it'll open your lungs and help you breathe."
What happened?,Did she take the pill?
Yes.,It's pRobably an allergic reaction.
She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?,You figure somebody's out to get her? How're you feeling?
Better.,I'll put you on some steroids instead.
Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?,"It's called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast. But not this fast. Get a nurse, please. Lie back."
Help! Somebody help us! [House opens Augustine's shirt and listens to her heartbeat.,Somebody get in here! Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She's got no pulse.
"You diagnosed the Patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine, she went into respiratory distress, and you injected her with epinephrine. Presumably 1 cc.","0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her."
People don't go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.,She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

"The drawer has syringes with both dosages, you could have easily reached for the wrong one.",But I didn't.

"And the discipline board? Are they gonna whack your hand, too?",You're going to report me?
What choice do I have?,"Uh, how 'bout not report me?"
"The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate's up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response.",It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count.,"Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart pRoblems. Covers all her symptoms."
The lady just came in with a rash.,What the hell are those?
Candy canes.,Candy canes? Are you mocking me?
"No! It's Christmas and, and I, I, I thought """,Relax. It's a joke.
"Yeah. Untreated only 33% of Patients survive past a year; treated, five years.",Then I'd definitely suggest treatment.
"If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.",Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.
"Everyone screws up: your rule. I think you fit inside the subset of ""Everyone"".","I didn't screw up. Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID."
The sister?,"Oh, didn't I mention? The Patient's a nun. Sister Augustine."
Aw. I hate nuns.,Who doesn't?
There is that.,If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.
She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.,"Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am huMan and capable of error."
So you might have screwed this up?,No.
"So, it's only a theoretical capacity for error.",Good point. Maybe there isn't one. Maybe that's my error.
"You know, most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.","Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you?"
"Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you?",Let me guess! inflammatory bowel.
"Wow, yeah. Is it that bad?","Yes. It's also written on your chart. Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain! took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work """
"No, then I ""","Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine! I'm impressed."
By my medical history?,By how well your last doctor charted.
"It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom Every hour, but when the kids sit on my lap, it's!. The store sent me home, they're gonna fire me. Can't you put me back on 5ASA? Maybe it'll work this time?","Not likely. I'm giving you a prescription. It's cheap, which is good because your insurance company won't pay for it."
Cojorius?,"Cigarettes. One twice a day, no more, no less. Studies have shown that cigarette smoking is one of the most effective ways to control inflammatory bowel, plus it's been established that you look 30% cooler."
Are you kidding me?,"About the looking cooler, yeah. The rest is true."
Isn't it addictive and dangerous?,Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it's completely legal. Merry Christmas.
Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.,So what's that tell us?
"Ooh, I know! Prednisone compromises the immune system. Isn't that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn't have?","Yeah, but! hey. I'm think that's a trick question."
Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?,In ten seconds I'm gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
You're gonna admit negligence?,"Unless you leave the room. If you stay you'll have to testify. Five, four, three, two!. So, there I was in the clinic, drunk. I open the drawer, close my eyes, take the first syringe I can find "" So, what are the options for compromised immune system?"
"Sure, she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her.","On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary pRoblems, cardiac pRoblems "" it all fits."
Except her ANA was normal.,So redraw the blood.
"But the treatment is corticosteroids, prednisone, and we can't go there because of the encephalitis.",Then we'll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn't suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chAmber.
There's no protocol for putting a Patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune pRoblems.,"Oh, you people. Always with the protocols. Prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone. I am both amused and annoyed that you think I should be less stubborn than you are."
"You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?","The one that starts: First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone. Yeah, took a read once, wasn't impressed."
"Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage ""","Every treatment has its dangers """
Which is why we treat when we're only convinced the Patient needs the treatment.,"I'm convinced. You're not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?"
This is a chapel. A House of prayer.,"House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody's Ever here."
"I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine beliEves in things that aren't real.",I thought that was a job requirement for you people.
She's been known to lie to get sympathy. She's a hypochondriac.,"So, you're warning me that I may be treating a non-existent ailment"
"Sore throats, joint pains! there's always something wrong, and there's nEver a reason for it. Mother Superior plays right into it. Lets Augustine off work duties, treating her as fragile, special.",That must make you angry.
It bothers me. It's not really in Augustine's best interests.,Want some?
I shouldn't.,"I guess you've got to be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh."
Mm hmm.,"So, we've got pride, anger, envy, gluttony!. That's four out of sEven deadly sins in two minutes. Do you people keep records of these things? Is there a Cathlympics?"
They say you have a gift.,They like to talk.
You hide behind your intelligence.,"Yeah, that's pretty stupid."
"And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter, and if they matter ""","And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable."
"I barely know you, and I don't know if I'm right. I just hope I am. Because the alternative is, you really are as miserable as you seem to be.","You know, from the way you're looking at me right now, I'd say you just hit number five: lust."
Mixed connective tissue disease? Her ANA is barely elevated!,"Well, thanks for checking up on her. Good to know you've got my back."
"0-2 stat is down to 83, pulmonary pRoblems, breathing pRoblems """,Irritation from the oxygen is typical.
She comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest.,"That well just nEver runs dry, does it? If there was no underlying pRoblem, then why is she still having the rapid heartrate?"
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone!,"Her reaction is a symptom, not an error."
"There's always an explanation, isn't there?","Yes, there is! And if this one doesn't work will find another."
But nEver one involving you screwing up.,"One that fits all the facts. Look, we obviously have a difference of opinion, and that's fine, but unfortunately I've used up all the time I've budgeted today for banging my head against a wall."
"Can't get enough of this place, huh?",Came for my stethoscope.
"So, I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?","Okay, yeah. I'd like to clear my reputation."
"Oh, right. I forgot that you care about what people think. Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? It could cause lung cancer, you know.","You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?"
They ran out of colors?,"It's because people blame lung cancer Patients. They smoked, they screwed up, they deserve to die. The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt."
"Huh. Well, guilt does a lot of damage.",You said that with great significance.
You're not here to find your stethoscope. You're not here to clear your reputation. You're here because you're having doubts. You might have screwed up.,"I'm here because, if I'm right, Cuddy is killing that Patient."
"Okay, but if you're wrong?",Then she's saving her.
My mother's been dead for 10 years.,But she's always with you in spirit. What do you know about the nun?
Which one?,"The cute one. I think she likes me. The sick one, obviously."
Her parents died when she was a Parkld and she's been with the Church Ever since.,What's she lying about?
Why do you say that?,"I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?"
I don't know nuns.,You hate nuns. You can't hate someone if you don't know them.
Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.,"I have a theory on what makes good boys ""good"". It's not because of some moral imperative. Good boys have the fear of God put into them. Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training, to make good boys afraid of divine retribution so they will do what their daddies tell them, like, for example, going into medical school when it's the last thing they want to do. What do you think?"
"I think if she did have a secret, her boss would know.","Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently?"
No.,Any way she could have got access to drugs?
"Well, we lock all of our medications in the infirmary, and we don't keep prescription drugs here. Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly?",I've found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is pRobably the last person you should ask.
Ah. And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?,She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I'd have her repeat a year of nun school.
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.,Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.
Just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.,"So, what is the sick one's drama?"
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us. Tea?,"Sure. Do all of you lie? It's a good strategy, simpler when you all tell the same lie, but she has not spent her entire life as a good Catholic. When she had a cardiac arrest I had to open her blouse to do CPR and I learned two things: nuns can have nice breasts, and she has a tattoo on her shoulder of a skunk. Now, maybe it's the Sacred Skunk of Joseph, but as far as I know, Catholic foster care and monasteries do not keep tattoo parlors in their refractories."
"We consider that our life begins when we put on our habits and take our vows. What happens before then ""","Is irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me."
"Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old, but she left when she was twelve. She lived on the streets, she got into drugs. When she was fifteen, she became pregnant, tried to self-abort. She lost the Parkld, she became ill. We took her in when she came back. If we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you.",It's not. This tea is delicious. Local herbs?
"Of course he might be right! It might be the Hand of God at work. Don't say it's something else unless you've got something concrete to offer. What's this, hemlock?","""I'm going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another. I'm gonna stop you from killing your Patient."" It's figwort tea. Great for that little pick-me-up we're all looking for in the morning. Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart. Unfortunately, if you then get injected with Even 0.1 cc of epinephrine: instant cardiac arrest. Still, what the hell, it tastes great."
"Sister Augustine ""","Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak."
Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation!,All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a sEvere long-term allergic reaction.
That's what Cameron said in the beginning.,"Yes, she did. Well done. But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost killed this Woman. Take a lesson from Foreman: stand up for what you beliEve. Okay, let's go figure out how to save a nun."
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't.","Because it's been untreated for so long, it's gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems. So, what's the source?"
The dish soap.,"No, symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode. It's gotta be something she's been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery."
"Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.","Could be, but it's not definitive."
Get her in a clean room.,Okay. And we'll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we'll know that's what killing her.
It's a clean room!,How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?
Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV?,Checked that.
Latex tubing?,Checked that. Checked Everything.
"Well, it could be mast-cell leukemia. It can cause anaphylaxis.",Checked the blood lEvels. And it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylasix.
Maybe it's just divine will.,It's not my will.
"You do realize if you're wrong, about the big picture that is, you're going to burn, right?","What do you want me to do? Accept it, pack it in?"
Yeah. I want you to accept that sometimes Patients die against all reason. Sometimes they get better against all reason.,"No, they don't. We just don't know the reason."
I just wanted to say that I know that you did Everything you could.,"I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well. That's your pRoblem, not mine."
I was just being nice.,"Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that."
Sister Augustine's been extubated.,Good.
She's requested to check out against medical advice. She wants to go back to the monastery.,"Well, talk her out of it."
I think I may have talked her into it.,Room's paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.
"This illness is a test of my faith. If it's His will to take me, it doesn't matter where I am. I can accept that.","Does anybody beliEve anything you say? You're not accepting. You're running away. Just like you always do. You ran away from the monastery, you get laid, you ran away from the real world when getting laid didn't work out so good. Now things aren't working out again, so off you go."
Why is it so difficult for you to beliEve in God?,What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn't based on logic and experience.
"I experience God on a daily basis, and the miracle of life all around. The miracle of birth, the miracle of love. He is always with me.",Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby? Hmmm? And watParkng her mother abandon her because she needs another score. The miracle of love. You're twice as likely to be killed by the person you love than by a stranger.
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?,"You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot. 'Cause you can tell me you put your faith in God to put you through the day, but when it comes time to cross the road, I know you look both ways."
I don't beliEve He is inside me and is going to save me. I beliEve He is inside me whether I live or die.,Then you might as well live. You've got a better shot betting on me than on Him.
How'd it go?,She has God inside her. It would have been easier to deal with a tumor.
Maybe she's allergic to God.,We looked Everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place: inside her.
On her medical history she didn't mention any surgery.,She had one.
Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?,She didn't have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.
What if she refuses?,Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.
Oh my God!,"The copper cross, a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s."
"So, she's allergic to copper.","Rare, but it happens."
Wouldn't she know she had an IUD?,"She had an abortion. IUD must have been left in, embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn't be detected."
The sixth circle of Hell.,Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose and all the tissues are soggy.
I think that's the sEventh.,"Nope, sEventh is """
"God, we must be fun at parties.",I think we both know the flaw in that theory.
How's the Sister?,"Kidneys functioning, heart rate is normal. You know how it is with nuns: you take out their IUDs and they bounce right back."
Great.,Told you I didn't screw up.
You screwed up.,I gave her 0.1 cc of epinephrine.
"Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you off the case, you would have killed her. You want to come over for Christmas dinner?",You're Jewish.
"Yeah, Hanukkah dinner. What do you care? It's food, it's people.",No thanks.
Maybe I'll come to your place.,Your wife doesn't mind being alone at Christmas?
"I'm a doctor, she's used to being alone. I don't want to talk about it.",Neither do I.
You did good with the nun. Congratulations.,Thank you.
This is a good hospital?,"Depends what you mean by ""good."" I like these chairs."
"It's not the alcohol, it's gotta be something else.","Of COURSE it's the alcohol. Hello! This guy's a professional doctor. Plays golf and Everything, I bet. He's not gonna tell you your mom's an alcoholic without proof. I'm sure he scoped for varices , checked her esophagus, ran all kinds of blood tests. Doctors like this, they don't make assumptions, they do the work!"
"I'd be happy to refer you the case, Dr. House. You seem so interested.",What case? It's over. You're sending her home. How old is she?
You're a doctor?,Own my own stethoscope. Did I ask you how old she was? I forget.
Own my own stethoscope. Did I ask you how old she was? I forget.,Thirty eight year old Woman with no previous symptoms or history presents with deep vein thrombosis -- how did she get it?
"Oral contraceptives, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and what's the point here? A DVT's a DVT. Put her on IV heparin to prEvent future clots. What's the big mystery?",Fine. You're all sleeping. You need a clue. She's 38 years old! She's 20 years too young to get a deep vein thrombosis!
"I treated a 12 year old girl once, soccer player, she got kicked in the leg!","There was no trauma, none of the risk factors."
You took a history?,"I! have some notes. They're not mine, but they're reliable, I think, for purposes of this discussion. As for the immobility, well, she's real active right now, of course "" paranoia keeps her limber."
Paranoia?,"Oh yeah "" she's sParkzophrenic. And her kid wrote this , so it might be a little biased. Having to take care of his nutso mom and all. You think there's a connection? Do we include sParkzophrenia in the differential for DVT?"
Well!,The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.
The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.,"On the other hand, we don't really know anything about sParkzophrenia, so maybe it is connected."
"Well, the sParkzophrenia explains one mystery "" why you're so fascinated by a Woman with a bump in her leg. Like Picasso deciding to whitewash a fence.","Thanks. I'm more of a Leroy NeiMan Man. And it is only about the DVT. She's 38 years old, she should be!"
Right. Solve this one and you're on your way to Stockholm.,We don't Even know how to treat it! Come on! Fumigation of the vagina?
A little louder -- I don't think Everyone heard you.,"Two thousand years ago, that's how Galen treated sParkzophrenics "" the Marcus Welby of ancient Greece."
Oh! Clearly you're not interested.,I'm interested. I'm interested in how voices in the head could be caused by malposition of the uterus.
There's a better place for it?,"And now what have we got? We've got lobotomies, rubber rooms, electric shock "" my "" Galen was so primitive."
Where are you going?,Going to see the Patient. That all-important huMan connection. Thought I'd give it a whirl.
"You won't talk to Patients because they lie, but give you a Patient with no concept of reality!","If it wasn't for Socrates, that raving untreated sParkzophrenic, we wouldn't have the Socratic method "" the best way of teaParkng Everything, apart from juggling chainsaws. Without Isaac Newton, we'd be floating on the ceiling."
"Dodging chainsaws, no doubt.","And that guitar player in that English band "" he was great. You think I'm interested because of the sParkzophrenia."
Yeah. I'm pretty sure.,Galen was pretty sure about the fumigation thing. Pink Floyd.
"Mom, this is Dr!","Gregory House "" nice to meet you. Be all right if we spoke alone for awhile?"
"Well, you're gonna need me to!","Got your case notes! doctor. There's a cafeteria downstairs. Get yourself whatEver you want as long as there's enough left over for a reuben sandwich, dry, no fries, hold the pickles. Should run you about $5.80 with tax. I'll page you when we're done."
No! pickles.,Nice kid. How much do you really drink?
They're not boring. He likes that.,And the meds!
Baseball! I like baseball.,Very nice.
"Very sad. My boy and me "" we went to see a game.","Not ""Mets"" "" meds "" medicine. You take what he tells you to take."
No one beliEves me.,I do.
"Yeah. Well, he hates them, and he's fascinated by them. Tell me you can't relate to that symptom.",You told Luke it nEver hurt before.
"Just rough "" they didn't hurt.",Didn't?
"Learn anything from the ""huMan connection""?","Yeah. The Mets suck. Also, for the last two months, she hasn't shaved her legs. Because of the tremors! she cuts herself."
"The tremors aren't new "" she must always cut herself.","Exactly. Something changed in the last two months. I'm thinking the amount of blood when she cut herself. So let's start with some bloodwork. Collect and send for clotting studies, PT, PTT, factor 5, protein C&S, the whole shebang."
"If it's a reuben, that's the way he likes it.","Everyone, this is Luke."
"Cameron, it's nice to!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, save it, we're busy. Luke, give us another half hour with your mom. We need to do some tests. Nice kid. Take her off the psych meds, that way we'll know what's what on the physical side, and who knows, we might get more out of her. Don't worry "" no pickles."
Happy birthday.,OK! whose?
"I was going through your mail, and it was on a form. Happy birthday.",Oh.
No no no no no no !!,"Well, good news, the lab says it's not strep, so we're done."
Wait a second!,"No, really, not strep. Boys in the lab, sure, they're hard drinkers, but they're pros, you know. Plus, your kid actually has none of the symptoms of strep, I just figured it was quicker running the test than arguing with you. My point is "" go!"
The other kids hate it!,This is why you're here.
Sugar is the leading cause of obesity in America.,You want a doctor to scare her about the dangers of sugar.
She needs to get her weight under control.,"Well, you know! I feel sorry for those other kids, Wendy, who don't have a mom like yours "" a mom who knows that sugar causes heart disease, appendicitis, and athlete's foot."
That's not fair.,"Oh, yes it is. No, I get it. You want her to slim down a little, so she can wear pretty clothes like yours. Love the bracelets. Hey! What about matParkng outfits? You could be twins! She can't be your daughter, it's impossible, you look way too young! Happy birthday. Get the kid a damned ice cream cake."
You drugged her.,"Actually, I didn't. I've taken her off all medications."
"Your guy, Foreman, gave her Haldol.",We needed blood for some tests. I assume that was the only way to get it.
He knocked her out.,"Look "" I have a cane, and I know how to use it."
I hired you. You work for me.,"OK, can I go now? Boss?"
"Help! Somebody, help!","So, when I said, ""no psych meds,"" I'm just curious "" which word didn't you understand?"
The Haldol had nothing to do with the bleed. You know that. I used it purely as a chemical restraint.,"Oh, great, well, that's good to hear. So she won't experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives AREN'T pure."
Those side effects are so rare!,"Passing out, increased confusion, depression, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis, 'cause you just used it to restrain her. I'm so reliEved!"
She spit in my face!,It must have been so frightening for you.
What was I supposed to do? Tie her down?,"Yeah! Anything but give her drugs "" that's basically my point!"
"If it'd happened at home, she would have died. That ER doc, he was gonna send her home.","It turns out your best judgment is not good enough. Here's an idea "" next time, use mine."
I think they're choosing a movie.,Why did the Patient bleed out?
The clotting studies so far are normal.,"Well, cover your ears if you don't want me to spoil the ending. Everything was normal, except for prolonged PT time, which means what?"
"Usually it means, whoEver drew the blood didn't do it right.","Oh, that's right "" 'cause! you drew the blood. But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study."
That's right.,"And I'm right with you. I trust this result. For two reasons, a) because you are a good doctor, and b) because five milligrams of IV Haldol makes for a spectacularly cooperative Patient. The prolonged PT time makes me think she's got a vitamin K deficiency."
Vitamin K would explain the bleed but not the clot.,"Without vitamin K, protein C doesn't work. Without protein C, she clots. Clotting and thinning, all at the same time."
"What about another drug interacting with heparin, an antibiotic like ampicillin? That would !","ClEver, but she's not on ampicillin."
"Two months ago, she complained of a sore throat. And he got her ampicillin.",Which she refused to take.
It's more likely than malnourishment. Why not scurvy or the plague?,"Gee, I wish my idea was as cool and with it as yours. What is yours, by the way? Do you have one?"
"Alcohol. Simple. It causes immobility, which explains the DVT. It also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged PT time. Let's ultrasound the liver.","Three theories. Check out her place for ampicillin and diet, then ultrasound her liver. Let's find out who's right before she bleeds to death."
That's the only thing she'll eat.,"Ah. PRoblem is, you can't actually live on this stuff."
"I checked it out, I looked on the box, all the nutritional values were solid.","Yeah, vitamin A and C, but no K. That's why your mom got sick."
"So, what's the plan?",Load her up with vitamin K.
That's it?,"If it all checks out, you can take her home in a couple of days. Oh God, you're upset about something. You're gonna open to me now, aren't you?"
It's all my fault.,"Here we go!. OK, I'm gonna say this once. You have done a very good job taking care of your mother. If this was all she'd eat, then what else could you do? Gosh, just being a kid is a full-time job!"
"Shut up! I'm 18, I should be able to take care of my mom! I almost killed her.","Good example, just the time it takes to express those ridiculous self-centered teenage ideas! I don't envy your schedule. No pickles."
My mom doesn't like them either.,Smart Woman.
"Before she got sick, I didn't like how bossy she was, always telling me what to do, the right way to do it. NEver thought I'd miss that. Ah!",You should get that looked at.
No way vitamin K's the whole story.,"It's not broken. See this right here? It's the epiphyseal plate, otherwise known as the growth plate."
What's wrong with it?,"Amazing thing, this bone. If you know how to read it, it can tell you how old someone really is, exactly how old."
Great.,"Not Even fifteen. Almost, though. Two weeks away, maybe a month."
Last week. I was fifteen last week.,"Happy birthday to both of us. If you're gonna lie though, go big, go 21. That way you won't need your crazy mom to help you buy vodka."
"Great. Thanks for the tip. Now, when I bring my mom home, is there anything I need to know about taking care of her?","I suppose your biggest worry isn't the booze. You're 15, basically no mom. Parkld Welfare let kids get away with that, well, they wouldn't need those nice foster homes, and that would make them sad."
They'd put her someplace too. My life is working.,"Not the word I'd use. Most 15 year old kids are doing what they're supposed to be doing, you know, they're huffing glue, catParkng crabs!"
"If you turn me in, I'll sue you. That's privileged information.","Oh, relax. It's not Even your x-ray."
She needs a transplant.,That's gonna happen.
"She's a 38 years old, she's a mother...","She's a sParkzophrenic mother, with no money, on the public dole, in fact, who knocks back vodka Every time a breeze blows her way."
Mickey Mantle had a whole bar named after him. He got a transplant.,"Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit. Plan B. Surgery to resect the tumor."
He has no discretion. Five point eight centimeters is past the surgical guidelines.,Would he do it at 4.6?
"Why don't we just say it's zero, then we don't need him at all. Tumors grow, they don't shrink.",This one does.
"Good morning, Dr. House!","Good morning, Dr. Cuddy! Love that outfit. Says, I'm professional, but I'm still a Woman. Actually, it sorta yells the second part."
"Yeah, and your big cane is real subtle too.",Gotta go. Those running noses aren't just gonna start walking on their own.
The clinic can wait.,How long? Maybe we could catch a movie.
You should know by now my doctors have no secrets from me.,I don't beliEve it. Who came running to Mommy?
"It doesn't matter who. The point is, I know exactly what you did.",You have no idea what I'm talking about.
"Somebody knows about a bad thing you did "" that's a big field. But somebody you think might have told me, that narrows it down quite a bit. Someone who views me as a maternal authority figure. A young person, perhaps! How am I doing? You think I'm gonna get there? Presumably hospital business. How Many Patients!","It's Cameron. She! found out about my birthday. I thought she told you, and"
"Actually, I was just gonna remind you, you owe me six clinic hours this week.",Oops.
Hiccups. I've tried Everything.,"Um hmm. Pulling the tongue, icepacks on the throat, hitting yourself! the groin pinch. Well, you've certainly covered all the normal medical bases. Uh, how are you hitting yourself, though? Is it open hand or fist?"
Open hand.,"Well, that's how they teach it at Harvard Med. How hard though?"
"Well, that's how they teach it at Harvard Med. How hard though?","I'm sorry, I missed that. Could! could you do that again? That's! that's very good. Hiccups."
I need to speak with you. NOW.,"Mmhhmmm, I need to go peepee. Dial it up a notch and repeat. I'll be back."
"Mmhhmmm, I need to go peepee. Dial it up a notch and repeat. I'll be back.","Ooh, girl in the boys' bathroom. Very dramatic. Must be very important what you have to say to me."
Yesterday your Patient's tumor was 5.8 centimeters. Today it's 4.6. How did that happen?,"At a guess, I'd say ""Dr. House must be really really good "" why am I wasting him on hiccups?"" I wash before and after."
You also requisitioned 20cc of ethanol -- what Patient was that for? Or are you planning a party?,Do me a favor!?
Do me a favor!?,"I was gonna say ""leave,"" but that works."
You shrunk the tumor!,Only way to get the guy to do the surgery!
Fraud! Fraud was the only way. There is a reason that we have these guidelines.,"I know "" to save lives. Specifically doctors' lives, and not just their lives but their lifestyles. Wouldn't wanna operate on anyone really sick "" they might die and spoil our stats."
Bergen has a right to know what he is operating on.,"True. I got all focused on her right to live, and forgot. You do what you think is right."
You really didn't know.,No. I didn't. And frankly I'm angry. Which I'm guessing is the correct response. 'Course I'll know better once you tell me what you're talking about.
Your birthday.,"Oh. Anger was a bad guess. Well, normally I'd put on a festive hat and celebrate the fact that the earth has circled the sun one more time. I really didn't think it was gonna make it this year, but darnit, if it wasn't the Little Planet That Could all over again."
It's a birthday. It's an excuse to be happy. You think that's lame?,Why are you here? To buy me a pony?
I'm just waiting for the surgery.,"Yeah well, go scrub in."
Cuddy didn't say anything about pushing Bergen to finish the surgery?,Not a word. Some kind of mind game. She's waiting for me to crack.
"Well, either that, or she's just being nice.","Yeah, well!"
"You said you wouldn't call "" you're a real bastard, you know?",Yeah. I get that a lot. I don't think Mom's crazy.
Yeah. I get that a lot. I don't think Mom's crazy.,"""For in the old days, though she had young men's praise and old men's blame, among the poor, both old and young gave her praise."""
"""For in the old days, though she had young men's praise and old men's blame, among the poor, both old and young gave her praise.""",You called Social Services. It was you.
"No, no. No.","It's OK, it's OK, I get it. He'll have an easier time dealing with the system. Sure, he won't be with his real mother, but his real mother's sick. Someone needs to take care of him."
I'm not gonna live here.,"What would his future have been? Taking you to chemo and back on the bus! and Even if the cancer's in complete remission, he'll still have a mother who hears voices."
"Talk no more, talk! no more.","""Look what I do to him, limpie."" You said that. I checked the phone records "" only one call from this room. Smart "" they charge you two bucks a call. It was to Social Services of the State of New Jersey. You're his mother, couldn't do it to him anymore. Good for you."
SParkzophrenics can make rational decisions.,"On the small stuff, yeah, when to sleep, what to drink, no lemonade but I'll take some hemlock if you've got it."
Your Man Socrates.,"But giving up your son, because it's better for him "" it's so sane, so rational. Self-sacrifice is not a symptom of sParkzophrenia! it excludes the diagnosis."
She's not sParkzophrenic?,She's 36 years old when she first presents!
"It's a little late, but within the parameters.","The internist sends her to a shrink, one shrink sends her to the next, she tells them all she's not crazy, the drugs don't work and why would they if she's not a head case? She got clearer when I took her off the psych meds. You think I'M crazy."
"Well, yeah, but that's not the pRoblem. Didn't we just leave your office?",I like to walk.
I like to walk.,"Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters? Hi. My name is Greg House, I'm a doctor! oh, is that the time? Yeah, I'm sorry, my watch must have stopped. Listen, you treated a Patient about eighteen months ago, a Woman named Lucille Palmeiro, I wondered if you recalled running any tests! !at all. Oh, how terribly foolish of me, doctor, is it that late? Yes, I'm calling from London, you see, must have got my times mixed up so!"
"Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters? Hi. My name is Greg House, I'm a doctor! oh, is that the time? Yeah, I'm sorry, my watch must have stopped.

Oh, how terribly foolish of me, doctor, is it that late? Yes, I'm calling from London, you see, must have got my times mixed up so!","I have a headache. It's my only symptom. I go to see three doctors. The neurologist tells me it's an aneurysm, the immunologist says I got hay fEver, the intensivist! can't be bothered, sends me to a shrink, who tells me that I'm punishing myself 'cause I wanna sleep with my mommy."
Maybe you're just not getting enough sleep.,"Pick your specialist, you pick your disease. If it's not sParkzophrenia, what else presents with psych symptoms?"
"Oh, uh, Wilson's disease?",Very rare. Nice. I like it.
"If any of us did this, you'd fire us.","Well, that's funny, I thought I encouraged you to question!"
"You're not questioning, you're hoping, you want it to be Wilson's, boom! Give her a couple of drugs, she's OK!","July 17, an appointment with a Dr. Carne."
She didn't keep it. She nEver kept another appointment with a shrink he made after that.,"Carne is not a shrink. I looked him up, he's an ophthalmologist. Now why would she want her eyes checked?"
"Wilson's presents with cataracts, I think.","Yes, it does. It also causes slight cirrhosis, which Dr. Chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol. So what are we still doing here???"
"Yes, it does. It also causes slight cirrhosis, which Dr. Chase so eagerly attributed to alcohol. So what are we still doing here???",Lucy! I don't think you're crazy.
"Neither do I, but I'm crazy!",Come on.
"You're gonna see a bright light, OK? Your body might be accumulating too much copper. If it is, this should help us see something called Kaiser-Fleischer rings, copper-colored circles around your corneas. I guess we should start treating her for Wilson's.",It's what I'd do.
"Dr. House! Luke, you're making Dr. House wait!","That's OK, we're just here for the music."
"Luke, come on. I'm being discharged.",I heard a rumor.
"Thank God I had cancer, huh? It's terrible having Everybody think you're nuts!",Really?
"I called to thank you, did you get my message?",Yes. You're welcome.
"I'm nEver thanking you. You turned me in. I told you we were doing OK, it was none of your business.",Look. I don't care how you were living. I just wanted you out of MY life. That's why I had Dr. Cuddy call Social Services.
You OK?,You were right. It wasn't the DVT. It was the sParkzophrenia.
I know.,She's not nearly as interesting any more.
She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep a day since her admission.,Clinical depression. Incredibly contagious. Every time I'm around one of them I get blue.
It's not clinical depression.,"Great, you got it all figured out. You don't need me."
"Three ER doctors, two neurologists and a radiologist have all figured out what its not, we need to figure out what it IS.",Well maybe if above mentioned doctors were interested in my opinion they would have asked for it.
None of them are willing to subject themselves to you.,No pain no gain.
"The blood work showed no signs of inflammation, and no one can figure out what's actually the cause of--",Huh.
What?,Husband described her as being unusually irritable recently.
And?,"I didn't know it was possible for a Woman to be ""unusually"" irritable."
"Nice try, but you're a misanthrope, not a misogynist.",What's the first thing you ask a doctor who's referring a Patient?
"Are you questioning my ability to take a history? ""What's the primary""--","Not ""what?"". ""Why?"""
Diseases don't have motives.,"No, but doctors do. Why this Patient, what interests you? Give me the chart."
Why?,I find your interest interesting.
What's interesting about that? Hypersomnia is usually accompanied by irritability in depressed Patients.,"True, but not relevant. She's not depressed."
Hello! She's sleeping 18 hours a day!,FEver. Clinical depression does not cause fEver.
She could be sick and depressed?,"She's sick! Dammit, why didn't I think of that?"
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.,"Not the spleen. Thank goodness we hired a neurologist! Brain symptoms! hmm, could this be a brain pRoblem?"
You mean she claims she's nEver been outside the U.S.,Very good.
"Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub smears show no sign of parasites.",Has to be a tumor then.
"A tumor sitting directly on top of the brain stem? That three ER doctors, two neurologists, and a radiologist missed?",Partridge in a pear tree missed it too. Redo the blood work and get a new MRI with 2 millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic. And check for evil stepmothers. This much sleep usually indiCates poisoned apples.
Partridge in a pear tree missed it too. Redo the blood work and get a new MRI with 2 millimeter cuts through the mesodiencephalic. And check for evil stepmothers. This much sleep usually indiCates poisoned apples.,Anything else beside the shortness of breath?
"Not really, its actually just kind of a tightness.",You smoke?
"No, nEver.",Exercise?
Eight hours a day. I teach preschool.,Sounds fun. Any history of heart disease in your family?
Not that I know of.,Take a deep breath. Been under a lot of stress lately?
None more than usual.,"You're pRobably just a little anemic, but I'm going to do an EKG just to make sure."
Do I need to take this off?,"No, you can just pull that down in front. Good. Lord. Are those real?"
Do they look real?,They look! pretty damn good.
They were a present for my husband's 40th . I figured he'd enjoy them more than a sweater.,"That's so sweet. I'm afraid the cause of your pRoblem could be staring us right in the face. Actually I guess I'm the one doing the staring. Of course I can't be sure, I'd like to consult a colleague. He's actually somewhat of an expert in these matters. Can I get a page on Dr. Wilson?"
Well. That's what breasts look like.,Is a lie a lie if Everybody knows it's a lie?
"Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest! House, come on, they're breasts. They're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.","Lie number one, she did not do that for her husband, she did that for herself. She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different."
"No, she thinks if she looks different, she'll be more attractive, which, I have to say!",Not to her husband. Cosmetic surgery is so that Everyone else will look at us differently. Same reason you're wearing that tie.
"Well exactly, that was going to be my next point.","Last three months, same five ties. Thursday should be that paisley thing."
It's a gift from my wife.,No its not. Julie hates green. You bought that yourself. You want to look pretty. At work. Wilson's got a girlfriend!
"It takes TWO department heads to treat shortness of breath? What, do the complications increase exponentially with cup size?",I want an EKG and blood tests including tox screen on Mrs.! Exam Room 1.
You're ordering tests to cover your lechery. Interesting.,Very tricky case. You love Everybody. That's your pathology.
A small glioma could hide from contrast. We could do a PET scan.,"Yes, that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation."
Suddenly tests and radiologists aren't capable of error?,"A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make."
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.,Does the husband care about her?
He hasn't left her bedside.,Now way! it also means she doesn't have Lyme Disease.
What? Love conquers all?,Lyme Disease initially presents with a rash. Mr. Clingy would have noticed.
Did you look at her breasts?,Pff. Men.
Could be paraneoplastic.,She have any family history of breast cancer?
Her mother died of it.,"The brain, but not the brain. ClEver, huh?"
A lot has changed since your mom died. Don't worr-- don't give up.,No tumor?
And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?,"You don't. Those twelve percent, no treatment. They were too busy looking for the tumor, right till they put the Patient in the ground."
What choice do we have?,Treat the symptoms. IV Immunoglobulin
So we're just going to ignore the tumor?,Eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find. One of you needs to check out where she works.
Why?,Cause the husband's not sick.
"If it's not paraneoplastic and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin, it's obviously not coming from their home.","Foreman, you do it."
Why are you riding me?,It's what I do! has it gotten worse lately?
Yeah. Seems to me.,Really. Well that rules out the race thing. Cause you were just as black last week.
We had to sedate her.,You gave sedatives to a Patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?
It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.,Where's Wilson?
Onset immediately after IVIG isn't.,There is a simple explanation. Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.
Infection?,That's what the worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.
Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.,"If a Patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up ""most"" of it?"
"The symptoms rule out the rest. Serology rules out viruses, CSS smears rule out parasites.",In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain. It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.
But it's not possible for a Patient who's nEver been to Africa to have African Sleeping Sickness.,I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
She could have got it from a transfusion.,Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.
Which she nEver had.,Okay!
"Maybe she ignored it, figured she had a cold.","We rejected Lyme Disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet hacking cough is just going to slip right by?"
"Hey, it's either that or she missed her exit on the turnpike and wound up in Africa.",Two lousy ideas. Unfortunately they're better than all the other ideas. Tularemia. Bizarre. Very nice. That's why I ride you.
"By ""safer"" you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her?",Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?
Yep.,"PRobably inconclusive, but worth doing. So what's her name? When do I get to meet her?"
There's nobody. Give it up.,"Your lips say no, your shoes say yes."
Well they're French. You can't trust a word they say.,"Solid, yet stylish. A professional Woman would be impressed. I'm thinking accountant, actuary, maybe. It's somebody in the hospital. Patient? No, chemo's not sexy. Daughter of the Patient? She would certainly have the neediness you need."
I'm not gonna date a Patient's daughter.,"Very ethical. Of course, most married men would say they don't date at all."
"There was no date! I had lunch with one of the nurses. It's her first time in an oncology unit and she's having a tough time, emotionally.",Perfect.
I wanted to be nice. That's all. I mean it.,You always do. It's part of your charm.
"Hi boys. Mrs. Campbell's test results. Oh, you remember her, the preschool teacher with the heart of silicon.","Nope, doesn't ring a bell."
"They came in yesterday, I figured you guys would have been all over them. I know how concerned you are.","She's all upset because we paid more attention to the other girl. You check out her ass, I've got the chest."
"The tests were normal. Course that's just my opinion, you may want to call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.",You check her EKG results before she left the other day?
You ordered it.,You're the responsible one.
What's wrong? They look normal to me.,Where is she?
"Waiting downstairs, why?",I was right.
Do I have to get rid of the implants?,"Surprisingly, no. But your EKG shows a slightly decreased heart rate."
Is that a pRoblem?,"You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying?"
Lying?,Does your husband have high blood pressure?
My husband?,"Yeah.. see, if you're gonna repeat Everything I say this conversation is gonna take twice as long."
"Yes, he was diagnosed six moths ago!",He do a lot of cooking at home?
"Not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.",Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?
"Wait, are you saying that--",That it looks like your husband stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with brown sugar.
You think my husbands trying to poison me?!,"No, nothing like that. He just doesn't want to have sex with you. Decreased sex drive is one of the most common side effects of the beta blockers he's been taking. I'm guessing he figured if you're both frigid, no harm no foul. You should have gotten him the sweater."
That's ridiculous.,"Fine. But if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, I'd start making your own breakfast."
Wait! What should I do?,"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing: buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! Huh."
"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing: buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! Huh.",Lab tests inconclusive?
Not surprisingly.,"No. Too bad. Luckily, I have the answer."
To what?,Thanks for asking. The life itself. Sex. Anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex.
Sleeping sickness from sex?,It's not without precedent.
I'm pretty sure it is. Unless you're talking about going to Africa and having sex with the tse tse fly.,A Portuguese Man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness. His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.
"Oi, where'd you find that",The Journal de Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. You don't read Portuguese?
You do?,I'm pretty sure that's what it said. Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.
Her husband has nEver been to Africa either.,"Ooh, stymied again. Your logic is bulletproof."
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms is more likely than cheating.,Because?
They're completely devoted to each other.,Because?
They love each other.,Or?
They're overcompensating for guilt.,Find out which it is.
You want me to ask a Man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?,"No, I want you to be polite and let her die. Actually, I don't want you to ask her anything. Foreman take the husband, Chase take the wife."
You don't trust me to do my job?,We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.
"And how exactly do you re-formulate ""Have you screwed around?""",Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?
Yes.,"After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago I figured that was your thing. But you've nEver been prescribed folic acid, and you can't lose a baby if you've nEver been pregnant."
You pulled my medical records?,"You coughed the other day, I was concerned."
You were curious. Like an eight-year old boy with a puzzle that's just a little too grown-up for him to figure out.,"To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to!"
Absolutely not. I love her,"Alright then. They say no cheating, we cross off sleeping sickness. Any new ideas? Ok, we go with Foreman's Tularemia. Start her on IV-Chloramphenicol 25 milligrams per kilogram four times a day. Good night."
I don't know. She's in a coma.,There's only one way a Tularemia Patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.
The Patient doesn't have Tularemia.,And then there was one. Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much. It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.
And then there was none. We still have the pRoblem of explaining how a white Parkck from Jersey who's nEver traveled south of D.C. has African sleeping sickness.,"Well, the obvious explanation?"
"I made it clear. If this guy's lying about sleeping around, he knows he's murdering his wife.",Does seem unlikely! Go away.
What are you doing?,Checking for lymphadenopathy. And waiting for you.
Who are you?,I'm Dr. House. Your wife has huMan African Trypanosomiasis. Sleeping sickness.
"You mean its not Tularemia. A virus, tumor or- or cancer.",Nope.
I've nEver had an affair.,I beliEve you.
And I trust Elise.,The treatment for this disease is a drug that's! fatal on its own ten percent of the time. Which is why I need your written consent before I can legally prescribe it.
Why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?,"I don't ask why Patients lie, I just assume they all do."
But why?,"To protect you, because she didn't think it mattered. It just seemed easier because! that's what people do. Now, If you're absolutely certain that your wife has nEver had sex with anyone but you since you've been married, then I'm wrong. But if you think there's a possibility that just one time she wasn't perfect! one weekend you're out of town! one fight when she ran to a friend, one stupid Christmas party! then you need to allow me to start treatment. Because if we don't! she's gonna be dead by tomorrow morning. Do you trust your wife that much?"
I don't know!,I'll start the treatment.
So we're treating her for African sleeping sickness because you don't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?,And you do?
Yes.,And you need to tell me that?
"Look I'm not having an affair. I had lunch, with someone I work with, at work. Once.",I beliEve you. What I don't beliEve is that it'll be just once.
I love my wife.,"You certainly love saying it. I'm sorry. I know you love your wife. You loved all your wives. PRobably still do. In fact, you pRobably still love all the women you Ever loved who weren't your wives."
"You can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that?",Yeah. And you're the good guy.
At least I try.,"As long as you're trying to be good, you can do whatEver you want."
"And as long as you're not trying, you can say whatEver you want.","So between us, we can do anything. We can rule the world!"
"So between us, we can do anything. We can rule the world!","Mixing up some margaritas? Mines a double, Senorita. That's Portuguese, you know."
Spanish.,Uh-oh. What's going on?
I'm re-calibrating the centrifuge.,"Turn around. It's a very sad thing, an un-calibrated centrifuge. It makes me cry too."
I'm not crying.,Ok.
I told the husband he was a jerk.,Why?
"When I was in college, I! I fell in love, and I got married. And!",At that age the chances of a marriage lasting--
"It lasted six months. Thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain. There was nothing they could do. I was 21, and! I watched my husband die.","I'm sorry... But that's not the whole story. It's a symptom, not your illness. Thyroid cancer would have been diagnosed at least a year before his death, you knew he was dying when you married him. Must have been when you first met him. And you married him anyway. You can't be that good a person and well adjusted."
Why?,Because you wind up crying over centrifuges.
FEver spiked at 104. Echo shows global hyperkinesis.,Blood pressure?
Barely 90 over 40.,You give her dopamine?
What's happening?,"We would have expected your wife's condition to show some improvement by now, but it hasn't. It's going the other way."
She LOVES you.,I need to know who you had the affair with. He has to be notified so he can get treatment as well. Why did you lie to us? You knew your life was at stake.
"He's not coming back, is he?","We all make mistakes, and we all pay a price. I need that name."
The kid was just taking his AP calculus exam when all of a sudden he got nauseous and disoriented.,That's the way calculus presents.
SEvere bradycardia. Heart rates down to 48 and falling fast,You know the kid?
No.,Mom real good looking?
I didn't notice.,"Then it's a mystery. Not why he's sick, but why you care so much. The gift shop's open, buy him a card."
He's not responding to atropine.,Boys love fart jokes. Find him one with a good fart joke. He's a teenager. It's drugs. Tell those ER geniuses to give him charcoal and naloxone so you'll stop following me.
His tox screen was negative. He's still whacked out,"You don't care about the kid. You just find his illness ""intriguing""."
"His CAT scan was clean. There's no sign of infection, and it's not diabetes.",And you don't care about him.
That's what you wanna hear. Not in the slightest,Me neither. Means we'll be objective
Maybe its shigellosis.,Wouldn't account for the bradycardia.
Viral myocarditis?,"Wouldn't account for the whacked out. So, what's the differential for the negative tox screen?"
Unless someone screwed up the test.,That nEver happens.
That's new.,"Copy maParkne toner. Same punch as GHB. A little pricier, way more dangerous. On the other hand, it is legal. I want you to go to his House and find his stash. Betcha know all the good hiding spots."
"Actually, I nEver did drugs.","Better go with him, in case he gets high. How much atropine is the kid getting?"
1 milligram,Make it 2. In case he needs his heart later on.
This one's open.,"I am extremely disappointed. I send you out for exciting new designer drugs and you come back with tomato sauce. Betcha paid twice as much, I got mine online."
"Source of botulism, as well as a million other toxins that cause gastroenteritis, cardiac symptoms, and mental confusion.",I'm not sure about gastroenteritis but mental confusion? Bring it on!
Do you have a death wish?,.I notice he didn't try to save me
I figured you were trying to make some kind of subtle point.,I was. Kid just started seizing. Not a symptom of food-born toxins.
Also not a symptom of drug use either. Not two hours after admission,So what would make him seize! in addition to all his other delightful symptoms.
Carbonates?,Or organophosphates. Organochlorines.
We should wash him down. The poison could still be on his skin.,Already told the nurses.
I feel! good.,That's your complaint? You major symptom?
"I notice colors more. And music. I- I'm really hearing music. I'm eighty-two, and I'm supposed to be playing canasta with the other old ladies, but! now when I see a guy with a cute butt! I just cant stop looking at him. Or a sexy beard.",And you figure that enjoying cute butts is a sign of disease?
"So I watched it. And it had this actor in it. This kid called Ashton Kutcher. Now, I think about Ashton all the time. All the time.",Aha.
You remind me of him. Same bedroom eyes.,People are always mixing us up.
I suppose you'll need to check my heart?,No! No! that won't be necessary.
I told you!,But I am going to admit you to the hospital for tests.
What tests? She's just old!,"And you're just insufferable. Your mother has had a sudden personality change, she should be checked out. I'll have a nurse come to admit her. I'm too handsome to do paperwork."
Are there any stronger treatments for the organophosphates?,"Oh, damnit you caught me. Went with the weak stuff, just trying to save a little money."
What's the success rate?,"Excellent, I'm sure. It's the US army, ""be all you can be"". The point is, what are the kid's chances without it?"
Minimal at best. The poison's broken the blood-brain barrier.,"I assume ""minimal at best"" is your stiff upper lip British way of saying ""no chance in hell""?"
I'm Australian.,You put the Queen on your money. You're British. - Call your professor.
Great minds think alike.,By the time they get here we better know which one we need.
If we figure out how he got exposed we'll figure out what he got exposed to.,"Well, the mom had homemade tomato sauce. Call me crazy, but I'm thinking maybe! homemade tomatoes?"
Front yard vegetable garden.,"Kid's out there spraying, pretty girl walks by! hormones raging! spray can goes off in his face..."
I'll keep the kid alive! For a while at least.,I'll have lunch.

"""-with joy. Oh House, your very name! will nEver leave this girl the same."" Not bad for an eighty-two year old. She asked me to give that to her true love.","What can I say, Parkcks with no teeth turn me on."
That's! fairly disgusting.,And that's ageism.
You better watch yourself around this babe. Here are the test results.,Impressive.
I found the pesticide. It's disulfoton. And it's empty. He used the whole can.,"Okay, I'll get Chase on it."
I can't let you do this.,Get a court order. Unless you want to see someone killed by sheer irrationality.
Maternal instinct is always irrational. That doesn't mean it's wrong.,Actually! that's the definition.
It doesn't mean she's mentally incompetent,She's risking her son's life based on a teenager's claim that he washed something. How mentally incompetent can you get?
That's a brilliant legal argument.,"Listen, have your Harvard law dog whip up some high-grade, legal-sounding psycho babble. ""Temporary insanity brought on by acute panic distress syndrome,"" I don't care. We have to give him the hydrolase."
Her only sign of mental illness is that she disagrees with you. Some would consider that a sign of sanity.,"Not the kid, let's ask him. Oh, I forgot we can't. He's dying."
Get the mother to sign off that she's refusing this treatment.,"Goodbye. ""I, Margo Davis have been informed of the risks which may arise from my refusal of advised medical care. I here by release-"""
Who are you?,"I work for hospital. """"the Princeton Plainsboro TeaParkng Hospital, its employees agents, and otherwise from any adverse medical conditions resulting from my refusal. It is not the hospital's fault if my son kicks off."""
"""Kicks off""?","I punched up the language; mostly for clarification. ""I understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic-"""
Why are you doing this?,"""-but I am convinced that I know more than they do. I took a biology course in high school, so! yeah. Besides, I enjoy controlling Every single aspect of my son's life, Even if it means his death."" Sign here please. I brought a pen."
Who are you?,I'm the doctor who's trying to save your son. You're the mom who's letting him die. Clarification. It's a beautiful thing.
I'm the doctor who's trying to save your son. You're the mom who's letting him die. Clarification. It's a beautiful thing.,She rethought her position. Start him on the hydrolase.
His names Park Ling. He was admitted twelve minutes ago. Identical symptoms as Matt. Chase isn't sure he's gonna make it.,"Matt's next-door neighbor, by any chance?"
"The second kid's heart is almost as weak as Matt's; were gonna have to get him wired up, too. And I don't know how long Matt's brain's gonna hold up; his hearts not pumping enough oxygen.",How much are you giving him?
Eighty percent.,Make it ninety.
We're risking damage to his retina.,"What the heck? Do it anyway. He's a calculus student, he pRobably likes having a brain! I'll have Foreman do it."
I'm the primary.,"Yeah, but the mom wants to get rid of you. And you know me, I'm a people-pleasing kind of guy."
She complained? About me?,She went to the principal. Told Cuddy you did drugs in high school. This is gonna go on your perManent record.
I was trying to get information; it was a strategy.,"She also used the word ""slacker"". Want to come in, smoke a little weed, watch some MTV?"
High school has no idea what could have happened.,You sure Park didn't sneak out of Matt's tomato patch? Maybe they sniffed disulfoton together to get high.
"Same school, different grades, different cliques, different Everything.",They Managed to get poisoned together; they must have something in common.
Their classes aren't in the same building. They don't Even eat lunch in the same lunchroom.,How do they get to school?
"Well, it took you long enough. We've been waiting!",Could you step outside a minute?
Why?,Because you irritate me.
"He is my son, doctor. He's just a little cranky from not eating.","Fine. Mrs. Adams, have you had any recent sexual activity?"
"Not in bed, dear. Why do you ask?",Because you have tested positive for syphilis.
That's impossible. And insulting!,I don't think it's the first time Mom's heard this diagnosis.
"Cupid's disease, that what we used to call it.",When did you get it?
He was. We're talking about sex. I was treated.,"Which suppressed it. In your case, for 60 years. But now it's back, and the spirochetes that cause syphilis are eating away at your brain cells."
Oh! That's revolting.,"It's not as revolting as ChlAmydia; that's got seepage. And it's the 21st century. We've got flying cars, talking dogs, and penicillin. High-dose regimen for two weeks, you're cured."
I don't beliEve it.,"Yeah, well, pinch yourself."
I guess for the next two weeks I'd better practice safe sex.,You'll be fine. Just feed that cranky kid.
The county's worried about West Nile so they sprayed ethyl parathion right next to the bus route.,Do you have the hydrolase for ethyl parathion?
"Yep. Only one pRoblem. Matt's mom faxed his record to the CDC, and she refuses to let us do anything till she hears back from them.",You're getting good at this God-like doctor thing. Why don't you talk her out of it?
Or mine.,Only one Man left in the bullpen and he throws like a girl.
I hate sports metaphors.,Give her the high hard one.
"Their hearts are barely pumping. Their lungs are shot, now they're showing liver toxicity.",I guess Matt's mom won't nominate us for any Doctor of the Year awards.
The only thing they have in common is the bus.,"Except their symptoms. Given their sEverity, in fact their cardiac symptoms are getting worse much faster than all their other ones, what does that tell us?"
Poison was pRobably absorbed through the skin.,They were admitted at 8:45 and 11:00. When were they poisoned?
"In a case that bad, more like 1 1/2 to 4.","So, Matt was poisoned before 7:15. Before he got on the bus."
You think each kid got poisoned in his own House? Two separate exposures?,What do teenage boys do in the morning? Besides the obvious?
"Wake up! go to the bathroom, and! the obvious. Then check their zits in the mirror.",Do they use the same acne cream?
"Because acne cream contains lanolin, which could have pesticides, and you're thinking they both bought the same product which-",Could be contaminated. Shaving cream?
Park doesn't look like he shaves.,He sweats.
Deodorant could contain lanolin.,These people have pets?
"Fleas, flea powder.","Ok. Go to their Houses, check for anything that could have touched their skin between the time they got up and the time they got on the bus. And I'm running low on tomato sauce."
Dr. House!,I sent you home.
I came back. I took a cab so my son wouldn't try to chaperone us this time.,"I'm sorry, but the fact that the sexual pleasure center of your cerebral cortex has been over-stimulated by spirochetes is a poor basis for a relationship. Learned that one the hard way."
"Look, Dr. House, these feelings that's I've been having. Is it all because of the syphilis?",Yes.
"Then here's the prescription you gave me. Well, it's not like I'm going to infect anyone.","No, but it'll kill you."
"Well, you gotta go sometime. And I really don't want to play canasta for the rest of my life. I! I like feeling sexy again. And making a fool out of myself with handsome young doctors.",Do you think I would have given you this if it would stop you from flirting with me?
But if I'm cured?,The spirochetes will die off. But the little pieces of your cerebral cortex that have been destroyed won't grow back. You're brain damaged. Doomed to feeling good for the rest of your life.
Oh! Oh! thank you!,Georgia!
"When I stop being contagious, I'll come back for a checkup.",Yeah!
Matt's ALTs are up to 800. If they get any higher we can toss his liver.,Yeah?
Or any other kind of deodorant.,What about shampoo?
"No to shampoo bar soap, dish soap, dish detergent!",What about laundry detergent? Maybe they both washed their clothes this morning?
"If we cure Matt, he can use his close brush with death on his college essays. Admission guys love that stuff.","That's how you got in, right? Jail House diaries?"
-environmentally safe formula. It's the same!,Bring in the detergent.
So the detergent was contaminated with pesticides?,"Soaked into their clothes and got absorbed into their skin! Hi, look, the clothes your son wore today. He washed them this morning, right?"
What?,Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.
My wife said he didn't.,"Then I'm guessing he washed them last night, without you knowing."
Now what?,What about Matt's clothes? They new?
"They're ruddy old jeans, I think. They've been bagged up and taken downstairs.","""Davis."""
Yep they're Matt's. And they're old,"And yet the label isn't faded in the slightest. Fake old. 100 dollars for the homeless look. What, kids aren't pretentious in England?"
"Park's are a different brand, how could they both be contaminated?",That is a question for the ages. In the meantime get these tests in.
I nEver bother to wash new clothes before I wear them.,"Right, your wife does. She wants you to feel nice and comfortable."
"Hey! I'm a Man. I don't have time for laundry, I'm saving lives here. No, she doesn't wash them either.","So your skin absorbs a little dye, the odd chemical here and there!"
"Well, you know me. Always living on the edge.","Judging by the self importance of your strut, you have identified the chemical in question."
Phosmet.,Hit him with the hydrolase.
Park's parents said yes but-,Mighty mom said no. She's gonna feel like million bucks when Park lives and her son dies. Send Cameron. She's the only one who's Managed to talk her into anything.
What is this?!,"Thought I'd hang out in case you change your mind! and I can give Matt the medicine right away. Don't worry, I've got time."
The CDC promised they'd call.,"They will. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after. Takes time to review faxed records. Then they'll pRobably tell you they can't make a decision based on faxed records. This is Suzy. She's nEver gonna marry him! no money."
What makes you think you're right this time?,"Same reason as last time. You wanna see how the other kid does first, that's ok. Might help you. But there's a real good chance that-"
"What? Matt might ""kick off""?","A little blunt! I was gonna say ""run out of time,"" or just sort of let my voice trail off!"
"Hello? ! Yes this is Margo Davis. ! But you have his records; I sent them. ! Yes, I understand. They can't help me.",They haven't seen him. Can't make a decision based on-
"The CDC is unable to give an opinion at this time, and! we're gonna have a doctor in your area next week.",You fooled her with that?
"Some guy was selling pants off the back of his truck near the school. When he wasn't busy as a clothing entrepreneur, he did daily at the cornfield over by route one. Used the same truck for both jobs.","Spilled pesticides on the pants, didn't bother to clean up. So, why are you still here? Why aren't you out there making up with the joyful mother?"
Why would I do that?,"No reason at all, you don't care about her or her son."
"Oh, Dr. House. The CDC called. Again.",Oops.
Call an ambulance! Now!,I want in.
"John Henry Giles, you a fan of his music?","He's a musician? That paralysis thing, guy can't walk for two years and nobody knows why, that seems mildly interesting."
Forget his paralysis.,Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.
"As far as this hospital is concerned, this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia. Boring.","But that ""not walking"" thing, that could turn into something serious!"
Marty Hamilton is his primary physician out in California. He's dealing with the paralysis.,"Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries. Making real progress. Fixed Everything but the legs."
"Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team. And by team, I don't mean you.","Like I always say, there's no ""I"" in ""team"". There is a ""me"", though, if you jumble it up."
Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.,I know. I did accidentally glance at his resume before I hired him.
He wants someone he can trust.,He must have spoken to Foreman's parole Officer.
Someone who will stick to the pneumonia. John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.,I respect that. I'm not going to get in his way.
It's Foreman's case.,"It's pneumonia, he can handle it. Guy's already paralyzed, how badly can he screw it up?"
"Dr. House, is there anything back from Micro?",Not yet. You gonna fire me?
You can make up for it by washing my car.,"Oh, this is fun."
"Let's keep him on the broad-spectrum antibiotics, and since he's displaying septic physiology, draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function.",How about the paralysis?
We're sticking to the pneumonia.,"Well, you certainly are, boss. Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice."
The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton. It's ALS.,"Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it. No tests, no treatment. It's a disease of exclusion """
-- because Hamilton has excluded Everything else.,I haven't. What else could it be?
"Guillain-Barre, which would be rEversible.",Excellent.
Antibodies could be attacking the nerve. Multifocal motor neuropathy.,"Uncommon, but it fits. It's also treatable. Did Hamilton try putting the guy on IVIG?"
"No, because the MRI showed ""","Well, let's do an MRI of our own."
Guys? It's my case. ALS fits. It Even predicts the pneumonia. The paralysis is progressive.,It's a death sentence.
He signed a DNR.,He rhymes with dinner?
He signed a DNR.,Oh. That makes more sense. You tell him it might not be ALS?
No.,"Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn't?"
I started him on IV steroids and ancinthroid.,"Great. If it was my case, I'd be adding a little IVIG to the mix."
For his pneumonia?,That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
He doesn't want anything done. No treatment.,"DNR means ""do not resuscitate"", not ""do not treat"". You do nothing, it doesn't matter which one of us is right. And hang on to that DNR. That signature could be worth a lot of money real soon."
"My nature isn't what it used to be. The little Man has lost some bounce in his step. He needs to crank it up, have himself some fun this weekend. He wants the blue pills.",You're talking about your penis in the third person.
"Me and him, two people.","Separate vacations? That'd be a drag for one of you. I don't think you need the pills. I think you have a conflict of medications. You need to up your insulin to ""chocolate Parkp ice cream"" lEvels."
Insulin?,"Yeah, you remember. That's the stuff you take for the diabetes that you forgot to tell the nurse about. Your hands. No hair, which means nerve damage. And your shoes look about two sizes too small which means you've lost sensation in your feet. And then there's your pants."
My pants tell you I have diabetes?,"No, they tell me you're an idiot. Powdered sugar on the right pant leg. Based on the two napkins in your right pocket, I'm willing to bet it's not your first donut of the day."
You're giving me the pills?,"Sure, why not? If you've got heart disease from ignoring the diabetes they'll kill you. Otherwise, you two have a fun weekend."
"Oh, yeah.",His stats are in the 70s. How long has he been like this?
10 minutes.,"Well, why aren't you doing """
The IVIG put him into respiratory failure.,You put him on the IVIG?
We did this.,So undo it! Chase!
It's too late! We killed him.,"Nobody killed him! He's not dead! Chase, intubate him!"
What are you doing? You can't do this!,Bag.
You can't do this!,Bag! He had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him.
He's stable on the ventilator. Oxygenating well.,"The IVIG made him worse, which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis. Okay, what's really wrong with him?"
What's wrong with you?,Everyone knows what's wrong with me. What's wrong with him is much more interesting.
You tubed him and he didn't wanna be tubed! He has a legal paper saying just that.,"To intubate or not to intubate, that is the big ethical question. Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it, maybe just practice some medicine."
"There's no question. It's the Patient's decision ""","-- if the Patient is competent to make it, if his thyroid numbers aren't making him sad."
It's nothing. Do not defend him.,Why did he sign that DNR?
"I didn't talk him into ""","No, he signed the DNR 'cause he didn't want a slow and painful death from ALS. What was happening to him had nothing to do with his ALS."
"Right! Exactly! It's the IVIG, you screwed up! You're not gonna let him die because you screwed up!","Technically, your case. You screwed up. Is that what this is about? Looking bad in front of your old boss?"
You assaulted that Man.,Fine. I'll nEver do it again.
"Yes, you will.",All the more reason this Debate is pointless.
All the more reason this Debate is pointless.,"His lungs are worse. Any theories? Oh, I'm sure he just went to the little boys' room. Come on, people."
"Uh, vasculitis?",Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.
Dr. House?,"Cuddy sent me a stripper again? Ah, love that Woman. So thoughtful."
There are case reports of Wegener's hitting both the legs and the spine.,"Well, it's not great, but it's better than ALS. At least it's treatable."
"It's a restraining order. You're not to come within 50 feet of John Henry Giles, and they've asked the DA to file criminal charges for battery.","Cameron, test the blood for c-ANCA."
These are criminal charges. They aren't going to let you take blood to make more tests.,"He has blood left in the lab, just add on the c-ANCA. Foreman's still got you doing bronParkoscopic suctioning for the pneumonia?"
Every four hours.,"Well, while you're down in his lungs, grab a biopsy. We'll need it to confirm Wegener's. And move the Patient to the second floor ICU."
Why?,It's right above the clinic. I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet in any direction. It's nice having a court order saying you don't have to work clinic duty.
It's right above the clinic. I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet in any direction. It's nice having a court order saying you don't have to work clinic duty.,Dr. Cuddy!
Excuse me.,You paged me.
Why the yelling?,"His bed is behind that wall. The plaintiff's. I can't, you know, come any closer."
It's right over the clinic. Very cute.,"Can we get the lecture over with, because I've got a, actually, I've got nothing to do. Take your time."
You need a Lawyer?,You don't have a pRoblem with what I did?
"When I hired you, I knew you were insane. I will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things, but once they're done!. Trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is, in itself, insane, so when I hired you I also set aside $50,000 a year for legal expenses. So far you've come in under budget.",Great. Any chance you could help me run some tests?
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton. He's flying in from L.A.,You can talk to him.
Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend of John Henry's to pull the plug.,Yeah. I need a Lawyer.
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube down Mr. Giles' throat against his will.,"A medical tube, saving his life."
"Dr. House, please let your attorney speak for you.","I'm sorry, your Honor. I was way out of line."
Why are you doing this? It's not going to keep you out of jail.,No.
"Even if you win, the restraining order and battery charge stay in place. What have you gained?",Time.
To diagnose him? You can't get near him!,I don't want to get near him.
"You know how some doctors have the Messiah complex, they need to save the world? You've got the Rubik's complex, you need to solve the puzzle.","Are you done, or do you have more references to 1980s fads? I'm trying to listen to this."
"The DNR order was witnessed by Dr. House's own staff, a, a Dr. Foreman.","My staff are idiots. I'm sure you know what it's like, your Honor."
And this poor guy has gotta stay on life support until we can schedule a trial.,"Your Honor """
"Dr. House, I will hold you in contempt if you don't sit down.",I have a medical issue.
"If it pertains to this case your attorney should """,It doesn't. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?
Your Honor!,"Your fingers. They show signs of clubbing, which indiCate a health pRoblem. Remember Bart Giamotti? Same thing, just dropped dead one day. Please see your doctor."
He's admitted this isn't relevant. Can we please get back to the motion?,"Of course, I'm sorry."
"Congratulations, impressive legal argument.",I watched Matlock last night.
"Oh, say no more. I didn't notice any clubbing on the Judge's fingers.",Neither did I.
"So, the family history thing!",Every family has some history of heart disease.
Biopsy only shows inflammation.,Start him on Cytoxan.
You're diagnosing Wegener's based on a little inflammation?,"Well, unfortunately I think we've exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesn't want doing tests on him."
But you don't --,We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.
"You can't do any more tests, but you want me to treat him?","The medicine's in the pharmacy, Patient's immobilized in the ICU. Sounds like a simple geography pRoblem."
Can I help you?,"Uh, I'm Dr. House, I'm """
"I'd appreciate any list of medications, anything like that.",I've started him on Cytoxan.
"For Wegener's, right? Look, Gregg. I checked you out, you know? I know you're a good doctor. You have to appreciate that I'm a good doctor, too.",Why?
"Wegener's is one of the first things I looked for. The biopsy and the blood tests were negative, just like yours.","There's an error rate, Marty."
"It's not your fault, Eric.","No, it's mine. Eric."
How's the old place doing?,"Oh, this is wonderful. But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out you can't pull the plug; I have a court order."
"You used to, but """,I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.
Not if no one's accusing you. All the charges have been dropped.,He doesn't have to die.
It's not Wegener's.,"If it's Wegener's, his lungs won't be able to handle it. As soon as they pull that plug he'll die."
He's still breathing.,It's not Wegener's. Wrong again.
"He's stable, but one of his arms is now paralyzed.","The real question is, why is he still alive?"
He's alive because you were wrong. It's not Wegener's.,"Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately. People keep living because of my mistakes."
Progression of the paralysis pretty much confirms Hamilton was right. It's ALS.,Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.
He can't move his arm.,"Yes, his arm is paralyzed. Yes, his legs are paralyzed. Why is Everyone so gung-ho to connect those two conditions? You could think I'm wrong, but that's no reason to stop thinking?"
How about this one? He's not our Patient.,"Nope, not good enough."
"He could have suffered a stroke when he was intubated. Well, blood clots are common in intubated Patients. The inactivity causes """,Not interested in why. Let's get an MR-angiogram for an embolic stroke.
He doesn't want you treating him!,They dropped the court order.
"Yeah, and that girl dropped the charges against Kobe. Doesn't mean that he should call her and see if she's free to get a sundae.","Good point, but I can go within 50 feet of him now."
Okay. Get outta here.,"Sure. That makes sense. You hate me for saving your life. In fairness to your side, you were also dying because of me, so """
You know I didn't wanna be saved.,"That's what's interesting. Your thyroid was low, but not low enough to cause depression."
"So, you came here to tell me that Even if I can't walk I can still hear the birds sing? Enjoy the rainbow, and feeling the sun shine on my face?","Those things are fun. Okay, life sucks. Your life sucks more than most. It's not as bad as some, which is depressing all by itself. But do me a favor. Just let me find out what's wrong with you. And if you still want to kill yourself, I'll give you a hand. That sound fair?"
"Yeah, sure. I'll stick around to indulge your obsession. It's over. I lost my air. The session the other night, with those kids? That was a test to see if I could still play. I can't.",And that's all you are? A musician?
"I got one thing, same as you.","Really? Apparently, you know me better than I know you."
"I know that limp. I know the empty ring finger. And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret. You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing. The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatEver. That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true. I got music, you got this. The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal. Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best. All we miss out on is Everything else. No Woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss, that ain't gonna happen for us.",That's why God made microwaves.
"Yeah, but when it's over, it's over.",Yeah.
What are you doing?,"It's not over for me. Either you're gonna call the cops again, or we're doing this. If you wanna die, you can do it just as easily inside an MRI maParkne."
"Listen, listen, I just think it wouldn't hurt him to learn a little humility.","So, what's the verdict?"
There's a good chance we can still bust the clot with tPA.,Do it. See what happens to his arm.
"I don't know, I guess! It's just with Dr. Hamilton here, I notice a difference in styles.",His style involves humility. Another difference in our styles: I don't care much for apologies. You can go.
"I didn't know you were standing there when I said that, okay? It was completely rude.","Do you mean genuine humility? You know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning, or Hamilton's polite, patronizing ""Aw, shucks"" humility?"
You're both excellent doctors.,Thank you. And humility is an important quality. Especially if you're wrong a lot.
You've been wrong Every step of the way.,"Of course, when you're right, self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it? We gotta go."
"Congratulations, Gregg.","Congratulations! Why, Marty?"
"Now look, I know we've had our differences, but I think when a person does something well it ought to be recognized.","The phone works. Next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy, leave a message. Don't get me wrong, I'm overcome with joy."
Yeah?,What?
You just touched my leg.,"What, you gonna charge me with assault again?"
"No, I felt it.","He now has feeling all the way up to calf. This is the way medicine evolved. Patients sometimes get better. You have no idea why, but unless you give a reason they won't pay you. Anybody notice if there's a full moon?"
You're saying he just spontaneously got better?,"No, I'm saying let's rule out the lunar god and go from there."
I'm sure he will.,It's one of ours.
How do we figure out which drug is doing the trick?,Easy. We stop all of them.
One of those drugs is helping him.,"And the rest? Steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, they're toxic if we leave him on all of them."
He'll walk again.,"Yeah, to his own funeral."
"But if we stop Everything, he'll get worse.","True. And then we'll add our medications back, one at a time. If he gets better, then we'll have our answer."
And if he doesn't get better?,Then we're in trouble. Not as much as he is. I suppose that was your point.
"I assume you want me to convince Hamilton to stop his treatments, too?",Don't care.
You know at least five of the medications are part of his protocol?,If his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago. It's our round of treatment that's helping.
"So your philosophy is, ""If they don't want treatment, they get it shoved down their throat, but if it might cure their paralysis, whoa, better slow down.""","Yeah. My old philosophy used to be ""Live and let live,"" but I'm taking this needlepoint class and they gave us these really big pillows."
What's your philosophy on employee relations?,That's a very tiny pillow.
Gregg. Can I have a word?,"Can it wait for the commercial, Marty? Say ""hi"" to my friend, Jimmy."
"Pleasure. Your diagnostic trial ""","Seriously, commercial's in about five minutes."
-- it's a dangerous game.,Only if we're watParkng in the bathtub.
I need to know exactly what medications you were giving John Henry.,"Forget it. And if Foreman tells you what John Henry used to be on """
You're gonna fire him?,Nope. Make him live out Every day of his two-year contract.
Foreman asked to leave?,Not yet.
"But how do you know I made him an ""","You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot."
I need to know what medications you've taken him off of.,"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!"
"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",He's getting worse. Right now you still work for me. Come on!
He's getting worse. Right now you still work for me. Come on!,"No feeling, no wiggling. The bad news is, John Henry's back where he started. The good news is, Hamilton looks bad."
"Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether the other guy loses.",What was the first thing we put him on?
"Steroids, for the pneumonia.","Well, put him back on them. Give them 24 hours, see what happens."
His lungs aren't great. It might cause another respiratory collapse.,Sure hope not. I didn't much like that Lawyer. And get an MRI.
He already got one. And an MRA.,"Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again. Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids. We should pRobably talk, huh?"
"He has to. If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman he needs him. House can't handle that. Oh, my God!",I checked him out. He's a great doctor. You think he's better than I am?
This about your ego?,"Answer the question. It's not going to change my opinion of myself. Might affect my opinion of you, but that shouldn't affect your opinion of yourself. Now I'm getting confused. If you think he's a better doctor than I am, then you should take the job. Otherwise, you should get him to buy you two or three more nostalgic lunches and politely decline."
It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?,"Oh, how do I abuse you?"
"How do you not? If I make a mistake ""","I hold you accountable, so what?"
Dr. Hamilton forgives. He's capable of moving on.,That is not what he does!
"I screwed up his case, he told me ""","He nEver said you were forgiven. I was there, he said it wasn't your fault."
So?,"So, it was. You took a chance, you did something great. You were wrong, but it was still great. You should feel great that it was great. You should feel like crap that it was wrong. That's the difference between him and me. He thinks you do your job, and what will be, will be. I think that what I do and what you do matters. He sleeps better at night. He shouldn't."
"Intradural, compressing his spine.",Causing his paralysis.
How could Hamilton have missed an AVM?,"Well, we missed it, too. 'Cause it wasn't there before."
You saying it just grew overnight?,"No. It was on the spine, it wasn't on the MRI. Same anatomic location."
It's not there.,"Well, what is there?"
Nothing.,Or something that looks like nothing.
"If it's inflammation, the steroids would have shrunk it down.","REvealing the AVM, which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling. We remove that, he'll walk again."
Dr. House! Cora's meeting me outside with a limo. I'm being discharged.,Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb.
Thanks for sticking with the case.,I can't do anything else. You're much more easily amused when you can walk.
How bizarre. I'm guessing you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine Even before your leg got messed up. I want you to have this.,Wow.
"You can sell it if you want to, just promise me you won't play it. How Many of those pills you taking?",I'm in pain.
"Yeah. Aren't we all? So, where do you buy these things, do they have cane stores?","Oh, don't worry about it. You'll be jogging before you need a second one. See you tomorrow, Eric."
He's wrong,"Foreman is wrong? The neurologist is wrong, about a neurological pRoblem?"
He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.,"So, you figure he's not being objective"
"House, the Woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.",Both of which Foreman saw?
He just wanted her out the door!,"Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman's the guy you want to take a swing at."
I - just - want her to get some medical attention.,That's not Even close to being true. Something else. Something personal. Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.
Brain tumor?,"Glad you could join us, Eric. What's the differential for a twitch in the wrist?"
"Yes, you've got that going for you. How could I have doubted your medical opinion?","The big question, you're missing it, all of you."
"Oh, geez.",Who is she?
"Most people wouldn't, you do.","The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe is that her name isn't Jane Doe. Which means no medical history. Allergies, medication, previous diagnoses, treatment "" we have no baseline, no context for medical treatment."
Wow. Looks just like insulin.,Vomit. Still moist. What do you think - a couple of days old?
Uhhh! trying to make me hurl?,Yeah. And here's the big finish!
Low magnesium could cause a twitch.,"Or high calcium. Or it's a coincidence. The point is, we don't know anything."
"So do the MRI. Find out ""","The MRI can wait. Hang a banana bag, give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance, we'll take it from there."
"Okay. Even if she's not faking, what's so fascinating about this case?","At the moment, how much you don't want me to take it. That's pretty fascinating."
I can't beliEve you authorized this.,Really? Sounds exactly like something I'd do.
"She can't have an MRI. The CT scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm, the MRI magnet would have ripped it out of her body. You like the Alien movies? You had no medical history, what were you thinking?","We'll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?"
She has an electrolyte imbalance.,"Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, beliEves this Woman has a brain tumor."
"Actually, I ""","Hey, don't Ever apologize for a medical opinion. If he's right, we don't do this test, the Patient dies. Now I realize that you have a specialty of your own, but does yours have anything to do with the brain? His does."
"How are we supposed to ""","Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us. Go check out the 'hood, dawg."
"Sure, she's not conning us, the MRI is.",Not wearing a coat in this weather. That is so wrong.
She drew these. They might give us a clue.,She sign them? Her name would be a start.
"All the mythology, the locations, they're all dependant on life experience.",Philadelphia. Look at that skyline! It's very evocative. The Chrysler Building.
And the Chrysler Building's in New York.,"Mmm! I'm getting Philly. And that cactus, well, that's a smashed car "" car accident."
A cactus in Philadelphia?,"Water "" well, water's October, right?"
Obviously.,"On the page number 22, so that's October 2nd, 2002. Ergo, the Patient was in a car accident two years ago last October."
My goodness! Was she okay?,"Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it "" with this."
"Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it "" with this.","Surgical pin. Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in case of recall, tied to a Patient's name."
That's why you insisted on the MRI. So you could remove the surgical pin from her arm.,"You didn't think I was going to do it to save your sorry ass, did you? You might want to take a look at that. Her name is Victoria Matson, at least that's the one she used then. Any hospital with the record of treating her should be sending that information."
"Well, we got her sedated and stabilized.",And we still think there's nothing wrong with her?
"Well, nothing's changed.","We almost killed her "" that's different. And we know who she is."
"Well, I'd be bummed out too. Zero degrees, living in a box.",Put her back on it. She cheers up; she might stop biting people
"And the cancer wouldn't account for the alleged twitch, or any other of her alleged symptoms.","Actually, it would. Neoplastic Syndrome associated with the cancer could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth. Ultrasound her ovaries."
Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?,No. Foreman was wrong. I'm starting to wonder about that guy's medical chops.
"The little ones are licking each other again, and Harry's got a seeping wart on his extra toe. What room should we go to?","You know, I think I might be coming down with something. Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry."
"Oh yeah. Just walk out, like I'm not going to do anything.",Bye-bye.
Working hard?,"This stuff's pretty good. Calendrica, works for the counseled genius. Bad guy's Mr. Fury, fairly generic, no special skills, but apparently very well organized. Think you work hard, try ruling the universe."
You trying to teach me something here?,"We've got the flowing dress, the ring. Think the Patient was married? Maybe it was a bad break up, maybe he dumped her cause she was on drugs."
You care about her personal history?,"Nope. Question is, why don't you? I hate to cite a cliché, but "" Dad on the streets?"
Dad's with Mom.,They're both living on the streets?
No! On a pension.,So who pissed you off?
"Pfft. Right now, you.","Your turn, you gonna tell me why this case?"
"She's my new girlfriend, I'm having a tattoo designed, I was hoping you could find out her name.",So she's just another sick person the kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure doesn't get lost in the big ugly system.
"Yes, I forgot, I need a reason to give a crap.",You're giving two craps.
Dr. House.,Time for Girl Scout cookies already?
"Since you're too sick to work in the clinic """,Okay.
- I thought you could do some teaParkng. Patient histories.,My specialty.
"When you teach, you learn so much, don't you think?",It's all about the giving back. Good old Cuddy. Always thinking. She assign you a Patient to interview?
Mmmhmm.,Then why are you still here?
Oh. I thought you were too sick to be down here.,"Had to get away from those students so I faked a page. Foreman's parents, happily married, 40 years."
Mazel Tov.,"Keinahora. So, why does he hate homeless people? If it's an uncle or a grandparent you'd think he'd use it in his college application essay. Family struggles beats a 4.0 GPA any day."
I think he had a 4.0,Maybe he's just a snob.
You really don't need to know Everything about Everybody.,"I don't need to watch the OC, but it makes me happy."
"Yeah, delirious. What's the other file?","Wilson, James. Boy wonder oncologist. You know him?"
"Did your pager really just go off, or are you ditParkng the conversation?",Why can't both be true? Come on.
You were right. There's nothing we can do for her here. Might as well put her back on the street.,Unless it's not cancer.
"Oh, you're joking.","Well, hard not to "" nothing funnier than cancer. But what if it's a tuberculoma. She's living out on the streets, breathing all kinds of crap 24/7. The odds are she's got TB, why can't she have a nice benign growth to go with it?"
A solid mass on her ovary. Ovarian cancer's way more likely.,"You're right. It's not Even close. Start her on INH, Rifampicin and Streptomycin."
But that's the treatment for a tuberculoma.,And what is the treatment for advanced ovarian cancer?
It's not a tuberculoma. Can't be.,I didn't know the biopsy was back.
"Her temperature's 105. Treatment's not working, it's cancer. She's dying.",105!
"It's the lab results from the biopsy, it's definitely a tuberculoma.","So "" we're right about the diagnosis, and the treatment for that diagnosis is killing her. Perfect."
The something else is gonna to melt her brain.,Poach. Better metaphor.
"Oh, just like you were going to do!","Okay you two, grab some scalpels and settle this like doctors. Send blood and urine cultures and get a chest x-ray. And fine, take her off Prozac and put her on Bromocryptin for the Serotonin syndrome."
Ple-ee-ease!,Continue.
Continue.,"And you're calling attention to your bosom by wearing a low-cut top. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were having a state-the-obvious contest. I'm competitive by nature."

"Nope. I'm supposed to be teaParkng you. If I can do that without listening, more power to me.",This guy's supposed to have universal power over all of gravity; how come his hair won't stay down? That's just stupid.
This guy's supposed to have universal power over all of gravity; how come his hair won't stay down? That's just stupid.,Hard to beliEve that one Patient could slip past Cuddy and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist. Two seems almost impossible - what room?
Room 2106,Patients lie. But usually only one lie at a time; how much does she weigh?
Patients lie. But usually only one lie at a time; how much does she weigh?,"Poundage, ladies, and by the by, what color is her nose?"
"Poundage, ladies, and by the by, what color is her nose?","Almost nothing. She's either under 90 pounds, or she has a red nose. I gotta go."
"Almost nothing. She's either under 90 pounds, or she has a red nose. I gotta go.","That would be telling. Oh, I am just too nice. It starts with 'C'."
So's the chest x-ray.,I assume there's a positive coming.
We know it's definitely an infection. And we know where it is.,"Well, meningitis is nice and simple. Get her in isolation and start her on Ceftriaxone. Either she gets better or she dies. Let me know which one happens!"
"Security tape confirms it, she stole some clothes and she's gone.","Wrong coat. The cape's in the closet, I had it cleaned."
Funny.,You gonna save her?

My wrist.,How did that happen?
I was riding the Ferris wheel and this huge seagull flew right at me.,How horrifying.
I'm not lying.,"Of course you are. You have no idea what happened. You have no memory. Korsakoff's syndrome. Her brain is damaged by excessive drinking or insufficient diet; pretty obviously the latter. She has no new memories, no new ideas, can't Even process that idea.

We must be wrong about the meningitis. Maybe it's structural heart disease.,Her heart rate dropped when you administered the Adenosine.
Two seconds.,It's still meningitis.
"If it is, with the delay in treatment, she's got almost no chance.",Start the treatment.
Read the report. I found her lying on the grass.,You should read my reports. I make up stuff all the time. What really happened?
"Oh, since it's you! I found her lying on the grass.",Wow. That is a great looking gun.
It's not a gun. It's a taser.,"It's so cool looking. What does it do? Fire about 60,000 volts? At least, that's what it would take to jack someone's heart up to 150s."
"Okay. Okay. Let's just say I tell you what happened. This stays between you and me, right? I found her. Lying. On the. Grass.","Fine. Don't tell me. Tell my friend, Ben Franklin. I watch a lot of cop shows."

Jerk. PRobably couldn't get to his real gun fast enough.,"The first time he hit her in the thigh, and she just kept going, like it was nothing. Right about here. She didn't feel the taser."
Localized numbness?,"Yeah, in that one spot."
The diabetes?,I don't think so.

What the hell?!,Can't get angry if you don't feel anything.
Can't get angry if you don't feel anything.,"First there's localized numbness, then sensitivity to light, disorientation, paranoia, ineffectiveness of sedatives, and then hydrophobia. Fear of water."
"There've only been, what, 20 cases in the last ten years?","Yeah. That's because non-homeless people, when they get bitten, they get shots."
How much time does she have?,"A day, maybe two. And if you don't get your shot in, say, the next three hours, I'm going to have to make another affirmative action hire."
Oh. You followed me?,"No. You were wearing rain boots today, but you were Parked in the underground garage, so the only reason you'd need boots was if you were hitting the streets! I followed you."
Didn't we have a conversation about friendship?,"Yeah. I had some follow up questions. I've met your parents, and your brother """

It's double what you were taking when I hired you.,'Cause you're twice as annoying.

You can't go a week without your drugs.,"No, I don't want to go a week without the drugs, it'll hurt."
"No, you can't. If you're just getting off pain medication, it will hurt, you won't be having a great time, but you'll make it. If you're detoxing you'll have Parklls, nausea! your pain will magnify five, ten times. You won't make it.","Well, I guess we'll nEver know."

Definitely not cancer.,Nothing?

"Excuse me, someone? Help, please?",Polite for a dying kid.
How long has it been?,I'm fine.
We have two hours to figure this out. Either we restore the blood flow or he loses the eye.,"Forget the eye. Tell him to use the other one to look on the bright side. The clot tells us something. It could help us figure out what he has, which could mean he gets to live. Differential diagnosis, people. How does internal bleeding suddenly start clotting?"
ANA was negative. It's not lupus.,This is true. But why are you the one saying it? What are you doing here? I thought we ruled out cancer.
I was lonely.,"Well, go see Cuddy. She needs a friend."
"That's funny, she said you might need one.","That's why you're here? She wants you to keep an eye on me, make sure I don't cheat."
"No, I want to make sure you don't start firing shots from the clock tower.",I'm fine.
Does your leg hurt?,You Ever been shot?
"There's gonna be side effects. Insomnia, depression, tachycardia ""","Withdrawal symptoms. Not applicable. The only side-effects I'm going to have are some pain and thirty days of freedom. Am I the only one who's concerned about a dying kid? If it's not lupus, what else?"
It's not an infection. Gallium scan didn't rEveal anything.,"Okay, what hides from a gallium scan?"
"Right. Clot slips off, travels through the artery, and gets backed up in the eye.","I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What happened?"
It's an infection. In his heart?,"Great. Echocardiogram for the heart and IV antibiotics for the infection, stat."

"Also, I have an idea for his eye.",Nothing we can do about his eye.

I wouldn't do that!,It's not drugs! His liver is shutting down.

What is your pRoblem?,"Bum leg, what's yours?"
His son's dying and you're mocking him?,It was a dumb question.

"Hemolytic anemia doesn't cause liver damage. Add the fact he's coughing blood, you've got three of the indicators of organ-threatening lupus.",It's moving too fast. Could be hepatitis-E.
There's only been one case of hep-E originating in the US since --,Its history. Since he's been in and out of the country four times in the last year!
You really think he's got hep-E?,No. I think the lupus is way more likely.
All right. Then let's start him on IV Cytoxan and plasmapheresis.,"No, we should rule out hep-E."
You just said it wasn't hep-E.,"I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E."
He's toast.,Exactly.
But there isn't a treatment for hepatitis-E. Either he'll get better on his own or he'll continue to deteriorate.,"Yeah, I went to medical school, too. Start him on solumedrol."
If he's got hep-E that's only going to make him worse!,"Not as much. Goldilocks, people. It won't hurt him so much that it'll kill him, and it won't hurt him so little that we can't tell. It'll hurt him just right. And if it does nothing!"
We'll know it's not hep-E and start treating him for lupus.,Now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water.
"What do we tell the dad? ""We think your kid has lupus, so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis-E? And oh yeah, if it really is hep-E, we're not actually giving him hep-E medication, so it's gonna make him worse, not better?""",You think he'll go for that?
So you want us to lie?,No. I want you to lie.
Why me?,Because he trusts you.
I think it's broken. What did you do?,Accidentally closed the car door on it.
No. Door would have broken the skin. This looks like something hard and smooth smashed it.,I want my Lawyer.
The brain has a gating mechanism for pain. Registers the most sEvere injury and blocks out the others. Did it work?,"Well, my hand hurts like hell. Yeah, I feel much better."
Huh.,Don't splint it. I want to be able to bang it against the wall if I need to administer another dose. Just! tape it up.
Why did you tell Cameron to lie to Mr. Foster?,Make it tight will ya.
Answer me.,"Nothing I could say is going to change how you feel, and nothing could come out of your reaction that is going to change what I plan to do, so I prefer to say nothing."
"So, that was you just saying nothing.",Uh-huh.
The guy is furious.,And scared.
"So, what are you going to do? The father's insisting on the lupus treatment.","Yeah, Cameron told me and I told her to tell him no."
"Well, you can't just sit back and let the kid die.",Neither can the father.
So that's your plan? You're gonna play Parkcken with the kid's life?,"Well, he's the dad. I should win easily."
Take the week off.,"What, 'cause I lied to a Patient? I take risks, sometimes Patients die. But not taking risks causes more Patients to die, so I guess my biggest pRoblem is I've been cursed with the ability to do the math."

That's what I told him.,And that's when he caved.
Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.,Two plus two equals four.
"Hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis, which is the fourth diagnostic criterion. It's official. This is lupus.",Who's Jules? Any mention of her in the medical history?
"It doesn't matter what he's hallucinating about, it matters why! It's lupus!","There's no need to get snippy. This kind of lupus takes years to get to this point, it's been a week."
"Yeah, and a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have hemolytic anemia, or be bleeding out of Every orifice, but he is. We had an opportunity to treat this, instead we diddled around with hepatitis-E and now it's too late. He needs a new liver. We screwed up.",You're saying I screwed up.
Yes.,Then why didn't you just say that?
You gonna just blame this on her?,Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep-E?
And she made herself quite clear.,And then she went and lied to the father. That's why you're angry.
"Yeah, I trusted you.",You always trust me. Big mistake. Lupus is a bad diagnosis.
It's the best diagnosis we've got.,That doesn't make it good.
"No, it just makes it this kid's only chance to live.","Put him on the transplant list. And make sure Cuddy knows, see if she can do anything to get him close to the top. Cafeteria. Stay away from the sushi."
And what happened to your hand?,Got stuck in a drawer.
"Yeah, right. You're going through withdrawal.","No, I am going through pain. Pain causes nausea."
"I took this job to work with you, not cover your ass. Your Vicodin.",And your solution is to give me drugs. It's interesting.
And hope for someone to die.,Who's Jules?
"Dr. House, you should get back to your office """,Jules. There's no Jules in the history.
It was a hallucination.,Of what?
Not long.,I don't think this is lupus.
"I don't think this is lupus. Come on, let's just go """,Your fourth diagnostic criterion of lupus is psychosis; this is just a kid missing his cat.
He was being attacked by an animal that wasn't in the room. That's psychosis.,There's a difference between psychosis and hallucination.
"So, if he was imagining a fake cat it'd be lupus, but since it was a real cat it's not? Take your damn pills.","Psychosis requires """
There's no cat! Jules is dead.,"You have a dead family pet, and you nEver mentioned it? Nice family history."
"Family history is asking about family members, meaning people related to the Patient. Let's go.",How did the cat die?
"Dr. House, come on, let's go """,What happened to the cat?
Old age. She was fifteen years old.,When?
"Does this have anything to do with """,Where'd she sleep?
This is not a cat allergy.,It's not lupus. Where is Jules?
Scalpel.,Stop the gases.
"What the hell are you doing, House?",Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar. This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis. He has acute naphthalene toxicity.
Naphthalene. You're talking about mothballs.,"Nope. Termites. They create naphthalene to protect their nests, which I'm assuming is rather large and is inside all four walls of his bedroom at home."
And your assumption is based on what?,The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.
Call Cuddy. And security.,You are not removing that kid's liver.
NOW! Have you completely lost your mind?!,"No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately. Achoo!"
"You've already cost him his liver, don't kill him too!",Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?
Healthy? He's in the toilet!,He just needs some Parkcken soup.
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub. We're doing this transplant.,"No, you're not."
They've only gotten worse.,If the food here wasn't one step below Riker's Island he would've gotten better. He's lost fourteen pounds.
"Yeah, sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.","Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas. The kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells. Outside the hospital his body burned protein and carbs for energy, and the naphthalene stayed in fat. But once the car accident put him in the hospital, and he started losing weight , his body had to get its energy somewhere else. It started to burn fat. The floodgates opened, the poison poured into his system."
"So, getting away from the poison is what poisoned him?",Getting him away from his dad's meatloaf is what's killing him.
Hey! Take it easy.,"Your cat did not die of old age. He died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure caused by naphthalene poisoning, the exact same thing your son has."
"You lie to me, you mess up my son's surgery, and now you expect me to trust you?","Give me twenty-four hours, we'll pump your son full of calories """
We're doing that surgery.,"If you do the surgery, you'll be killing a mother of four."
Father of three.,I was guessing.
Like you are now?,"Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what's wrong with your son. It explains the internal bleeding, the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure! it also predicts what'll happen next. If you do the surgery he's gonna lay on that table for fourteen hours while his body continues to burn fat and release poison into his system. Either way, I did you a favor. He's awake now, you've got a chance to say goodbye."
You made it a week.,And won my prize.
Congratulations.,Cuddy's a sucker. I would have done it for two weeks off.
"Yeah, it was a piece of cake. You learn anything?","Yeah, I'm an addict."
"Uh, okay.",I'm not stopping.
"There are programs. Cuddy would give you the time. You could get on a different pain Management regimen """,I don't need to stop.
You just said!,"I said I was an addict. I didn't say I had a pRoblem. I pay my bills, I make my meals. I function."
Is that all you want? You have no relationships.,I don't want any relationships.
You alienate people.,I've been alienating people since I was three.
"Oh, come on! Drop it! You don't think you've changed in the last few years?","Well, of, of course I have. I've, I've gotten older. My hair's gotten thinner. Sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means."
"No, I was there! You are not just a regular guy who's getting older, you've changed! You're miserable, and you're afraid to face yourself """,Of course I've changed!
And Everything's the leg? Nothing's the pills? They haven't done a thing to you?,"They let me do my job, and they take away my pain."
He's got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm.,"No, price is not a pRoblem if you have what I need. *Click*"
Osteo-,Young Man?
How did you know?,"Well, if he's an old Man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life, you make him comfortable, send him home, which means you're just boring me. So he's young, which means it's most likely caused by cancer, and you're here because you haven't found it. Have you looked really, really hard?"
MRI and PET scan are both negative.,"Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset."
"Well, let's see. Born 9/21/77.","It's Hank Wiggen? He signed it, sweet. ""To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine."" You ask for that?"
"I-just the Jimmy part. The bone's too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again. But if we figure out what's causing the osteopenia, we can rEverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.","Beat the Yankees, and save the free world."
Sorry I'm late. Car broke down on the interstate.,Don't beliEve you. Chem 7 also shows a poor kidney function. Now why would a guy in his twenties have a poor kidney?
"Cancer. It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.","Come on, people. He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1."
"You want it to be his kidneys, because if it's his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it's cancer, then he'll nEver pitch again. If this were a regular guy who came in and broke his arm lifting a box, you would've packed him up and sent him home!","My God, you're right, I lost my head. All life is equally sacred. And I promise you, the next knitting injury that comes in here, we're on it like stink on cheese. He weighed 175 his rookie year."
Stop.,Now he's 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why?
That'd explain the weight gain. And the kidney pRoblems.,"And the bone loss. Go ask him what he's on. When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup. If your car breaks down, you're an hour late, not two minutes. And two minutes isn't late enough to use a clEver excuse like car trouble."
I was coming in early.,"Huh. Unprompted lies, that's a bad sign. Either a guilty conscience or something personal's going on. See, that's all you had to do, Just walk in, sit down, do your job."
Uh!new guy.,"You need cash?!Ah, no, I, I don't have that much on me!No no, it's not a pRoblem. No, I'll be over by 6. 'Kay. *Click* 5 p.m., Dr. House checks out."
It's 4:45.,I was rounding up.
"Carol Moffett, please see Dr. House in Exam Room 1.","Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy."
It's Carol.,"Ah. Uh, trouble with the leg? When's the wedding?"
This Saturday.,"Not much time to fit into that pretty dress, and no time for practical shoe-shopping. You're running two miles a day further than you should be."
It hurts right here-,"New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the afternoon Cokes, you're gonna look beautiful. What's wrong with you?"
I can't get my contact lenses out-,Out of what? They're not in your eyes.
But they're red.,That's because you're trying to remove your corneas. What's wrong with you?
"Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that-","Yeah, yeah. Symptoms, we're working on a personal best here."
"Numbness in my feet and hands, constipation-",And?
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters-,"Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee! You're a dentist. Nitrous oxide poisoning, which means you're either dipping into your own supply, or you've got a bad valve in the office. Laughing gas rehab's pRobably more expensive than the plumber. Meanwhile, get yourself some B12. Who's left?"
"I can't see!Nah, I'm just screwing with you. It's a hangover, my English Lit prof. told me he'd fail me next time if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.","Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note, and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off."
"Elevated beta 2 proteins, though, could be cancerous. Amyloidosis, or lymphoma.",Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?
"He tested negative for steroids. I, um, I have a couple 20s on me.",50 of them? Foreman?
"The fat pad biopsy and abdominal CT scan were negative for the cancers, but-","Well, that just leaves us with steroids!"
He tested negative for steroids.,Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there's one thing they can't hide!
Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there's one thing they can't hide!,Hi. I'm Dr. House. And this is the coolest day of my life. See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles.
"I am clean, Man, no steroids, no nothing.","Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn't that a great word? Thanks, we don't get to say it nearly enough. Start him on Lupron right away."
"Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn't that a great word? Thanks, we don't get to say it nearly enough. Start him on Lupron right away.","These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them."
"He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids, then you're giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse?","!No, no, it's not. It-it's got calcium in it. It's very good for the bones. Basically, on a molecular lEvel, it's just milk. How long do you figure before I get a call from Cuddy?"
You put him on Lupron.,Uh-huh.
"And, you told them it was like milk.",Yes.
Is there any way in which that is not a lie?,"It's creAmy. But, I had 3 reasons."
Good ones?,"Well, we'll see in a minute, I'm just making them up now!He lied to me first."
Your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don't make a right.,"If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he's cured. Adds up for me-"
Second reason.,"If I told him the truth, he wouldn't have taken the stuff."
"And if he told you the truth, what would this stuff do to him?",!SEvere respiratory pRoblems.
Third reason.,I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.
Excellent! You and your Lawyer can write a paper.,Which brings me to my fourth reason.
I thought you said there were only three.,I thought you'd buy one of them.
Seriously?,He's not gonna sue.
"Because his Lawyer is a nice guy, who realizes it's unfair to blame us for ruining this kid's hundred million-dollar career.","Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory pRoblems, it means he's not on steroids, which means there's something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad."
"Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory pRoblems, it means he's not on steroids, which means there's something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad.","Osteopenia messing his bones up. Hypogonadism. Impaired liver function, kidney function, and!we have Managed to find the only professional athlete in the galaxy who is not on steroids. AND it's not cancer. So, what's killing him? Who shares my suspicions that the Yankees were somehow involved?"
Shrunken testicles indiCate his body's not putting out enough testosterone.,"Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don't worry, I'll send him a nice note."
"What about something environmental? Arsenic, mercury, the symptoms could indiCate-","Pretty small environment. Wife's fine, no one else is sick."
"If you throw out the kidneys, Everything else adds up. The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function, could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.","Addison's disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is!"
Steroids.,Enough irony for all of us.
"Treatment would cause him to retain fluid. With the kidneys almost shut down already, he'll die.","Well, we'll get him a new kidney."
Your theory is that Addison's is causing all the symptoms except for the kidney pRoblems. What's causing the kidney pRoblems?,"Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now?"
Negative for steroids.,"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage."
"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage.","You see, kidneys don't wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn't matter, 'cuz kidneys can't tell time. Steroid damage could take years."
No steroids. How Many times does he have to tell you?,I don't know. How Many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league?
That is completely different.,"Oh, that's right, I remember. You nEver did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a Lawyer-"
"If Hank says he nEver used steroids, that's the truth.","That's too bad. Because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by A, and Everything else is caused by B. The beauty of this theory is that we can treat A and B. But if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix, then we are looking at another letter altogether, one that is apparently not in the alphabet. Can't fix the bones, no more baseball, no more breathing!no more brain function."
Get another explanation.,Okay. Yeah. Think I've got one in my other pants.
"Hold on. Five years ago, Bangor, Maine. My pitParkng coach had me on something, I nEver knew what it was.",And you nEver tried too hard to find out either.
How you doin' Doc?,"Good. Very good, yeah."
You want me to put Hank Wiggen on the transplant list.,He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some.
"Well, they like to save them for people who have-how do I put this- kidney pRoblems.","He's a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions. Do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die?"
"That's a great idea, we can be the hospital that killed two people. The guy who deserved the kidney, and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren't Even sure what was wrong with him.",Everything else is related to the Addison's.
The test for Addison's was inconclusive.,The test for Addison's is always inconclusive.
Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you.,You're not putting him on the list.
Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.,You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down.
"It's what I live for. Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day. Ask me something I can say ""yes"" to.","Oh, I'm sorry Doctor, I didn't know you were busy. Want me to come back?"
Is he on the list?,No.
Then I'm giving him one of mine.,!Okay.
You're not gonna tell me it's a bad idea? Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it?,"Not my area. That is, howEver, my chair."
When do we do it?,"Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match-"
Do you live alone?,You writing a book?
"I made it a question just because it's more polite. You got a big ""Keep Out"" sign stapled on your forehead.","That explains it, I told them to put it on my door."
"Even if real huMan contact is something you don't have or Even want, or need, you should at least be able to see it in other people.",Yeah. Right. True love. That's just how we match organs these days. There's a couple in France-high school sweethearts-they're trading brains.
Or needs a thousand bucks. What is with that?,"I scored. It's a brave new world, Doc, and we are at the cutting edge. You are looking at two all-access passes to Paradise itself!"
How much?,"True cost, no Man can say."
Could that Man's accountant say?,One thousand dollars. Friday night-the biggest official monster truck jam in the history of New Jersey!
"Okay, please tell me you didn't just say Friday night.","WhatEver you've got, you cancel."
I-I can't do it!,"Listen, they only give these tickets to owners. Anytime. We wanna be in the middle of the track, we're in the middle of the track. These tickets are so good!we have to sign a release. I mean it. We do this, we could die."
"I've got the oncology thing! I-I!The rectal cancer lecture, they booked me a year ago! I-I-I-I-I can't get out, there's no way out!","Fine. I'll ask one of my other friends. What, you're saying I've only got one friend?"
"Uh, and who!?","Kevin, in Bookkeeping."
"Okay, well first of all, his name's Carl.","I call him Kevin. It's a secret ""friendship club"" name."
"If you have the results, I'd like you to talk to both of us. If you don't, wait for me to-","BeliEve me, I'd much rather be with your better half. And by better half, of course, I mean the one who struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches and talks a lot less. But I thought I would talk to you first, and alone. I got your results back from the lab!you DO match."
"I, I do?",You're also pregnant. You can't be a donor. Not in your current condition.
Foreman says we've got a pRoblem with the transplant.,"If she terminates the pregnancy, he's not going to let himself die on principle."
!Would you give up a baby for someone you love?,"Please tell me I don't have to decide. Depends, how long would they live?"
Is this a pragmatic question for you?,"Fifty years, no pRoblem. Six months, I say let 'em die. Well, I've actually given this a lot of thought, and my personal tipping point is sEven years, eight months, and 14 days."
I couldn't do it.,You found religion.
Do you have to be religious to beliEve a fetus is a life?,"There seems to be a correlation. I'm, uh! Do you like monster trucks?"
!I don't know what they are.,!Right. I got two tickets. Friday night.
You asking me to go with you?,Sure. Sounds good.
Like a!date?,"Exactly. Except for the ""date"" part. Forget it."
"No, I-I was gonna go to the oncology dinner!","'Course, you have to hear Wilson's lecture."
"His heart rate is 130 and rising, like a Randy Johnson line drive.",A for effort.
Heart rate's down to 40.,I thought it was up.
What's wrong?,I have no idea. Hit him with the atropine before he gets to 35 again.
We've already given him 3 ml.,"Apparently, that's not enough."
We can't stabilize his heart rate.,What did you do to him?
It wouldn't do this.,But something did. Call me when he's stable!or dead.
"I'll just try one, Warner.","Three more symptoms. Heart rate up, heart rate down, now he's hallucinating."
He's not just dreaming?,No REM. He's actually awake.
Drugs?,"Not psychedelics, not with the heart symptoms."
"All hallucinations would point to digitalis. It would also mess up his heart. But, he's not on it, and why would he take it?",!Yeah. Pithy analysis. I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner. I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.
I'm sorry about the monster trucks.,"No, I think it's great. You're!giving back."
"Sure, it's got a lotta movement, pRoblem is Everybody sees the movement. Yer throwing yer curve ball, like yer throwing a curve ball. Deception, that's it. Same motion, less movement, so it won't come back at ya. How'd you get in here?",Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican.
How's Hank doin'?,"Lousy. Around your fingernails, that swelling, it's called clubbing. Hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends who also had that, tended to frequently grab their chests and die."
"Yeah, I got a heart condition. What's wrong with Hank?",What do you take for it?
Digitalis.,Got 'em with you?
That's weird. I just filled this prescription a couple days ago. There's another bottle here.,Don't bother. Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself.
Don't bother. Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself.,"So what happened? He left the bottle open, while he went to get some water? Next time, just take the whole bottle."
"Hey Man, you got no right-","See, people remember how Many they've got. Date's right on the label, number of pills, regular person can do the math. But a junkie doesn't have to. It's how Many pills he's got left, that's all he's thinking about. Bought a big insurance policy?"
This isn't about the money.,"Not for you, no. Most reputable stores won't cash your checks after you're dead. But for Lola-well, girls like that, they're all about the money-"
"Don't you say that. She already saved my life. I was dead in Japan and she brought me back, Everything since then, that's gravy, it's more than I deserve.",You owe her.
Everything.,"So, the attempted suicide, the scaring her to death, that's-what is that, that's-gratitude? Love? Yeah, I get that. We'll take out what you did to yourself yesterday, we're back to the kidneys and the bones. I'm scheduling the transplant. NEveR visit a Patient."
"I want that baby! Even if I'm gone, that's a piece of me, and Lola. Breathing. Walkin' around town. Goin' to baseball games.

I'll take myself out for good.","I'll start treating the Addison's, which will most likely destroy what's left of your kidneys-"
Hey.,Hank Wiggen peed on me. What d'you think these pants are worth on eBay?
"I've got some big-boy diapers in my office, the rep. hands them out like candy.",Is it that bad?
No! Not if you like the smell of urine-,"'Course, why should I trust someone who lies about what he's doing Friday night? Question is, what are you really doing Friday night? Or more to the point, what could possibly be better than monster trucks? Or are we breaking up?"
"!Stacy's coming into town this weekend, we're having dinner. Just!catParkng up.","I definitely had pants here. Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper? I heard she's playing Atlantic City."
"No, Stacy the Constitutional Lawyer.",You thought I couldn't handle this news. You talk to her a lot?
No. It's been a long time. If you don't want me to see her-,"What is this, eighth grade? I'm fine."
!It's fine if you're upset-,No! It's! I have no right to be upset. You two are friends. You should see her. Say hi for me.
So!you're okay.,"I'm not the cancer doctor who's lying about the cancer dinner. I'm not the one who's betraying all those!bald-headed dying kids. I'm gonna go get some pants, I stink."
You're treating him for Addison's and you don't think it's gonna work?!,He tried to kill himself.
"I know. He's confused. We can have another baby, I can make him understand that. I'm having an abortion. We do the trans-",No.
I can make decisions about my body.,And he can make decisions about his. He doesn't want your kidney.
So!he'll die?,!PRobably.
!PRobably.,"If you keep that appointment, he'll also pRobably die. Keep the baby."
"If you keep that appointment, he'll also pRobably die. Keep the baby.","!Are you just being polite? See, my pants are!"
"Oh, they're all wet.",!You can't smell that?
"Oh God, do we have to go to the lecture?","So, you're the new Arnie."
"Dr. House. It's, uh, good to see you.","Would you get me a coffee? Black, no sugar. Okay, so who is it? Come on, she's sleeping with one of you. Oh God, please tell me it's you."
She buys lunches! She doesn't-,"Don't worry, you're not gay!you're adventurous!"
You think she's gonna prostitute herself? The three of us are that important to her?,"I'm afraid not, no. The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick."
And!you're Mick?,"That was the metaphor I was making, yes."
Why are you here?,"Damn, it's you. It's not Addison's. New symptom: the inability to smell."
"I was just in Hank's room, and he said it smelled like the men's room at Veteran's Stadium. He was right.","We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy. Well, she's not. Last six months, she can't smell a thing. If you think of them as one single Patient, add her symptoms to his!"
Cadmium poisoning.,It explains Everything. Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant.
Unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast.,"So, where else is cadmium?"
How'd the ballplayer doing?,Much better.
Too bad about his career.,What d'you mean?
Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement requires medical reports on all treatment. Given Hank's history he's not likely to get much leniency.,Why should they care that he's being treated for Addison's?
You're not treating him for Addison's!,My report says I am.
You're lying on the report?!,"Everybody does stupid things, it shouldn't cost them Everything they want in life."
That was amazing!,"I'm telling you, Gravedigger nEver disappoints."

Twelve-year-olds don't have sex.,Their mistake. That's it? Other possibilities?
What if you're thinking about this backwards?,"The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice."
"New Jersey, it's most likely Lyme disease.",All right. Let's keep him on fluids and cefuroxime to be safe. And biopsy that rash. And take another history. Even if we don't learn what's causing this we definitely need to know if twelve-year-olds are getting any action.

Urgent doctor stuff.,"26-year-old male, sudden loss of the ability to speak --"
Just because you got out of clinic duty doesn't mean Everybody did.,-- to his father. Differential diagnosis?
Chase?,"Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out."
Dad say why he was here?,See? You asked. Dad comes 5000 miles and you're more curious than Junior is. Can't just be about the divorce. It's been fifteen years and mom's been dead for ten of them. You think Daddy murdered her?
"You want to get to the bottom of this, you're doing it exactly right. Don't talk to the people involved, drag your buddy away from work for some pointless speculation.","You want to know how two chemicals interact, do you ask them? No, they're going to lie through their lying little chemical teeth. Throw them in a beaker and apply heat."
Even I don't like you.,"You know, words can hurt!"
"Felt. Fibers are made of what, cotton?","Hah, hah hah. Sorry, forgotten how funny your dad was."
Not as funny as you.,"High praise. I know how protective kids can be of their parents. Not cotton, animal hair. Get the CT scan. First, find the name of the company that made the insulation and second, tell me what I'm seeing that makes me want to short their stock."
Purile effusions.,"Less obvious, more scary."
"Slightly widened. Oh God, it can be transmitted through infected animal hair. But the gram stain would have shown ""","No, the cefuroxime would have killed some of it, clouded the result."
What does he have?,Anthrax. This House belonged to old Man Hussein?
He's okay.,Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?
You really think he's allergic to two antibiotics?,I want to know what Dr. Chase thinks.
"It's possible to think he's allergic to both anti ""","Oh, I'm sorry! Not you. Understandable mistake. The other Dr. Chase."
Necrosis can theoretically take as long as two weeks.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, it's not a competition! It's a diagnosis! Okay, who thinks Junior wins? Four to one, it's not anthrax. So we start over, what's changed? What do the nodules tell us?"
Sarcoidosis.,"Excellent. Send an ACE lEvel. If it comes back positive, put him on methotrexate."
"Call the Lancet, because that's one bizarre allergic reaction.","Come on, there's no reason you both can't be wrong. It's not allergy, but it's not coincidence, either. Disease number one set off disease number two."
Anthrax weakened his immune system.,And triggered a dorMant sarcoidosis. Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start him on methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.
Fine.,Better go with him. Make sure he doesn't snap and hurt somebody.
You're being funny?,Apparently not.
You know why I give money to this hospital? It's the only way to get attention. You see this?,"Is this a magic trick? Because I am a total David Copperfield fan, although that ""Tornado of Fire,"" that seemed a little fake """
"Pain in the wrist. Won't go away for months. Six doctors' brilliant conclusion is to take it easy. I write a check, name goes on a plaque, and forty-eight hours later I've got two MRIs, a bone scan, and a diagnosis: carpal tunnel. I'm in surgery that afternoon.",Fascinating story. You thought of adapting it for the stage?
"I love my "" look at me! "" love my son, love him more than anything else in the world, and you're going to start paying attention to this case, or I'm going to make things miserable for """,Go back to your son's room.
"I'm not leaving here until you get your ass in gear """,There's a pRoblem.
"Uh, he has clinic duty this morning.","No, he doesn't. I rescheduled you guys so you'd be free."
Keep going.,You page me?
"No, I don't need you.","Oh, come on. We all need help now and again. You're getting a consult. Okay, we've got new skin lesions, bigger and uglier. What would cause that?"
"Gabe's dad found leishManiasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday. They didn't fit then, but now they kind of do.","Sure, except for the nodules and we're not working out of Calcutta General."
The only reason you're thinking auto-immune is because you're a rheumatologist! If you were a proctologist you'd think rectal cancer.,Gotta go with Senior. He literally wrote the book on this one.
"And 100 mg. of cytoxan, it treats most auto-immunes.","We'll give it to him now, before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs."
Hey! My fingers are numb!,Your watch is on too tight.
You're messing with my head.,Your relationship with your dad is messing with your ability to do your job.
Only because you made my dad part of my job.,"Good point. Haven't seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you """
Pacific.,You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna at the airport. You don't Even ask why he's in town.
It's pRobably a conference.,"PRobably. I was hoping to do this by sheer Manipulation, but if you insist on talking, fine, talk. What did he do to you?"
How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life?,I'd hate it. That's why I clEverly have no personal life.
I'm going to biopsy his skin lesions.,Good thinking! Prove your dad wrong. That'll solve Everything.
I've got to talk to House about this treatment.,But the Patient's getting better.
In spite of the cytoxan.,"On the other hand, getting better."
Cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection. The anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.,Better!
"You want a negative test for Every auto-immune disease known to Man? Fine, I'll get them!",Be home by midnight or he can't have the car this weekend. You guys talk? Did he tell you why he's here?
The SLE conference.,Going back to the conference?
Afternoon panel. I hope I can stay awake.,"I hope you can get in. You're not registered. I get it. You had to make up a lie. Can't just tell your kid you're here to see him. What father does that? That little blue dot under your collar. It's a tattoo for guiding radiation treatment. I was looking for it after I saw what you had for breakfast: brown rice and vegetables, macRobiotic diet. Popular with Hollywood starlets and cancer Patients."
"Lungs, stage four.",You look good.
"I'm not. Came to the States to go to Sloan-Kettering, and to see Dr. Wilson.",What'd he say?
Three months.,But you haven't told Robert. You don't want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad.
I'd prefer you not tell him.,"Yeah, it's better. I'll get to see his face when he reads his dad's obituary."
It's not your business.,I suppose it isn't.
"If we don't stop the nerve deterioration quickly, he'll be paralyzed for life.","Well, luckily, at this rate, that should only last about a week. Okay, so """
Robert was right. You said multiple neurofibromatosis.,"Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved?"
Fits better.,Too bad. I was hoping for the other reason. I was gonna go get my camera. Get a CT scan. His brain this time.
One's always been more than enough for me.,Why didn't you tell me that Rowan Chase was in to see you?
"Excuse me. Ethics, confidentiality? Does any of this ring a bell?",You could have covered yourself. Called me in for a consult.
It is a juicy piece of gossip. You know what happened? I got all focused on his cancer and lost perspective.,"You can't tell Chase, but I can. What should I do?"
Oh! This is where I give you advice and pretend you're going to listen to it. I like this part. Did Rowan ask you not to tell?,"I promised I wouldn't. My fingers were crossed, though, so I'm wide open."
I was wrong! This is the musing-out-loud part! Do I actually need to be here?,"Telling him, now that's got real entertainment value."
"Hmmm, he might Even cry. On the other hand, there is the ""do unto others"" thingy.",Then I should definitely tell him! I'd want to know.
"You want to know Everything. There's also the ""keeping your promises"" thingy.","Oh, you nEver run out of thingies. Like that blonde thing you were chatting up."
She's the hospital accountant! We were going over billing procedures!,Double-entry bookkeeping?
What are you going to do?,"Billing procedures. They're so compliCated, aren't they?"
"No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing. It's not neurofibromatosis.","Drs. Chase are 0 "" 3. Even when they agree they're wrong. So, next. What else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?"
"Doesn't matter. His lesions are in the wrong place, his feet are the one clear spot.",Kid's dad mentioned leishManiasis.
"Yeah, and filariasis, but the throat nodules still don't fit with that.",Two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia. What if the anthrax didn't set off the second disease?
We're back at coincidence again?,No. What if something else was the trigger?
Nothing else happened.,We happened.
"We've been through this, it's not an allergy.",I've gotta pee.
What did the CT scan tell you?,Nothing.
Ow!,"On a scale of one to ten, how painful?"
About half as painful as when I punch you in the face.,Don't do that. It'll hurt you. Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work.
Who are you?,The little ones call me Uncle Gregg. Your dad nEver had carpal tunnel. You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How'd you know about them?
I read about them on the internet.,"So, what'd you search for? ""Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms""? You heard about them in Asia."
I've nEver been there.,"Well, you pRobably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory. Some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year! starting to come back?"
"Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?","Your dad's pissed off. He should be. Comes here, expecting us to do an extra good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital """
Don't talk to my son like that!,"Just telling him my job, my obligation to this """
Stop! What's going on?,"There's only one thing that you guys have got to do. Tell the truth, or your son will die. How long were you in Asia?"
What does this have to do with my son?,"Clue number one: If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine."
Demonic possession?,"Close, but no wafer. Clue number two: Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes auto-immune symptoms."
"Yeah, that's real big in the Jersey suburbs.","It's leprosy. Run a FITE stain, it'll be positive. Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram."
"But it's obviously dorMant in the dad, how could the kid catch it?","It's not dorMant in the dad, it's just slow. Damaged his ulnar nerve, was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel. NEver trust doctors. Run a FITE stain."
No wonder he got anthrax. The leprosy weakened his immune system.,"Vicious circle. The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax, and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive."
"But the antibiotics we gave him, they cure leprosy.","Yeah, that's where the trouble starts. The antibiotics hit the nerve strands, they kill the leprosy bacteria. The corpses get tossed into the system. And as fascinating as our bodies are, they're also stupid. They produce antibodies to beat dead bacteria. And these aren't the polite antibodies, they're the ones that won't sit still; kick during naptimes. They attack his neural and fat cells, cause some inflammation and all the rest of his symptoms."
So the cure's killing him!,"I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48. Get them to send up some thalidomide."
Thalidomide?,"Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right? So he can't be pregnant. Make the call. I need to speak to your boy."
Why does Everybody need to know my business?,"People like talking about people. Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care."
"I'd tell you my dad left, my mum drank herself to death! you gonna care about me more?","Cameron would. Me, I just like knowing stuff. I know you hate your dad, but I'm gonna tell you something """
"I don't hate him. I loved him until I figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. You don't expect him to turn up to your football match? No disappointments. You don't expect a call on your birthday, don't expect to see him for months? No disappointments. You want us to go make up? Sink a few beers together, nice family hug? I've given him enough hugs. He's given me enough disappointments.",Okay.
That's it?,That's it.
I need a doctor. I can't move my leg!,"32-year-old female, paralysis and sEvere pain in her right quad. Go."
How'd she get to you?,She's the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics. Three assistants and fifteen VPs checked out who should be treating her. Who da Man? I da Man. I always suspected.
"Dr. House, I beliEve that they're right, and """,Stop talking.
What?,"You read one of those negotiating books, didn't you? ""Getting to Yes: Fifty Ways to Win an Argument."" ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to Being a Pal."" In five seconds you just Manipulated these two into agreeing with your point of view. Fellas, this is known as ""soft positional bargaining."" It's not gonna work."
"Dr. House, are you saying that she doesn't have a clot or are you saying that if she does have a clot she doesn't need blood thinners and an angiogram?","Chase, put her on blood thinners, do an angiogram. When that comes back negative, MRI the spine. If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg."
Excellent suggestion.,"Read less, more TV."
Hmm.,"Say ""ah""."
Ah.,"No, really belt it out, like you're gonna throw up."
Ah!,"Perfect. Okay, that's it. We should know in a couple of days what's growing in your son's throat. Hello?"
He can't talk.,Excuse me?
He had knee surgery.,Right!
"About a year ago, and then he couldn't talk.","Right, yeah, well, that happens. You know, it's very dangerous operating so close to the vocal chords. Okay, well, we'll send your kid's culture to the lab and somebody will call you. BOO!"
AAH!,"Just wanted to see if your dad, uh, sorry."
I need you to wear your lab coat.,I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. Like half your age.
Wear the coat.,Man oh Man. Someone got spanked real good this morning.
"Guy gives $100 million to cure cancer, pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.",Cure cancer. Is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating Patients?
You know that's not what he's doing.,I know exactly what he's doing. He's using us to run clinical trials.
"Oh, shame on him! Saving lives like that!","It's unethical. Oh, are you coming in, too? I thought I had you convinced."
Clinical trials save thousands of lives.,He's using Patients as guinea pigs.
Pharmaceutical companies do that Every day.,"Are we a pharmaceutical company? We're gonna wind up pressuring desperate Patients into choices that are bad for them, good for us. You're gonna compromise Patient care."
Who the hell am I talking to? Suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?,What's interesting is it suddenly doesn't bother you.
"So, if you ignore ethics to save one person it's admirable, but if you do it to save a thousand you're a bastard. All he's done is taken your game and gone pro.",He's not going to kill a few Patients. He's going to kill this hospital.
We should introduce ourselves. It couldn't hurt.,Make him a bundt cake. Patient hit a ten on the pain scale. What would explain that?
"There was no clot in her leg, the angio was totally clean.",What about the muscle biopsy?
My Aunt ELisalives in Philiadelphia.,"Oh, it's storytime! Let me get my baba."
"Her normal temperature is 96.2, not 98.6 like you and me. If her temperature were 98.6, she'd have a fEver. I'm just wondering if you think we could apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.",That's absurd. I love it.
"If 15 is high for Carly, then she has inflammation.","Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I'll talk to Wilson. Next time, skip Aunt Elisa."
"You're pRobably talking about a primary bone cancer. Can be tricky to detect, you'll need a bone scan """,That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.
"Sure, I've nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports! new ChairMan of the Board, you know.",Oh! I hadn't heard.
Right. Clinical trials!,Completely unethical.
And a very bad omen for you. There's not much money in curing African sleeping sickness.,"No, I have seen Every scary movie Ever made. Six-year-old twins in front of an elevator of blood, boys' choirs: those are bad omens. This is much more mundane: a billionaire wants to get laid."
Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid. They buy hospitals to get respect.,And the reason you want respect?
To! get laid.,"Okay then. You've just gotta think like a billionaire. Let's see, big scary changes, and then, ""Oh, Dr. Cameron, we should have dinner to discuss your future on my G-5 private jet."""
"Oh, come on. You know how good you have it here.","Yes, I'm the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy."
"You do the cases you want to do, when you want to do them. You're not going to get that anywhere else.","Relax, I've been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time, same story."
"Just keep your head down, that's all I'm saying. And put on your coat.","It itches. So, are you going to do this bone scan for me or what?"
Yes.,"Dr. Simpson! Did you hear? New Management. I'm thinking about switParkng to orthopedics. How much do you guys get for massage now, without the happy ending?"
"Dr. House, what do you want?",You remember a guy named Van Der Meer? Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.
"Well, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.",Didn't get hypertensive during surgery? No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?
"What, you're going to get involved now?",I'm not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.
I didn't touch the son. I'm not taking any responsibility there.,The son's fine. Can't shut him up. The dad show any signs of cortical disease? Wernicke's?
"No. Nothing. And that's why we settled; because we couldn't find anything. The guy got over a million dollars, don't tell me he's complaining.","He's not saying ""boo""."
"There is another way. We could do a virtual colonoscopy. Basically, we do a CT scan of your colon. It's non-invasive, but it's very expensive. I assume that's not a pRoblem. Say yes.","Mr. Van Der Meer. What? Relax, Ricky's going to be just ""finkf"". Strep throat, here's a prescription for an antibiotic. He should be all better in a few days. Although, this might sting a little. I want to see you again real soon."
Virtual colonoscopy was clean. No colon cancer.,What happened to a regular old-fashioned colonoscopy?
She was uncomfortable doing any more tests! I had to convince her to do that one!,Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?
She's scared.,But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.
Yeah.,"It's not an inflammatory process, it's not a clot because Chase's angio says so, and it's not cancer because her toosh is perfect. Anybody else got an Aunt ELisawith weird stuff?"
"Maybe it's worth looking into """,I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.
It was clean.,You guys see the pRoblem here?
"There's no indication of any abnormalities. No lesions, no spurs, no masses """,Her toes are screwed up. They're backwards. Do you guys know how much surgery it's going to take to swap them back?
What are you talking about?,Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.
"That's impossible. It can't be the wrong """,Or maybe it was Jenny! How come some resident signed this radiology form? Were you Even in the room?
"I'll redo her angio straight away ""","You'll do nothing! Foreman, you do the angiogram."
"Foreman did a thoracentesis to drain the fluid from her lungs. They sent the fluid to the lab, it'll be back in a few hours. You'll be happy to know that Chase's mistake didn't cost her. Angio rEvealed no clot.",I'm thrilled.
"Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn. It's cold, perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.",Carly needs a heart transplant.
Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate?,Haven't gotten it back yet.
"Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fracture? Maybe you could treat it, surgically.",Haven't done the MUGA.
How do you know she needs a heart transplant?,I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.
Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?,I can't tell you anything. Professional responsibility.
Like that matters to you.,"Not my professional responsibility, yours. New regime, you gotta keep your head down, too."
"Now, that's good thinking, because I was going to go right to Cuddy and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.","I'm not saying you want to, I'm saying you'd be obligated to."
"Because of my position on the Board? Because of my position on the transplant committee? Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.",I can't.
You sure you're doing the right thing?,I've come up with a few really great rationalizations.
"Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate. We did an echo. She's in sEvere congestive heart failure. She needs a heart transplant. We'll get her on the list immediately """,She's already on the list.
"You're Dr. House. I found a picture of you online at a conference """,You need a heart transplant.
"I run, I work out, I ""","You cut yourself. PRobably highly ritualized. You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin song over and over while you do it, pRobably works better than anti-depressants."
"I don't understand how that has to ""","You're a high-powered bulimic. You make yourself throw up. You have to find the most efficient way to vomit without rEvealing the tell-tale signs of bulimia, which is all, eugh. Very unseemly, for a CEO. So, you found a common antidote for accidental poisoning to do the job: ipecac. Which is great, if your kid's just swallowed a bottle of aspirin, but really, really bad if it's a habit. It causes muscle damage. It caused the pain in your leg. And it destroyed your heart. How often do you do it?"
Three times a week.,"In about an hour, there's going to be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available. PRoblem is, I am required to tell the committee of your bulimia, it's a major psyParkatric condition. Ranks right up there with suicidal, makes you a very bad risk."
So you're here to tell me I have just a few hours to live?,"Unless I lie to the committee. But if they find out, I lose my medical license. This would be a very good time to offer me a bribe. How much is your life worth, how much is my job worth """
Why are you here doing this to me? What do you want?,I want to know what's right.
"Am I worth it? You think I'm pathetic. Has a good job, Everything in the world, but she just doesn't like the way that she looks ""","Oh, stop hiding! I'm asking you if you want to live or die, you can't Even say that!"
What do you want me to do? Cry?,"Yes! I want you to tell me that your life is important to you, because I don't know! Because that's what's on the table right now: your life."
I don't want to die. I don't.,"This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh. Patient rapidly deteriorated and now has sEvere congestive heart failure. Pressers and vasodilators have not improved her conditions whatsoEver. Pulmonary function tests show an FVC of over 3 liters with EDD-1 of at least 90% of predicted. And preserved FEB/FEC ratio and preserved DLCO as well. Her MUGA had an ejection fraction of 19% with no focal wall or motion abnormalities. Heart catheterization rEvealed clean left, right and circumflex arteries, and subsequent biopsy rEvealed irrEversible cardiomyopathy. Which is why we're here."
"Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused by your time and date stamps. It appears that you put Carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.",I had a hunch.
You don't have hunches. You know.,"Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the lists, but on the long shot! On the long shot I was right, I didn't want to waste time."
Is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?,CAT scan rEvealed no tumors and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.
What about any other criteria?,"No atherosclerotic vascular disease """
"Are there any ""","No pneumonia, no bacteriemia, no Hep-B or C or any other letters."
"Substance abuse? Any history of ""","No alcohol, no drugs."
"Any psyParkatric conditions, history of depression ""","She's a little blue, but turns out she needs a heart transplant."
"Dr. House, if you subvert or mislead this committee, you will be subject to disciplinary action.","Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason to think that I would lie?"
I simply want you to answer the question! Is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria that would disqualify your Patient from getting a heart?,No.
No.,Beautiful organ donor weather.
"You lied, didn't you?",I nEver lie.
Big mistake.,Then you should have voted against putting her on the list.
You're my friend.,"Oh, jeez. Have some backbone. If you think I'm wrong, do something."
"Wait, you're getting mad at me for sticking up for you?",You value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities.
Our friendship is an ethical responsibility. What is it?,My Patient's getting a heart.
"They just stopped Carly's heart. And your dumb Patient ""","They're all "" oh, the guy who can't talk."
"Mr. Van Der Meer, he scheduled an appointment to see you.","Oooh, goody."
I wanted you to know Chase is worried you're going to fire him.,"It's bad enough that screw-ups cost lives. Now we've got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs. I want Chase scared. I want him doing Everything he can to protect his job."
"Dr. House, if you were in his position wouldn't you be more likely to perform well if you were reassured and ""","Oh, will you stop it with the book! Why are you doing this?"
I'm not doing anything.,You're Manipulating Everyone.

Do you? I have to know.,No.
Okay.,"5 hours, 23 minutes, that's fast."
Is that good or bad?,"It depends. Either surgery went really well, or it ended really abruptly."

Tough being a doctor. You've got all that power. The power to play God.,"Yes, I don't envy the transplant committee their responsibility. They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl. I'm not sure I could have done that."

Who'd you kill?,"Nobody, but it's not Even lunch. Got served with a federal court order. Some witness went into a coma and they want me to take a look at it."
What? They want you to examine a sick person? This is a public relations nightmare. Don't think our staff do that kind of thing around here! this place would be crawling with sick people!,"I'm a doctor, I'm not a lapdog for the feds; I don't play fetch."
"You have three choices: hire a Lawyer to fight the order, treat the guy, or go to jail for contempt. Up to you.","Jail. You'd like that. No more naughty schoolgirl. Conjugal visit, that's her new fantasy."
We're not leaving until he's gone or you show me one good reason for keeping him.,"He's really out of it, huh?"
He had his stomach pumped! Why would they do that?,Rule out poisoning.
Huh. Not the typical first guess.,"No, the first guess was faking it. Patient's a federal witness, reluctant, I'm assuming. He's also an 8 on the Glasgow coma scale."
"Any recent history of head trauma? Bad car accident, fall?","They tell me no, but do an MRI to be sure."
"Metabolic causes. Liver, kidney, diabetes ""","Check for Everything, feds are paying. We're gonna turn a profit on this one, boys."
"Dr. House, Bill Arnello. I'm a Lawyer, I represent Mr. Smith. What's wrong with him?",Do I come to you with my pRoblems?
He's also my brother.,"What, you changed your name? ""Smith"" wasn't good enough for you?"
"His name's Joey, he's my only brother.","He's important to you, got it. So, no placebos for him, we'll use the real medicine. Well, this was fun, let's do it again soon. Brother in the Mafia? So, just Joey? I was hoping for a nickname. Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench. People know where I am."
"I want you to do your job. Diagnose him, fix him, and keep him here.",We're a bit of a specialized hospital. We generally only deal with Patients when they're actually sick.
"If you release my brother to the government, and he does what they want, Even if you fix him, he's dead. I need time to convince him of that. Good news is, if you screw up you don't have to worry about a malpractice suit. If he's dead, one by one, I'll take away the things you love 'till there's nothing left.","So, on the Mafia thing, that's a yes."
Bleeding around his brain caused pressure inside his head which caused the coma.,These look like pseudomembranes. Those take time to form. If it was an old injury it wouldn't have caused the coma.
"Subdural hematoma placed where this one is, it could have caused his coma.",What about his liver?
"I say we evacuate the cavity, see if he wakes up.","The neurologist thinks it's his brain, wants to open up his head. Frankly, I'm shocked! You get to use the big boy drill and Daddy's big red toolbox."
"He's okay now, he can leave.",I'm not releasing him.
Because the brother doesn't want you to?,"Or because he had an unexplained coma, which sounds better?"
The hematoma caused the coma.,"That's a catchy diagnosis, you could dance to that."
"I think Chase is right. It still should be evacuated, but it's not an immediate threat.",Cameron's my girl.
I'd release him.,"Are you disagreeing with me because """
I'm disagreeing because that's my medical opinion.,"Of course it is. But unless I've been named as the fourth part of the Axis of Evil, invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy. He's staying. Send for Hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel."
"Of course it is. But unless I've been named as the fourth part of the Axis of Evil, invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy. He's staying. Send for Hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel.","Hey. I'm with you. Old enough to drink, old enough to do something really stupid and make yourself a baby."
He's my brother. I'm watParkng him while my parents are in Barbados. He's having trouble breathing and there's a lot of wheezing.,"Whistling, technically. Upper airways, nose."
"If he's got the croup, that could become meningitis, right?",Absolutely.
I was just studying and all of a sudden I hear him crying and sounding all weird. My parents are going to kill me.,I doubt it.
You don't know them.,"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away. Hello, Officer. You might want to rinse this off before you let him play with it again."
"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away. Hello, Officer. You might want to rinse this off before you let him play with it again.",What happened? Where is he?
"Vogler called admitting, admitting called Justice, Justice came and took him away.",And who called Vogler?
D-D-D-D-Dr. House in the House! Impeccable timing as always.,You had no authority to release my Patient.
"Dr. House, from what I understand, your """,From what you understand? He's not your Patient; how the hell do you understand anything?
That's sad.,You're not Even a doctor.
John Smith is here only because of court order. I had the records faxed to the Judge; she rescinded the order.,"Why bother, just to piss me off?"
Keeping the government off our ass. Hmm. Yeah. That makes no sense for a public institution.,Okay.
Okay what?,"Okay, sir. Carry on."
"35-year-old male, vital signs are stable now. Gave him 2 liters en route. Just released from here two hours ago.","So, your junior G-Man badge isn't looking so good."
His liver's worse.,Comatose?
Serology tests came back positive for Hep-C.,Hep-C is a chronic condition. You don't think this is an acute situation?
"Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain, Hep-C explains Everything.",Except for the suddenness of the onset.
What's wrong with the timing?,"You get home one night. Your wife hits you with a baseball bat. Likely cause is the fact you haven't thanked her for dinner in eight years, or the receipt for fur handcuffs she found in your pants. Sudden onset equals proximate cause."
"He also has high estrogen lEvels in his blood. That's indicative of a chronic condition, not acute.",One test. What do his other liver tests tell us?
Uh-huh. And why is her test better than mine?,Because she's cuter. Though it's close. Do a liver biopsy. When the results come back we'll know what we're looking at.
"Why wait to treat the Hep-C? If I'm right, Joey gets better that much faster.","Right. Then he gets to testify, and you get a gold star from Cuddy."
Then what's the downside? Or is that the downside.,"Do I have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars? Fine, start the treatment. It's all your idea. Don't Even mention my name. There's nothing wrong with your theory, go. But in the ""humor me"" department, get a biopsy while you're at it. Foreman, we need to talk. You're off the case."
What? Why?,Somebody told Vogler that I lied to the transplant committee.
You think I did?,You're too careful. You wouldn't jump ship unless you knew what was in the water.
"Stop, you're embarrassing me.","But I want Vogler to think I think it's you. And I want Cameron and Chase and Cuddy and Wilson and the nursing staff and the cashier in the Parking lot to think that, too."
"Ah, this is all my fault.",Took another homework break with Betty Lou?
"No, last week I showed him a magic trick.",Pulled a quarter out of his nose. It's a classic.
Dr. House.,Got a crisis here!
Stop!,It's a neat trick.
You have to beliEve you'll actually hurt them.,Ah.
Your people insulted my brother.,"What, they put roMano in the parmesan cheese shaker again?"
Said he was a crackhead or a homo or something.,"Those idiots. How Many times am I going to have to send them through sensitivity training? Nobody's saying he's a homo, that would be really, really bad. So let's put a nice, friendly spin on it. Let's go with: he got raped in prison. I saw the jailHouse tats, put it together with the blood tests!"
"There were rumors, but Joey nEver said anything about!. If people find out he's being treated for Hep-C? Feds get that chart, someone says something to somebody, word'll get out. And then Joey's Manhood, his rep is destroyed.",You're worried about how his coworkers will react in the Walmart in Des Moines.
"He's not going into Witness Protection, I won't let that happen.","Listen, I don't know if you know about this, but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books."
"One legit, one not.",Exactly.
You jerking my chain?,"Doctors are busy, sometimes they forget to write things down, it happens all the time."
"Thanks. Oh, and whatEver you're not giving him for whatEver he doesn't have, is that going to fix him?",I doubt it.
I doubt it.,On your way to polish Vogler's car?
"Gone are the days of the grumpy old doc seeing Patients in the basement of his House, getting paid a few Parkckens.",How will I eat?
"You know what Cuddy has been locked in with Vogler about all day today, and yesterday?",Floor polish costs through the roof?
You. Her secretary's been to the photocopier all day with your records. It's all they're looking at in there.,My car has been stolen.
"Or rein-CAR-nated. Pink slip. ""A gift from the Arnello brothers.""","You know, they're gangsters, sure, but they're thoughtful, too."
You can't keep it. It's graft.,"No, no, no, no. Uh-uh. Graft is if I tell them I'll only make him better if he slips me a couple bucks. A payoff for something I'm not supposed to do. If I'd asked for the payoff , I would have done the bad thing anyway. So there's nothing wrong with this."
Right.,"Damn. '65. Perfectly restored. What do you think a guy like Joey would do if someone turned down a gift? That's kind of an insult, isn't it?"
He might hurt you. It's definitely possible.,I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.
Varices. You see it with chronic Hep-C all the time.,Biopsy's back. Two findings. Number one: lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.
"Well, whatEver's killing him is not Hep-C. It's acute.",Who said that? I forget. What are you doing here? I told you you were off the case.
"Right. Your diabolic plan to convince the evil genius he's in the clear so he'll let his guard down and make a fatal mistake, sure.","Well, it's clearly not going to work now."
What evil genius?,"If we knew that, then we wouldn't need a diabolic plan now, would we?"
"Oh, what? One of us?","No, you guys love me too much."
"All right, look, if it's not the Hep-C, then what's the pRoblem? What's causing the liver failure?",Finding number two: toxins.
"No. He's only 30 years old and his job doesn't expose him to heavy metals or environmental ""","He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him."
"He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him.","WhatEver this toxin is, it's doing its job and fast. How long do we have until the next round of test results?"
"What, in two hours?","There is another way. Relax, it's kosher."
"You absolutely do, and I absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it.",Anything?
"White blood count's low; pRobably a result of the illness, nothing to connect to the liver.",Is he a smoker?
Let me check.,Early signs of emphysema. He's been smoking at least a dozen years.
18. You got that from the white count?,"Nope, got that from the chest x-ray. White count just tells me he's quitting."
Where did you get the money.,"Cancel the thumb screws, I've got our culprit."
Who?,"Not who, Hu."
Huh?,"Thanks for playing along. Chai Hu, a Parknese herb in his quit smoking candy. Reduces cravings, also reduces his white blood count. Oh yeah, he also took enough of them to poison himself. We'll keep him on the pig for a few more hours, then take him off the candy, he'll be fine. Pig won't be. Oh no."
"So, the mobster's good to go?","I'll keep him overnight, then let the feds know he's good to rat out whoEver he wants."
Brother won't be happy.,Maybe have to give back the car.
You should let Vogler tell the feds.,Why?
"Because it matters to him. Because you humiliated him the first time Joey was released. You think you should still be in third there, ace?",He humiliated himself.
"And because your job depends on the kind of mood Vogler's in at the end of his marathon with Cuddy. Seriously, Man, have you Ever driven an automobile before? There are four gears, you know.",The '66 came with a Shut Up button.
The '66 came with a Shut Up button.,It is my medical opinion that the Patient is healthy and can be released.
I see you've found out what we're meeting about.,You're having a meeting?
"Well, whatEver the reason, the coat looks good on you. Chai Hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure, no way!","Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it's like gas to a flame."
What Interferon?,For the Hep-C.
What Hep-C?,Oops.
Is hiding a mobster's Hep-C that important?,Is letting the feds know Everything that important?
"You know, you are a piece of work, Even now.",Ed!
Edward.,Joey's back in a coma.
"Worse than before, he's on a ventilator.","Question is, why? It's not his brain, it's not a toxin. Our friend Babe helped with that one. So what else?"
"The Hep-C. We nEver really treated it, we stopped the Interferon when it started poisoning his liver.",Am I going to have to write a song about it? His chronic Hep-C was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.
The estrogen lEvel indiCates it is.,IndiCates something else entirely.
They're running a trial on dogs at St. Sebastian's in Philadelphia. I'll make the call.,What else could cause his estrogen lEvel to be that high?
"Maybe there's nothing up there, I watched him like a hawk.",Pretty sure you didn't.
I didn't let him play with any more little toys.,Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there. Stop or I snap your nose off!
He's not too smart.,"Genetics is a powerful force. On the other hand, maybe he's smarter than you think."
What's going on?,Just give me a second. Always wanted to use one of these. Tilt his head back.
I don't know.,"Just tilt his head back. Nice grasp of concepts, relationships. Very smart, very cool. First the policeMan, fireMan, fire truck. Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat."
Wow.,Sometimes the simplest answer!
Sometimes the simplest answer!,Most types of coma you just don't snap out of.
"He's not snapping out of this one, he's not improving. You crossed out estrogen, you've got an explanation?","Yes, I have. A very simple one."
And?,It's private.
You think I'm the one running to Vogler.,"You're currently top of the list. Toxic comas, person's away from the cause long enough and they recover."
"The feds checked for poisons, we checked for poisons. I didn't do it.","It's not a poison, then."
"An allergy, then. Did you hear me?",How about a food sensitivity?
"All of his food is strictly controlled. There's no correlation between his meals and his condition. He had steak and potatoes before the first coma, and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one. You can trust me.","PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help."
"PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.",So where did you get the money?
What?,Someone paid you off.
"What are you talking about? It wasn't poison, you told us that it """,You're talking about poison. I'm talking about payoff. Graft.
Leave him alone.,You paid the marshal off.
I didn't pay him to poison my brother.,"No, it just worked out that way."
I gave the guy some money to get him some decent food.,Better than fish sticks? I'm thinking steak.
"We asked for pasta. Those stupid feds could care less ""","He had steak before both comas. Your brother has Ornithine TranscarbAmylase Deficiency. You want me to write it down? Good, because it takes a while. It's genetic, it can present at any time. The Patient eats a large amount of protein, especially if he's not used to it."
That's it? He stays off the red meat and he's going to be fine?,"Yes. If I'm right, and we stop the current treatment, he gets better. If we stop the current treatment and I'm wrong, he dies."
Why would you be wrong?,"His estrogen lEvel. OTD doesn't explain his estrogen lEvel. But I have a theory. There is one chemical that, if ingested, can cause a person's estrogen lEvel to increase dramatically."
What is it?,It's called estrogen.
"Joey's taking estrogen? What, he wants a sex change?","No, nothing like that. It's called Male Flame. It's pRobably more consumer friendly in the original Parknese. It's an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men."
"Oh, here we go.","And sold on the same website that sells his Chai Hu lozenges. Guess what's in it? Starts with an ""e""."
"You want to get hit, too?","That would be quite a trick. ""He slapped me so hard his brother turned straight."" Joey's a big-time mobster. Guys like that don't get raped in prison. They get gifts, they get food, drugs, cigarettes, cable TV!"
Joey is not gay.,"Well, maybe not gay, but certainly delightful. You, on the other hand, hitting a doctor, Even if it was only Chase! and asking another one to keep his chart fresh and homo-free. Well, that's a bit of an overreaction, wouldn't you say? It's almost like you're scared that it might be true."
You're wrong.,"Okay. Then don't stop the treatment. But if you're wrong, he dies."
"Okay. He nEver said anything to me about it, not once.","That's what I love about you mob guys: so tolerant of others, so accepting. Only way he was coming out was way, way out. Lose the tattoos, change his name, move to another town! how's a guy like him going to do that? Witness protection. It's not just for witnesses any more."
Vogler wants to fire you. Lose the whole department.,"Good thing you fought for me, though, right? The dress was a nice move, but you've got to follow it up. Nasty weekend in Vegas, something that shows off your real administrative skills."
He threatened to fire me.,"I'm sorry. So, how long do I have? I've a lot of personal stuff to pack up. I assume you're going to want to throw a party."
"I told him I know where the bodies are buried, the stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. Told him he can't ditch me.","He's only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes. He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have the moves down. Then he won't need you any more."
I'll deal with that then.,So I stay.
Yes. But some things are going to change.,Profits. New world order.
Huh.,Everything's about profits.
"Yeah, that's real new. You could rent out the Corvette Every once in a while, or lend it to a friend.","That would be easy, and it would be wrong."
But Cuddy stood up for you.,To a point.
To what point?,I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them.
Why only two?,'Cause one of them's gone. I gotta fire somebody. Good morning.
"Only 10 more seconds, you got it. Jessica, Jessica! Jessica! Oh, my God! Hey, go to the office, get Miss Parsons. Now! I'm on a playground at Finley Elementary. One of my students is having a heart attack. Yeah, she's ten. Don't you think I know that? Just send the damn ambulance! Come on, wake up, sweetie.",You Ever see an infected pierced scrotum?
"Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.","Well, if pain's what you're after the penis is really the way to go. I'd recommend the apadravya."
We're not talking.,Oh? Sounded like we were.
"No, you're attempting to avoid talking because you know what I want to talk about.",Nipples?
You need to get rid of one of your people.,"Absolutely. As soon as I do perforMance reviews. And then review the reviews, of course. Because a decision like this can't be made without proper, you know, review. Shouldn't take longer than a month, maybe two. Four at the most, unless it gets compliCated."
"There's no way out on this. You may as well get it over with as fast as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.",Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it's a huMan being.
Like you care.,Like you don't.
We have a referral from Dr. Linkowitz.,Don't know him.
He knows you.,What's the pRoblem?
Heart attack.,Definitely don't know him.
Ten year olds do not have heart attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.,Right. The simplest explanation is she's a forty-year-old lying about her age. Maybe an actress trying to hang on.
That's because of her depression.,"That's what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said. The heart attack would seem to indiCate that they missed something."
"Syndrome X could cause a stroke, but I don't know about a heart attack.","Could, if her blood pressure was high enough."
"Which is likely, considering her weight.","It fits the symptoms. Me likee. Do a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Oh, and one more thing. I've been told that I've got to get rid of one of you guys by the end of the week. New sheriff, belt tightening, you know how it goes. Okay, carry on."
"It's really bad, especially at night. It's like my heart is on fire, like it's, uh, oh, I don't know, like it's!",Burning?
Exactly!,"Hmm, sounds almost like heartburn."
"So, can you give me something?",Like a thesaurus?
What?,I take it you nEver mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.
Prenatal? I'm not pregnant.,"Sorry, you don't get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules."
"I know when I'm pregnant, all right? I have six kids. That's why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms.","Vasectomies can rEverse themselves, condoms break."
"Okay. This is what a Woman is supposed to look like. Okay, we're not just skin and bones. We have flesh. We have curves.","You have little people inside you. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training."
Damn right.,Let's see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.
"Blood, why?","The heartburn, gotta make sure it's not spreading."
"So, any thoughts?",On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?
Who you're gonna let go.,I'm thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.
"Yeah, you should be able to pull that off. Most billionaires aren't very good with numbers.","It will be more cost-efficient once I've grabbed Cameron's ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase! well, I can grab his ass, too."
Separate or together?,Together.
"Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend.","You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically sincere. And they didn't screw it up."
Who are you?,"I'm from the lab. The blood tests showed your daughter wasn't hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis wasn't caused by anything these doctors did."
So then what was it caused by?,"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise."
"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?
Nothing that could also cause a heart attack.,I assume I don't have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.
Have you Ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind?,She hasn't had liposuction.
Thank you.,But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?
Like what?,Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.
Her tox screen was negative.,Wouldn't show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.
"Yeah, she thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.","She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, find those pills."
"She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, find those pills.","Not diet pills. You might want to broaden the search just a little. And don't just ask the mom, if she hasn't mentioned yet, she's not gonna """
"If you're gonna fire someone, go ahead and do it, but don't treat us like lab rats, testing how long it takes us to get us at one another's throats.",So what should I do?
I don't give a damn what you do.,"Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference. You don't Even offer a medical opinion any more. Who would you fire?"
Not my call.,"I want your opinion. Fine, it's you. Either way, you're making a choice."
Chase.,Wh- Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?
Anyone can make a mistake.,"Right, it's the money. You resent it, but you're going to tell me he doesn't need the job."
He doesn't appreciate the job.,He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.
"He wants the job. He just doesn't appreciate it. There's nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out, but this is not the place to do it.",I'm surprised.
You thought I'd pick Cameron?,I didn't think you'd pick at all.
I didn't think you'd pick at all.,"I guess he's not the ""rise above the fray"" guy he likes to think he is."
You practically forced it out of him.,"He's scared of losing his job, just like Everyone else."
"I've been thinking. You've made it quite clear that you're miserable here """,I am not miserable.
You're not happy.,And you are?
"With! my job, yes.",I am exactly where I want to be doing exactly what I want to do.
I think I sense a hint of sarcasm there. Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?,Hmmm! I was wrong.
About Vogler or Foreman?,Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy tests.
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?,Either a Woman carrying an alien baby or your newest Patient.
"Oh, God.",It's actually a personal record for this clinic.
I'll have a huge scar! I won't be able to wear a bikini!,You wear a bikini now?
"Yeah, you got a pRoblem with that?","Nope, but I've nEver gone swimming with you."
I knew it. That's what this is all about! You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery!,"Yeah, that's exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary."
That was unexpected.,"Yeah, it was."
I can't beliEve she was that desperate.,"Yeah, I'm sure that if Everyone I knew hated me, I couldn't bear to look at me. I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift."
Right.,Wait! Are you going to let him say that? He insulted our basketball teams!
Or not.,"Or both. Diet pills brought her to us, we gave her the sores."
You think she got a staph infection from something here?,"I'm not saying the hospital gave the sores, I'm saying we did. By treating her. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis."
Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.,Who gave her the heparin?
"I gave warfarin, she gave heparin.",Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?
"Yes, I did not screw up.",Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin? Enough said.
"Yeah, right. There's gotta be some other cause.",None that I can think of. Let's fix the mistake. Give her unfractionated IV heparin and low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection stat.
Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.,Hey! Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the Patient's.
Wanted to know what warfarin is. I don't know.,Brrrr. Icy. Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.
"Correct all you want. Of course, it's a bit more productive if there's an actual mistake.","Right, I always forget that part."
"I gave her the heparin, which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin, which is pRobably why she's not responding to your treatment.","Yet. If you didn't screw up, then what is it? You don't have an answer."
Yet.,"When you come up with something, let me know. I'll be in the clinic, warming up."
I'm the only one who's always stood behind you when you've screwed up.,Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?
"Because I'm not insanely insecure. And because I can actually trust in another huMan being and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.","I'm sorry, you said you weren't angry. Who would you fire?"
No one.,Not an option.
If Everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.,"Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The pRoblem is, the world doesn't work that way just 'cause you want it to."
"Excuse me, Dr. House? My wife saw you yesterday, Lucille Hernandez?","Uh, he's not in today."
My wife said he walked with a cane.,He's also got a bit of a drug pRoblem. Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks.
He's not gonna fire anybody.,"Yes. I'm going to cut the pay of all four of us. 17% across the board will allow you to keep us all for the same amount of money. I beliEve it's what you suits call ""win-win""."
"If he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?",It's not about the money.
What's going on with my wife?,"Even if I was Dr. House, physician-Patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations."
But she told me about the tumor.,Yeah? She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?
I don't care about a scar. And she can always gain the weight back.,You want her to regain the weight?
"Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.",Why?
"I've always thought she's looked sexiest when she was pregnant. Something 'bout knowing she's a mother makes me want to ""","Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone."
"I did. You gotta talk to her, I couldn't bear it if something happened to her ""","The tumor is benign, nothing's gonna happen. Except maybe some more heartburn."
What if it gets Even bigger? Or if it changes?,You know where to find us. Building's not going anywhere.
Tell her it's cancer. You obviously don't have a pRoblem with lying.,"Oh, way to win me over."
We have six kids. She can't afford to take a chance.,"You have kids! How novel! That changes Everything. So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire."
"Please, I don't know what we'd do.",They are cute. Have her come back in.
What?,Your plight has moved me. Tell your wife to come back.
Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.,Have you found the right thing?
No.,Then we continue the treatment. Hope it's just taking longer than it should.
At this point it doesn't matter what caused the necrosis.,Or who.
Get rid of it. Remove the dying flesh before it penetrates the abdominal wall.,Do it.
Can we talk?,"What, no roses, no chocolates? If you're here to apologize """
I'm not here to apologize.,"Uh-oh, that means you're here for something more compliCated."
Do you want to fire me?,Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse. Thank God Vogler came along. Phew!
It's the only reason I can think of that you're insisting that I made a mistake.,"Really? Because there is another explanation. Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis, but maybe you actually made a mistake."
You're doing this because you can't deal with your feelings for me.,"I beliEve that you are the only one to express feelings. And if we're going to look at this from a first-year psych point-of-view, maybe you want me to fire you. Maybe that's why you're acting weird. You """
"You're the one being different! You're always pushing things, pushing the rules, pushing us, but not this time. You just jumped on this idea like a life raft. Not one question about what else it could be, no riding us for other answers.",I have the answer.
"Then why aren't you watParkng TV? Or playing your damn Game Boy, or whatEver else you have fun doing by yourself? Maybe I should just quit. Make it easy for Everyone.",Maybe you should.
Maybe you should.,Men are pigs.
"You call me in to tell me ""","I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious. Cute kids. Love her green eyes. And his baby blues. Of course, since you and your husband have brown eyes!"
Where'd you get that?,"From the father of three, maximum four of your six Parkldren. So I'm thinking maybe the reason you don't want surgery is, while your husband may find you attractive no matter what, all the other men you're sleeping with might not be so open-minded. Which brings me back to my original thesis: men are pigs. You got nothing to worry about. You know, pretty much have sex with anyone, fat, skinny, married, single, complete strangers, relatives """
You? You're sick.,So are you. I'm sure there are websites full of men looking for married women with surgical scars. So have the surgery. Please?
Foreman Ever said anything about talking to me? Interesting.,"It's been almost three hours, still no change in her condition."
So what do you want to do?,Assume that Cameron didn't screw up. What if it's not the warfarin?
"It has to be. The sores presented right after we ""","Right, right, right, but let's just say it's not. Come on, come on, what have you got?"
Can I have a second to think?,"No, there's no time to think! Say the first thing that comes to you head."
That's not what I meant.,We already considered obesity as a cause.
"No, what if it's not a cause? What if it's a symptom?","Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis? Listen, I don't care if it makes sense, just give me something."
Ulcers secondary to vaculitis.,"No, that's just sores, not obesity."
Pyoderma gangrenosum?,"More sores. Okay, let's look at it from the other side. What has obesity as a symptom?"
"Genetics are more likely. Her mom's heavy, too.",She's not just heavy. She's tall. We have any history on the dad?
"Yeah. 6'1"".","Kid's short. We've got stunted growth, high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity "" it's Cushing's."
"No, necrosis doesn't present in ""","In rare cases Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin. It's perfect. It explains Everyting."
Except it's not Cushing's. She's had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol lEvels.,"The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn't catch it in the right phase."
We'll have to do another UFC.,There's no time! We've got less than an hour to make the call.
"If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll lose her breasts and may still be sick.",Do an MRI.
You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an MRI?,"No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI."
It's been a week.,"Actually, it's over a week. Where have you guys been?"
Who is it?,Chase.
"No, Chase stays. Pick someone else.","The deal was """
Deal's changed. Pick someone else.,No.
"The Senator's suffering from nausea, headache, and mental confusion.","Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose."
"You're being Parkldish. Look, if his case is as trivial as you think it'll take you three minutes to diagnose him.","Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages."
You're mad at me.,Nope. I nEver liked Cameron or Foreman.
"Do you know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player. Now, if you did that, you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.",Fine. I'll hold the Senator's hair while he upchucks.
"Oh, and by the way, I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference. Next week.",I don't do speeches. I'm shy.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has dEveloped a new ACE inhibitor. I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.,"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals! wait a second, don't I own that company? Oh, no, that's right, you do."
Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version. All there in the study.,I know its price tag is significantly improved.
You can either give one ten minute talk and one three minute diagnosis or you can fire one of your pets. My understanding was that you beliEved in rationality above all else.,Viopril!
"I don't think so. And I don't think that's it, I've been under the weather for weeks, you know. Lots of traveling, supposed to be in the Sudan next week.",Helps me concentrate. Even better than drugs.
"When I was six, I fell off the swings and bit my tongue. Couldn't talk right for the longest time. Lots of teasing. But, you know, it just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can't.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top."
"You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?",I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.
You find sincerity annoying.,"You're a black kid from the ghetto who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate. That's a sufficiently mythical story, you don't need to lie about your tongue. Must have missed it."
What's wrong? What is it?,It's not the food. It's your brain. Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture. Cancel your travel plans.
The LP showed no sign of infection and the MRI was fairly clean.,I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.
Most likely just background nose.,Care to bet your job on that? What was that?
What was what?,You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.
I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.,"But last week you didn't get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It's weird, it's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about."
Chase has nothing to worry about?,None of you has anything to worry about.
What happened?,Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented. The lesion could be nothing. It could also be a brain tumor or infection. There's only one way to find out which.
You wanna cut into his brain.,"Dangerous, I know. Especially as he's a politician, his brain's all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled."
"Dangerous, I know. Especially as he's a politician, his brain's all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled.",You're not pregnant.
"Well, I told you that. But there's gotta be some other reason I'm still spotting.","Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone lEvels, you had a miscarriage."
I haven't Even been on a date.,"Right, since it's physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner."
I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband. That was almost a year ago.,"Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception."
"Um, what do I do?","Well, it's obvious. Start a religion. [He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him."
In my office.,Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood.
You're not doing a brain biopsy on a spot on a MRI.,Where'd you get that?
Not on an United States Senator.,"Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?"
A brain biopsy can cause perManent neurological damage.,"Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make 'em grow big and strong. It's my call."
"No, it's not.",You're pulling rank on Patient care?
It's up to you.,"Either it's a tumor or it's an infection that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up. Either way, if we don't treat it immediately, it could kill you."
W-what caused my s-symptoms?,"Wow, excellent question. Many doctors wouldn't have gone there."
It could be a transient ischemic attack. You could make the argument for watParkng carefully for the time being.,"Mmm, but you'd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass."
"That's absurd, and insulting.","Insulting, yes."
W-what will the voters think? If they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?,"This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you're worried about NASCAR dads?"
It's not a brain tumor.,"It's not a bacterial infection, either."
So you biopsied his brain for nothing.,"If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?"
You sure?,Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS. They're gonna love that in Dubuque.
"Theoretically, certain cancers ""","If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS."
"I do not have AIDS. I don't sh-sh-shoot up drugs, I don't sl-sleep with!","This is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize. But we've gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast."
We will.,"But the toxo drugs are going to piss off your fungi, and when fungi get pissed """
I am not gonna take the pills.,"You're afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you're not going to become President either way. They don't call it the White House because of the paint job."
House nEver gives speeches.,"But when I really beliEve in something! Gosh dang it, I've got a chance to make a difference here."
You made a deal with Vogler?,It's all the rage. Everybody's doing it.
"So, what's the deal? You get to keep all of us if you plug his products?","One speech, no biggie. Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer."
Cancer? The Senator's got AIDS.,Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELisatest for HIV.
Thank you. For the speech.,"When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat's the word you doctors use, right?"
"I know it's hard for you """,Double stat?
"Dr. House. I just wanted to ""","You're welcome, again."
"I want you to know how much I """,Got it. You're grateful. Apparently you seem to think it'll mean a lot to me to know that.
Do you know why people beliEve in God?,I thought you didn't beliEve in God.
I don't.,"Well, then you better be making a very good point."
Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.,"Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that's great, but just so you know, I've nEver made a tree."
I thank you because it means something to me. To be grateful for what I receive.,You are the most naÃ¯ve atheist I've Ever met.
"Dr. House, you have a Patient in Room One.",Thank God. People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs. I'm not gonna crush you.
PeteParkal bruising? I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.,"Gosh, the internet is such a wonderful tool."
It could be leukemia.,Definitely possible. The more likely diagnosis is hickey.
"Well, it can't be a hickey.",Why is Everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?
I'm not having sex. I've barely Even thought about sex since my marriage. Ow!,"I say you're having sex, you say you're not. Either you're lying, or I'm wrong. Or there's some middle ground."
You mean like oral?,"I mean you're having sex without knowing it. I'm testing you for booze, drugs and GHB."
"I don't drink, and! what's GHB?",The date rape drug.
The date rape drug.,"It's positive. Your T-cell count is eight, which means there's a good chance you'll die. I'm telling you this because we need to contact your sexual partners."
"I've only had two girlfriends. Two, after my wife died. I used c-c-condoms.",You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?
Yes.,"Some day there will be a black president. Some day there will be a gay president. Maybe there will Even be a gay, black president. But one combination I do not see happening is gay, black, and dead. You need to stop lying to me."
"It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.","Oh, cut the crap, you're dying."
"You're clEver, you're witty, and you are a coward! You're scared of taking chances.","I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities."
On people?,Wanting to beliEve the best about people doesn't make it true.
Being afraid to beliEve it doesn't make it false.,"Well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote."
"This is who I am. I beliEve in people. I'm not hiply cynical and I don't make easy, snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again.",I need to draw some more blood.
The antiretrovirals aren't working.,That's not surprising.
"He's just going to keep getting worse. You realize that, right?",Why are you spying on my case?
Why are you giving that speech next week? We're both just doing what we have to do.,And you don't see a pRoblem with that?
"Checking in on a Patient? Yeah, wow, how do I look myself in the mirror?",You're not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.
It's a ten minute speech!,That I've been ordered to give.
Vogler's drug works!,Don't care.
"Oh, why do you have to make Everything so dramatic?","Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff!"
"Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff!",Nuh uh. No pills.
What's going on?!?,The antiretrovirals aren't working.
Why not?,Because you don't have AIDS. The first test was a false positive. Happens one time in Every five thousand.
You r-ran a second test.,Yeah. You're still dying. The only difference is now we don't know why.
Why are we doing this here?,"So Cuddy can't find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy's lied to his last constituent."
False negative on the PCR AIDS test?,Ran it twice.
Immunoglobulin deficiency?,No history of respiratory pRoblems.
Idiopathic T-cell deficiency.,"Idiopathic, from the Latin meaning we're idiots 'cause we can't figure out what's causing it. Give him a whole body scan."
You hate whole body scans.,"'Cause they're useless. Could pRobably scan Everyone of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer. But, when you're 4th-down, 100 to go, in the snow, you don't call a running play up the middle. Unless you're the Jets."
Why did you order the second AIDS test?,Standard procedure.
"Oh, well, that's you. Mr. Standard Procedure. You suspected the first test was a false positive?",I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.
"Yeah, but you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed?",I should have ordered both.
"You were sure he had AIDS, then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What, what did he say?",He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.
Huh. And you beliEved him.,"Well, he didn't have any reason to lie """
"Everybody lies, except politicians? House, I do beliEve you're a roMantic. You didn't just beliEve him, you beliEved in him. Do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry? Dr. Cameron's getting to you. Well, I guess you can't be around that much niceness and not get any on you.",Is that why you haven't put the moves on her?
"What makes you think I haven't put the moves on her? Oh. Oh, boy! You're in trouble.",You have restored my faith in the huMan race. You're lying.
"No, I'm not lying.","I just got your results back. No GHB, no nothing. It means you're having sex, and you're lying about it."
"No, and I have a new symptom. I have a rash on my butt. Do you want to! What is it?",It's a carpet burn.
"No, I just wake up really exhausted.",Is something upsetting you?
"No. My ex lives in the apartment downstairs. He's always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals. Get out of my life, how much clearer can you get?","We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it'll get you away from your ex for a night."
Slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit.,How slightly?
Lymphoma?,"Sure, or he's had a cold in the last six months. What, you've got her on speed dial?"
Looks complex. Central necrosis?,"Spontaneous bleeding, it's benign. I was rooting for a really cool tumor, instead we're stuck with this crap."
"Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em, you've gotta check 'em.","Well, knock yourselves out."
"I just saw Senator Wright, he looks like hell. That sushi must have been a lot worse than you thought.","Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A Man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year."
Here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.,Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.
Throw in a joke.,Dr. Chase. We need to talk.
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.,How do you see this ending?
What ending?,"I can't fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me. You told Cuddy where I was. You told Vogler what I was doing."
Yeah.,So how can I work with you?
I hope so.,I am selling my soul.
Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.,"I said I was selling it. I didn't say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they've done is added antacid."
Does it work?,That's not the point!
"Well, of course it's the point! He's not asking you to lie, he's not asking you to do something illegal """,He's not asking me to do anything.
"Kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and lymph nodes all came back clean.",His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.
"Well, not enough to indiCate lymphoma.",We nEver tested for hairy-cell leukemia.
And his spleen isn't enlarged.,Size isn't Everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let's cut it open.
"In the Senator's condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!","Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can't tell the Judge I had no idea of the risks involved."
"His brain's turning into mush, and he's at risk for more infections, so we have to do it.","See, that'll sound much better in court. Okay, go tell our huMan pincushion we'll be sticking him one more time. Cuddy. Don't you hate doing this?"
What's up?,You like me. Why?
That's kind of a sad question.,Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.
I don't think that's why you're asking. I think it's because of the speech.,"Oh God, don't try and pick me apart."
"No, his bone marrow's indeterminate, spleen's the only way to go.","You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish."
"Why, Dr. House?","They look for the blue heron, because there's no way to see the fish. But if there's fish, there's gonna be birds fishing. Now, if he's got hairy-cell, what else are we gonna see circling overhead?"
HTLV and ATLV.,We can test for them. Run the titers.
We can test for them. Run the titers.,"These were your brain waves at 2:45 AM. Now, here it comes, there's an abrupt jump from slow-wave sleep. This indiCates partial sleep arousal. The most common type is somnambulism "" sleepwalking."
That would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.,"Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn."
I had sex in my sleep?,"Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs """
I'll kill him.,"Okay, but he pRobably didn't know that you were asleep. Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose antidepressant. It'll let you sleep better. If you want to save yourself the $15 co-pay, you can have sex while you're awake."
"He's my ex, I ""","You live in the same building, you haven't had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I'm sensing unresolved issues."
Negative for HTLV-1 and 2 and ATLV and Everything else. It's not hairy-cell. Hey. You really gonna give that speech?,"You've got an opinion, too?"
"I'm a little surprised. Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.",You're welcome. He's positive for Epstein-Barr.
Hey!,You didn't fall off the swings when you were eight.
Six!,Ever.
Give that back!,Uh uh. We have to talk. You had an epileptic seizure. That's how you bit your tongue.
"I haven't had a seizure since I was """,What medication did you take?
No seizure since I was six. No drugs since I was ten!,"Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about what the question is, don't worry that you're starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message."
"My mother used to call it physofin """,Phenytoin?
"Yeah! Okay, okay, you're okay, it's okay. Everybody lies.","Senator Gary H. Wright of New Jersey had Parkldhood epilepsy. He took phenytoin. That drug, with the Epstein-Barr virus, is associated with common variable immunodeficiency disease. T-cells down, B-cells down, it keeps you from forming enough antibodies. See, antibodies are basically your defensive line. And your brain is like the quarterback. And then the fungi are like blitzing linebackers, plunging up the middle. Your lungs are like! okay, you've got two quarterbacks """
CVID? That's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.,"Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory pRoblem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr."
That's pretty much a Parkldhood disease.,"Another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic. He got it when he was a kid. Didn't get any symptoms until now, it happens. It gets triggered by stress, like public speaking."
So you're basing your diagnosis on a disease that's relatively common and a drug he took thirty years ago.,"Start the senator on IV immunoglobulin stat. If he gets better, I'm right, if he dies, you're right."
Dr. House!,You faked that.
No.,"Say ""antiretroviral""."
Antiretroviral.,Now say it three times fast.
Am I well enough to run for president?,"Well, why not run for pope while you're at it?"
"Oh, come on. Kennedy had Addison's, FDR had polio. Two of the best presidents in the last hundred years """,If they were running today they wouldn't stand a chance.
"So, you figure you'd be Surgeon General if you didn't have the limp.","No, there's things I can't do, and like you said, I have to live with reality."
"No, don't get excited, he's right, I, uh, I won't win.",Then why run?
"But hey, why listen to me? I own the company, I'm certainly not to be trusted, right? Dr. Gregg House, on the other hand, has a reputation. For integrity, among other things. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gregg House.","Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary commitment to research excellence is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease."
That's not a speech.,"I thought it was pithy. You got enough for a press release, anyhow."
Foreman or Cameron?,"A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessMan. A brilliant Judge of people, and a Man who has nEver lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it's just more expensive. A lot more expensive. See, that's another example of Ed's brilliance. WhenEver one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for Everbody, right? The Patients, pish. Who cares, they're just so damn sick! God obviously nEver liked them anyway. All the healthy people in the room, let's have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler! I threw in a joke."

I should have taken a couple of extra Vicodin and just held my nose.
I'm guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin.,True.
You don't need to worry about firing anyone. I'm leaving.,"Why? Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture? You trying to protect Foreman?"
No.,"So this is just, ""Don't fire me, I quit."""
Heh. Look for a shallow grave with Vogler standing over it.,You have a Stage 4 cancer. It's metastasized to your liver. There's a new drug called 8C 12 that's shown promise in Phase 2 trials. It's your best shot.
"Thank you, Doctor. You've been so good to me.","Well, I did publicly bash your company's drug."
When I think about how I treated you!,"Oh, hey, come on. There, there, there."
"So, um, there is some hope?","Always. But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin."
Hey!,Don't thank me. It's just who I am.
"Up and at 'em, big guy.","Sorry, up late. Internet porn."
How come you're not in your office?,"Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on, roMance will ensue. My wrist might fall off."
Hiding because Vogler's looking for you. That's just pathetic.,"I don't like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence. How is that pathetic?"
You think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here? He'll find you sooner or later.,I'm okay with later.
"39-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant, G 4, P 0.",Three miscarriages? Gimme.
Altered mental status and complete loss of coordination.,Tox screen?
Negative for alcohol and drugs. She was on oxybutynin.,For incontinence.
The three miscarriages make me think it's an underlying physiology.,"Pregnancy-related autoimmunity. Too bad that Cameron quit, I could use an immunologist right now. We'll see if you're right; check the blood."
Cameron quit?,"Last night. And do an MRA for vasculitis, too."
There is no way she quit! She got fired because you couldn't swallow your pride!,"An ultrasound? Excellent thought! And put her on magnesium, too, in case it is preeclampsia."
"She gets sick a lot but this, this cold got really bad all of a sudden. And the fEver! Shhhh, it's okay.",It's not a cold. It's pneumonia.
Pneumonia?,"Relax, pneumonia's her second-biggest pRoblem. She has gone from the twenty-fifth weight percentile to the third in one month. Now, I'm not a baby expert but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to shrink."
"But it's healthy, raw food. We're vegans. Almond milk, tofu, vegetables!","Raw food. If only her ancestors had mastered the secret of fire. Babies need fat, proteins, calories. Less important: sprouts and hemp. Starving babies is bad, and illegal in Many cultures. I'm having her admitted."
Is she gonna be all right?,"Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up. Don't worry, it's a vegan IV."
Okay.,"Whoa! There you are, I've been looking Everywhere for you. Uh, listen, you said I had to cut one of my people if I didn't give that speech about your drug, and in fairness to your point of view, my speech really wasn't the one you had in mind, so I've cut Cameron. Now we're all squared away, right?"
"In the morning, I expect you in my office with your letter of resignation and plans for a public apology, otherwise I'll destroy you.",So that's a 'no' on us being squared away.
Great to see you back in the office. I guess Vogler found you?,"Yeah, we had a nice little chat. I really should have kept Cameron. She knew where to find the sugar."
"It's what I said. Preeclampsia. A little stress from the MRA, she pops straight into labor.",Ah ha!
"She choked, she couldn't Even swallow.",What did she choke on?
Her food. The muscle weakness isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.,What kind of food?
"A little bit of cooked pear, it doesn't matter! It shows weakness.","She choked on soft, wet pear. Did she forget to take the bones out? That's way past muscle weakness. Did you do an upper endoscopy?"
We've gotta talk.,Oooh. We've gotta talk. And check her eyelids.
"Special board meeting today, only one item on the agenda: you.","Well, enjoy the bagels. I'm untouchable."
Huh. Right.,Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous. I've got you and maybe Even Cuddy.
"Oh, well that settles it. Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider will be stymied, go home, curl up on the floor of his shower and weep.",What can he do? I've got a contract.
Does it say how much your team gets paid? Where your Parking space is? If your car should be filled with horse Manure? Vogler's smart; he's got some plan to get you.,Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates.
Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates.,She's doing better.
"Oh, thank God.","Technically, Alexander Fleming. He dEveloped antibiotics. Pneumonia's under control, and from now on, what say you stick with huMan food."
"Absolutely, swear to God.","This time, that's your guy."
"Starving your kid. I'm from Social Services, we're taking responsibility for your baby.",This is how Vogler's gonna destroy me?
"What did he do, grease your cane?",He had my Patients arrested.
"He didn't, I did. The nurses were concerned and they called me. There was evidence of abuse; you took a big legal risk by not calling Social Services.","Those parents were not abusive, they're idiots."
"Oh, well that's certainly a relief.",It was my call.
You made the wrong one.,"You know, there's a new biography of Quisling, I think you might like it."
Sure. No idea who that is.,"Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor. The fact that I have to explain this kind of takes the edge off my flow."
I was protecting you.,From what? Cops aren't gonna bust me. Disiplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.
And Vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.,"If I don't give him one, he makes one up."
Maybe it's a granuloma.,No. There's no calcification.
Naomi is refusing to have the C-section. Her odds aren't good enough.,They do suck. Where's Wilson?
She's saving her Parkld. Cameron would point out that people are capable of sacrifice.,Cameron isn't here.
Perhaps proving her point.,You think this Woman is making a rational decision?
I think people can overcome their baser drives.,"Pretty damn rarely. And not this time, this is purely biological. In evolutionary terms, the needs of the next generation are more important."
You're saying she's making the right call?,"Darwin is, I'm not. The next generation is not my Patient. We have to raise the odds for Mommy. And where the hell is Wilson? He's the oncologist."
There he is. Dr. House!,You guys bust out?
We made bail. They won't let us in our baby's room.,Weird. You'd think they'd let you take her home while they figured out if you tried to kill her.
The nutritionist said it had Everything she needed!,The kid who stacks the free-range grapefruit in your health food store is not a nutritionist.
But my uncle is. He went to college and Everything.,"Foreman, I need a CT scan on!"
Olive Kaplan.,Seriously? Olive Kaplan. Check for abscesses or occult infections. Bu-bye.
Seriously? Olive Kaplan. Check for abscesses or occult infections. Bu-bye.,"Listen, Vogler's all about clinical trials, the hospital's chock full of them. There's got to be something for small-cell lung cancer. What are you doing?"
I got sacked.,"Did you make a pass at Cuddy? Told you, she only has thighs for me."
I voted to keep you.,So he's getting rid of Every board member who votes to keep me around?
"Yeah, Every one of us.",Just you?
Yeah.,"But you're only off the board, right? They couldn't have got unanimous approval for you."
"Brown from Oncology voted no, so did Cuddy, Taylor and PeEvey.","Eh, so you're off the board, big deal. Frees up Wednesday nights for bowling. You're still a doctor """
"Yeah, getting dumped looks great in Who's Who. Vogler gave me the option of resigning, and I took it.",Big of him.
"I've got no kids, my marriage sucks; I've only got two things that work for me: this job and this stupid, screwed-up friendship, and neither mattered enough to you to give one lousy speech.","They mattered. If I could do it all again """
"You'd do the same thing. Well, you'll be gone soon, too.",Those clinical trials?
I'll make some calls.,Thanks.
Looks worse than it is.,Nice job of protecting me.
Can this wait?,His ass can wait. You saved my job by sacking Wilson?
"What did you think would happen when you made that speech? You think he would just pout for a little while and we'd all forgive you? You don't spit on the Man who signs your paycheck. First Cameron, then Wilson "" you're next. Pull your pants up.",So it's about the money.
"Of course it's about the money. The money Vogler gave, he could have bought a few jets, maybe a baseball team, or just stuck it in Chase Manhattan and collected interest. But he gave it to us to buy equipment, to do research! You are a great doctor, House, but you are not worth $100 million.",We've sequenced the DNA of the tumor cells. P53 gene mutation at codon 55. She's perfect for your trial.
She's pretty far advanced.,"Well, you want easy cases, you picked the wrong speciality."
Otherwise in good health?,Excellent.
When can she start?,Middle of next week.
"Cancer's already stage 3, it'd be a waste of time.",She can start in two days.
She can't start in two days! She's pregnant!,She won't be in two days. I've scheduled a C-section.
She'd still have to wait a month. You can't take part in an trials until 30 days after major sugery.,"Well, it's definitely surgery, but major?"
It's not your call.,"Again, a question of interpretation."
"You're scamming a doctor, now? Come on, Vogler's looking for any excuse to can you.","Oh, I think he's got a big bag of those already."
"These regulations aren't just here to annoy you, okay? Doing this is dangerous to the Patient.","Well, I'll be sure to let her know that. Care to join me?"
"Well, I'll be sure to let her know that. Care to join me?","Angiogenesis inhibitors prEvent the tumors from creating blood vessels. Without blood, the tumor starves."
What about the baby?,"The treatment would be fatal to the baby. I've scheduled a C-section for later this afternoon. It's in the trial phase right now, but so far complete remission in more than thirty percent of subjects."
I told Dr. Foreman I didn't want a C-section.,When your chances of living were less than a third of what they are now.
"Well, the baby's premature, that """,Our pediatrics department has the best neonatal ICU in the state.
His odds are much better than yours are. You have to let them at least try this. Talk to her.,Okay. Leave the room. How long have you been taking oxybutynin?
"Uh, since I was about twenty.",Incontinence is pretty uncommon in a Woman of your age. It's Even more bizarre in a Woman in her twenties.
I guess I haven't had the best luck when it comes to my health.,"Seems that way. You said to your husband, ""You don't know what it's like, raising a sick Parkld."" You didn't say, ""You don't know what it would be like."" This is not your first Parkld, is it? And he doesn't know."
"I was eighteen. Got pregnant, got married. I had the most beautiful little girl, Grace. She had infantile Alexander's disease.",I'm sorry.
"For two years we watched her die. My husband was, uh, my first husband was a, a great guy, but after that I couldn't Even look at him without thinking of her. I left him, I left my job, I left Everything """,Very moving story. Explains why you're being so selfish.
I'm willing to die to protect my husband.,Because it's what you want. Your husband wants you to live.
"Well, he doesn't understand!","Oh, who the hell does? TragEdies happen. You think that turning yourself into a disposable incubator for a few weeks is going to protect your baby from all the crap in this world, go ahead, die happy. I got no pRoblems with people killing themselves, but don't think it makes you a hero."
Okay.,You're scheduled for 4 P.M.
Wake her up. That was Vogler; surgery's off.,HEY! You're killing her!
"Really? See, I thought you were the one trying to ram her into a drug trial five minutes after surgery ""","She knows the risks, she was fully informed """
"Well, the guy running the study sure wasn't.","Not his life, not his call!"
"His study, his call!","Right, so she kicks off, his number look bad."
"The numbers look bad, the study looks bad!",Which would cost you money!
And keep a life-saving protocol off the market!,"One person, one blip in the data!"
You Ever heard of the FDA? They eat blips for breakfast! One person should nEver endanger thousands!,"Well, thank God you were here to save all those lives!"
"Systolic BP's 80. BP's stabilizing, O2 stats rising.",Did you get the clot?
I think so. She's stabilized.,How long was her oxygen at that lEvel?
Ten minutes?,Brain function compromised?
Is she septic?,She's bleeding into her abdomen.
We won't be able to stop it. I'll go talk to the husband.,"No, you stay here. Keep her as stable as you can for as long as you can. She had trauma during the procedure. She's bleeding into her abdomen. There's nothing we can do; I'm sorry."
"Um, no.",I need you to okay the C-section.
"Yeah, that's gonna kill her, right?",It pRobably will.
I can't do that.,She's dying either way.
"I'm sorry, I'm ""","Stay with me, Sean. I need your okay on this."
"She makes the decisions, and I'm ""","Right, and that's gonna be tough from now on, but this decision is easy. You know what she'd want."
I can't do it.,"You make this call, only two things change. One: yeah, you feel guilty for killing your wife. Two: your baby lives. Naomi's baby lives."
Thank you. I'm late for the board meeting.,We need to talk.
I don't want to hear it.,It's about a Patient.
"The pregnant Woman? She wasn't qualified for that trial and I'm not going to apologize ""","I'm not talking about her. At this point I think it's best that I concentrate on Patients who are still alive. Pulmonary embolism. She bled out. Saved her son. This is Olive Kaplan's CT scan, the incredible shrinking baby."
"Her thymus gland ""","DiGeorge Syndrome. It's genetic, can cause the gland to wither to nothing."
This is why she couldn't gain weight.,Yeah.
I'll call the police and Social Services and have all the charges withdrawn.,I've sent a test down to confirm; when it comes back you should start Olive on immunoglobulin replacement.
You're not going to do it?,I assume I won't be here.
"If you think House deserves to go, if you think I deserve to go, Wilson deserved to go, then vote yes. But if you're doing this because you are afraid of losing his money, then he's right! He does own you. You have a choice. Maybe the last real one you'll have here.","Cuddy is a genius, convincing four people to give up a fortune to save our sorry asses. Dr. Cuddy! The Man of the hour."
What are you doing?,We're drinking. I would have thought that was pretty obvious.
"Well, to the great champion. Saved you, saved Wilson, saved the whole team. Of course, none of them would have needed saving if you could actually get along with another huMan being.","Well, thank you, Miss Buzzkill."
"Well, you only cost us $100 million. Could have saved some lives, could have made a few jobs, helped a few people. Yippee.",You voted to get rid of him.
Call 911. We need an ambulance!,I saw the light on.
It's daytime.,"Yeah, it's a figure of speech. Always so literal."
Got a new cane.,Yeah. Guy in the store said it was slimming. Vertical stripe!
Why are you here?,Vogler is dead.
What? What happened?,"Again with the literal translation. Vogler the idea, Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags, bow down before me; he is gone from the hospital, so things can go back to the way they were."
The way they were was kind of weird.,Weird works for me.
What are you saying? Literally?,I want you to come back.
Why?,"Please unclench. You're not on the clock, and when you do that, I clench, and then it's the whole thing!"
Could you look at your pager?,"It's no big deal, some sort of epidemic. Not my area."
"You should go, it's important.",What I'm doing now is important.
Why do you want me back?,Because you're a good doctor.
That's it?,That's not enough?
Dr. House! We need you here.,"Sorry, lot of sick people. I might catch something."
"A Judge at the campus pool center collapsed, LP rEvealed a virulent form of bacterial meningitis.","Great, got it diagnosed, you don't need me."
2500 people at the pool center were exposed. They're being bused to all the neighboring hospitals.,"That's a pRoblem of resources, not diagnostics. No, I'd be completely lost, get in Everyone's way."
Joe! Dr. House doesn't have a blue slip. No one leaves the quarantine area without a blue slip. You are a doctor at this hospital: act like one. And take these.,102. You win a trip to the second floor. Next!
"All right, no fEver, no rash, you're fine. Take these two pills, and show this blue slip to Security on your way out. Next!","Take these, go home, talk to your daughter."
What?,"Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned. Everything except your jacket, it's got a smudge on it. PRobably two days old. Which means you didn't know the jacket had been worn. So either your husband is a crossdresser or your daughter has been borrowing your clothes without telling you. PRobably wants to look older to get into bars."
I don't have a daughter.,Next!
It's treatable as long as you go to the second floor. Next.,Yow.
FEver. Does that mean I have it?,You have a rash? Come on.
"It's from my new bathing suit, I've had it a week.","Yeah. Does your neck hurt? If it does, you get the trifecta."
It's nothing. I pulled it trying to do a three-and-a-half tuck.,Where are your parents?
We live in Parkcago. I'm here with my coach. I wanted to see what you were writing.,Go like this. Now like this.
Take these pills. A blue slip will get you out of here. Next!,You're coming with me.
Or maybe it's meningitis.,"She's had the rash a week. If it was this meningitis, she'd be dead by now."
You guys figure we're done down there? The 800 people milling around are just waiting for the bathroom?,"12-year-old female. FEver, rash, neck pains. Not meningitis."
It's the definition of meningitis!,"Sure, pus in the spinal canal makes it hurt to move your head up and down, but her head only hurts moving side to side."
"Oh, side to side.",Doesn't fit.
"The three of you, lobby, now.",Those little pills you're passing out so efficiently aren't going to do Miss Louganis squat.
You just don't want to deal with the epidemic.,"That's right. I'm subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous and evasive tests to avoid being bored. Okay, maybe I would do that, but I'm not. If it turns out she does have meningitis, you're right, you win, but if we go back downstairs and she dies! your face will be so red."
You have one hour.,Get a lumbar puncture. Some brain infections can be pretty clEver at hide-and-seek.
I'll get on her bloodwork.,"No you won't. You, sir, will research all the causes in the universe of neck pain."
"The list is, like, two miles long!",Start with the letter A. And put her on rifampin.
"Rifampin is for meningitis. You just said """,In case I'm wrong. It has happened.
"Try to relax, Mary, try to relax.",What letter are you up to?
A.,"Torture combing through all that stuff, ain't it? Real dull. Awful."
It's no pRoblem.,"Well, thank goodness. A lot of people would resent having to do this."
"BeliEve it or not, this is a camera. You swallow it, and it goes all the way through your system. The antennae pick up the signal from the pill. We're going to look at the video of your intestines, see where the blood is coming from, and fix it. Water? Down the hatch.",Think I've seen this movie. The ending's kind of dark. Want one? How come you did the endoscopy?
"Her blood pressure was high, I was worried ""","Foreman is not your boss. When I tell you to do something "" whoa. Hold it there. Back it up a couple of frames. Oh, yeah! That's your money shot."
I don't see anything.,Really? Ginormous thing on the right side of her intestine doesn't Even intrigue you?
"Oh. Well, we can burn off the swollen blood vessel, but it still doesn't account for her other symptoms.","No, but it does tell us something. Though I have no idea what."
Could be a precursor to intestinal intussusception.,Precursor isn't causing all of her other symptoms. What else?
"You, in the lobby, now.",I hurt my leg. I have a note.
"You had your hour. Three, actually.","Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us when our time was up. She has intestinal bleeding."
She'll wait. Two more buses just arrived. We need you downstairs.,"No, you need more nurses. But you cut back on the nursing staff so you have doctors doing what the nurses should be doing."
That's true. I wonder if that has anything to do you with you costing us $100 million.,"Go, be free."
"Well, the lab's working at double their capacity, maybe someone screwed up.","No fEver, no neck pain. Take the elevator to the third floor."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong form. No fEver, no neck pain, she's fine.","Smell her hair, no chlorine. Which means she wasn't at the pool. Which means she's come to a quarantined area because she's a idiot or she's insane. No one is that stupid. East wing, psych ward, bye-bye."
Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.,You up to Bs? Well done!
"It would account for all her meningial symptoms. Rash, fEver! You're fine. Take these two pills!",Get a sample of her bone marrow.
From here?,Break time.
Need more than 15 minutes.,"Use Chase's break, too. Go."
You should just fire Chase.,"What, and miss out on all this fun?"
So you're going to torture him for a while and then fire him? That's cold.,You don't think he has it coming?
"Hey, I said fire him.",That's cold. All he did was save his job.
What? He completely screwed you over!,"Right rudder. Bank, bank, bank!"
"Good coffee? The rest of this hospital is busting it's tail, and! What are you doing?",Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods.
"I am! working, it got hot, stop acting like a 13-year-old!","Sorry, you just don't usually see breasts like that on Deans of Medicine."
"Oh, women can't be heads of hospitals? Or just ugly ones?","No, they can be babes. You just don't usually see their funbags."
Your 3 o'clock interview for Dr. Cameron's position is in your office.,"Ah, not interviewing today. I don't know if you've heard, but there's this big time epidemic. Many sick people puking in the hallways, it's crazy."
That's right.,He's in a band.
You into music?,Totally. What kind of music do you play?
"Um, mostly blues, you know. James Cotton, some original stuff.","Oh, dude. You are so hired."
Really?,Not a chance.
Why?,Tattoo.
Wow. I thought you'd be the last person to have a pRoblem with nonconformity.,"Nonconformity, right. I can't remember the last time I saw a 20-something kid with a tattoo of an Asian letter on his wrist. You are one wicked free thinker. You want to be a rebel? Stop being cool. Wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut. Like the Asian kids who don't leave the library for 20 hours stretches, they're the ones who don't care what you think. Sayonara."
So should I go through all the resumes looking for Asian names?,"Actually, the Asian kids are pRobably just responding to parental pressure, but my point is still valid."
"I need some help over here! Push two milligrams Ativan, stat!",Are you sure it was an absence seizure?
Absolutely. She was totally unresponsive and unaware of what was going on around her.,Do you mind? We're trying to work.
We should get back out there. Cuddy's going to be looking for us.,"Looking, but not finding. You do an EEG?"
Seizure frequency's increasing. They're almost constant now. 5 in the last half hour.,Which tells us!
And it's getting worse.,"And? Good lord, are you having a bowel movement or a baby?"
"No, can't be drugs. She's tested at Every meet she competes in.",A bleed in the brain can cause seizures.
You think she's eating off the floor of her folks' garage?,Doesn't have to be.
Who would poison a 12-year-old?,"Well, let's see now, there's the 18-year-old has-been that she beat out to make Nationals, the has-been's parents, jealous siblings, sociopathic swim fan, and then there's just your plain old garden variety whack job. Hey! You know what a hemorrhoid is?"
No.,"Well, google it. And try some Raisin Bran instead of the donuts. Okay, do a CT scan, check for intercranial bleeding."
"Not a chance, radiology's totally swamped.","If our Patient's bleeding into her brain, she's gonna be dead in 8 hours."
"When I was in med school, I had this old professor """,-- who touched you in the naughty place?
"Before the CT scan was introduced, he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.","Hmm. Ancient, but if there's enough bleeding it might work. Okay, do what the guy who didn't specialize in neurology said."
It was my idea!,You've still got to cover Q-Z.
You've still got to cover Q-Z.,"Sorry I'm late, I was taking a dump."
"Dr. Petra Gilmar, Dr. Gregory House.","You actually speak four languages, or you just banking on nEver being interviewed by anyone who does?"
It's true. And I can swear in two more.,"Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel? Did you fall for him and can't handle it, or is it the other way around?"
"No, it was nothing like that.",You Jewish?
Yes.,Is it true what they say about Jewish foreplay?
Two hours of begging?,I heard four.
That's our Hitler!,No way.
"Are you kidding? Her background's perfect, she's smart, she can obviously deal with your insanity!",Did you see her shoes?
"Her shoes? What, did your horoscope in Vogue tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes?","The eyes can mislead, the smile can lie, but the shoes always tell the truth."
They were Prada. It means she has good taste.,They were not Prada. You wouldn't know Prada if one stepped on your scrotum.
"Okay, well, they were nice, pointy!","Exactly, they were stylish, and very painful to wear. Only an incredibly shallow and insecure Woman would rather be in pain all day then wear a decent looking, comfortable shoe, and that's exactly the type I don't need around here."
I'm ultrasounding your head. You're still having seizures. This should help us figure out what's going on.,Blue form to the security guard.
You're not going to be happy with anyone.,"So what, your advice is... hire someone I'm not happy with and be happy?"
"No, my advice is much more subtle. Stop being an ass. You always find some tiny little flaw to push people away.",Now it's people. I thought we were talking about fellowship applicants.
You have a history of this.,"Well, when I do decide to push you away, I hope there's a small person kneeling behind you so you fall down and hurt your head."
"Take these, there's water over there, blue form to the guard, and you're done. You had the perfect person, and you blew it.",You saw the shoes!
I'm not talking about her.,You're talking about Cameron.
I'm talking about Every Woman you've Ever given a damn about.,Cameron is so not perfect.
"Well, nobody's perfect.",Mother Teresa?
Dead.,Angelina Jolie?
No medical degree.,Now who's being picky?
"He's a little dehydrated, put him on a saline drip and give him some orange juice.",I need an operating room and a surgeon.
"Oh, well, given the current crisis I'm tempted to say no, but since you've been so sweet to me today """,Our little mermaid is bleeding into her temporal lobe.
How fast can you have her prepped?,20 minutes.
Got a better idea?,"Stop it. Stop looking for things we don't know and focus on what we do know. What do we actually know besides what's up there? Come on, how hard can it be to tell me what you already know?"
But nEver out of the country.,What else? Come on!
What else? Come on!,We're missing something.
What?,"Well, if I knew that it wouldn't be missing."
Maybe she's adopted and we've got the wrong history.,"No, she's got her mom's eyes and a red patch of hair just like dad."
"Could explain the rash and muscle pain, but not the bleeding or seizures.",That's a lot of balloons.
Think she's allergic to polyester?,Not unless she's been competing in the nude all these years.
Then what are you thinking? What do the balloons mean?,What if the rash isn't a rash?
What are you talking about?,Who gave her the balloons?
"Some of the girls from her team. They've been visiting her pretty regularly, but none of them are sick.",What about the guys?
None of them are sick either.,Which guys visited her?
"Actually, none.","She's cute, she's nice, she's a kick-ass diver. You'd think the guys would be falling over themselves to get close to her."
She's 12. The youngest guy on her team is 16.,"Okay, so maybe they're just not interested. Or!"
They're avoiding her.,There any cell fragments in her blood smears?
"No, red blood cells were intact.",Check 'em again.
"Blood looks like it's been put through the blender, now.",You done yet?
Thrombocytopenia purpura?,Starts with T. You were so close.
"What could have set it off? She had no trace of E. Coli in her cultures, she's obviously not menopausal, so no estrogen.",There is one other possible cause.
"Oh, God.","Pregnancy cause all kinds of chemical and biological changes in a Woman's body. Or a girl's body, as the case may be. In extremely rare cases, Everything goes haywire. It's called TTP. Blood starts clotting like crazy, clogs the vessels in your brain and kidneys. Red blood cells end up getting shredded as they squeeze past the clot like a fat guy in a crowed bar. I'm sure you know what that's like. You're only 12, but you're all grown up, right? Travel on your own, hang out in hotel rooms getting room service with your teammates, maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers, you start playing spin the bottle! next thing you know you're waking up in nothing but your socks."
It wasn't like that.,Of course not. You wanted it.
"Yeah, I did. He turned out to be a jerk, but!","Actually, under New Jersey law the term is 'felon.'"
I knew what I was doing.,We're going to have to do something called plasmapheresis. It cleans the antibodies from your blood. We're also going to have to terminate the pregnancy.
You're going to tell my parents?,Someone should. Rock paper scissors?
They don't need to know. I'll be all right.,"Of course you will. If you're old enough to bleed out of your vagina, obviously you're old enough to handle a simple thing like an abortion without Mommy and Daddy's help."
You're going to tell my parents?,"Under New Jersey law, you're the boss."
"Under New Jersey law, you're the boss.","Your daughter has TTP. Don't worry, it's curable, she'll be fine."
"Well, wait! What does TTP stand for?",Some really big words that you've nEver heard before and when we're done we'll nEver hear again. Have a nice day.
"Well, when can we take her home?","Uh, in a few days. She needs some minor surgery to remove the underlying cause before we can do the! another really big word."
What's the underlying cause?,She has an abnormal growth in her abdomen.
What kind of surgery?,It's very simple. We do it here all the time.
Could you be a little more specific?,"Actually, no. I'm sorry."
"Plasmapheresis is working, she's going to be fine.",I know.
"I can't Even tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you. The moment I heard you had another fellowship opening, I """,There is no opening.
"House, you have to hire someone.",I know. The position's been filled.
Why am I interviewing for a position that's already been filled?,Exactly.
I called to confirm the interview this morning.,"You figure if you keep arguing I'm going to cave, admit it's all a lie, and hire you?"
Do you need your Parking validated?,I don't want to interview anyone else.
You're interviewing? I thought you'd just have them send a headshot along with their CV.,Hah. That's good. And why I need you around. To keep me in my place.
"I can't come back, I told you that.",Wasn't listening.
Right.,You want me to listen to you more? I can do that.
Right. I already accepted a position somewhere else.,With who?
"Yule, at Jefferson.",Unaccept it.
Why?,Because Yule is boring. He's pedantic and preachy. Because he's short. Because I want you to come back.
Not good enough.,"Want more money? A car allowance, better Parking space?"
Dinner. And not just a meal between two colleagues. A date.,You'll come back to work if I go out on a date with you?
Yes.,"Okay, it's a deal."
See you tomorrow morning.,Don't be late.
Who's coming back?,You don't know her.
You give her a raise? Increase her benefits?,"Don't have TiVo on this thing, can't rewind. Shut up."
You lower her hours?,You don't Even know her.
Who is this guy?,He's a Patient.
He's examining me.,"He's got to go back to work as soon as I'm done with the examination. Guess I do, too."
Heh heh! You dog! You slept with her!,Keep talking. I'll finish your exam with a prostate check. I've agreed to take her on one date.
"Yes """,No! She's not giving me any choice.
Wait! she's making you do her?,Date her.
"Do her, or you're gay.",For God's sake.
"Sitting in a tree, K-i-s-s-i-n-g.",Grow up. And learn to harmonize. Damn it!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,Who the hell walks around with an open urine sample?
You think that was a bit of an overreaction?,"Well, he peed on me. I'm not into that."
It's apple juice. Now go find that Man and apologize. One more Patient complaint and you're looking at a suspension.,"I forgive you for ruining my jacket. Look, you seem like a regular kind of guy, not the type to get another regular guy into trouble, am I right? Twenty bucks cash if you'll stop crying. Forgive me, yell at me, just give me something I can work with, okay?"
Game's over. You two make nice?,"Get a wheelchair, and get this guy into the ER."
What happened?,Right pupil's blown.
Then why'd you do it?,"Cause this is the happiest place on Earth. 21-year-old male, comes in with grinding of the teeth."
Blown pupils usually means brain stem edema.,"Sure, but since he's not dead or in a coma, I'm going with stroke to the optic nerve. CT scan shows two things."
"Ischemia. Death of brain tissue. Means there's been some damage, hopefully not perManent.",And?
That's it. There's nothing there to tell us what the underlying cause is. We've got to do an MRI.,You're looking at the wrong part of the scan.
"No, the jaw tells us why we can't do an MRI. Unless we want his jawbone flying across the room.","Metal plate. He's had major reconstruction and there's no way we're removing it, so we're forced to be clEver. Angiogram to rule out vascultis, EMG for peripheral neuropathy, tox screen to eliminate drugs, an echo to rule out cardiac emboli. Dr. Cameron. I'd appreciate you keeping the terms of your new contract to yourself. Don't want Everyone clamoring for the same perks."
Hi. I'm having vaginal pain.,Pleasure to meet you.
My OB/GYN died recently. He's a nice Man. Warm hands.,"Not anymore. So, does it hurt when you tinkle?"
"Yeah, it's when it's worse.","You have some vaginal tearing. No sign of brusing, no indication of trauma, forced entry! Ramona. You naughty girl. You've either got yourself an 18-year-old boyfriend or an 80-year-old with some little blue pills."
Myron thought he'd just try them out!,Lucky you.
I guess.,Prefer it if Myron was a little droopier?
"Maybe a little. We used to hold hands, read together, or watch Jeopardy! I haven't seen Jeopardy! in almost a month!",Have you talked to him about this?
"You try talking a 73-year-old out of sex. With all these male enhancements the pressure to put out's incredible. It's worse than high school. He doesn't get what he wants from me, he'll get it from Connie in the corner condo. She's dying her hair red! Major league slut.",Here's a prescription for vaginal estrogen suppositories. It'll help with the lubrication.
"Thank you. Maybe you could give Myron a prescription. Something weaker than he's got now? Tell him it's better for his heart "" he'd buy that.","You can't tell him the truth, so you want me to lie to him?"
Would you?,Close your legs.
The EMG was clean.,"Well, based on this history it's either toxic herbs from the homeopath, spinal damage from the Parkropractor, infection from the needle that the acupuncturist accidentally let sit in eye of newt, or the Shen balancer. What the hell is a ""shen"" and how come it's lopsided?"
The only abnormal test result we found was on the echo report. Mitral valve prolapse.,"Hang up a shingle and condemn the narrowness and greed of Western medicine, you'd make a damn fine living."
"Clot's formed on a faulty valve, gets sent to the brain, voila! Stroke.","Of course, no harm, no foul. It's just taking a few bucks from superstitious idiots, right?"
"Trauma? From what, the Parkropractic treatments? It's bacterial endocarditis, an infected valve. We should do blood cultures.",Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world. But that's just me being all narrow again.
"No, not necessarily.","Hmm. Quite a dilemma. Oh, great pool hall oracle, grant me guidance. Do we go with Foreman's theory, which is at least marginally supported by medical test results, or Chase's theory, which is completely unsupported by medical evidence. What to do!"
The guy obviously broke his jaw somehow. Who knows what other trauma he's suffered? We should do the angiogram again.,"And all signs point to! Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken. Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics."
That's just sick.,"Well, that's an intriguing legal opinion. Geez, what kind of a Lawyer is he?"
"I was careful. I watched the monitors, made sure his O2 stats were over 90. I would nEver hurt him.",Then what was the point?
"We're not done here, we have to talk!","Call the cops, bar her from the hospital, force her to pierce your nipples! not really medical decisions."
"It was a weird scene. I observed """,Chase. Did you know about this Woman? What she does?
"I met her at some parties, yeah.","I wouldn't have tortured you if I knew you liked it. Well, here's a phrase to remember: ""Hey, this guy might have been pounded on the head one too Many times!"""
I said I thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.,"Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you'd mentioned the ""liking pain"" thing. You're on my naughty list. Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas."
"I'm not into """,I assume you nEver started him on antibiotics or blood thinners before Mistress Ilsa's rude interruption.
It was pRobably a good thing.,Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners.
You still think Chase is wrong?,"No, he's pRobably right."
"If we put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.","But if Foreman's right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we """
I think Chase is right.,"Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we'll pRobably kill the guy. So, start him on blood thinners, and if he has another stroke, then we'll schedule the surgery. Yeah?"
You Dr. House?,"I have a feeling I'm going to regret this, but yes."
"Ramona said I should come to you for my refill. Uh, with, for the beginning to droop? She said you'd pRobably want to talk to me first.",She lied. Here you go.
Thanks.,Always happy to make people happy. Goodbye.
"I "" I don't know how much more of this I can take.",How much more of what?
Sex.,You don't want more sex?
My golf swing is all messed up.,"Hey, here's a radical thought. Talk to her."
The truth?,Sounds crazy when you put it like that.
"Oh, Ramona's got a big appetite. If I don't perform, I don't want to lose her. You got a pharmacy around here?",In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.
In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.,Got any blue pills?
You looking for ED medication?,"Well, that's one example of a blue pill. Name six others."
There's a brand of acetaminophen out!,Perfect. Fill her up.
Dr. House.,Little busy here.
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions for coming back to work.,It's purely business. I'll make sure you get the recipt.
"Well, I think it's a good thing. What happened in your last relationship, it's no reason to wall yourself from people forEver. 5 years of self-pity is pRobably enough.","Wow. Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about. If only I was as open as you."
"Well ""","Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about."
Weakness in his right arm and hand. Harvey's having mini-strokes; the blood thinners aren't making a difference.,"Stop the treatment. Sorry, we tried your way, you could not have been wronger."
I said Chase was pRobably right.,"Oh yeah, we've all got perfect 20-20 hindsight. Get a hold of Main in vascular, see if his surgical dance card is free for tomorrow."
About tomorrow night.,You couldn't keep your mouth shut.
I didn't see any reason to. Where are we going? I want to make sure I dress appropriately.,That would be army boots and t-shirt. It's the county paintball tourney. First prize is fifty bucks; I'll split it with you if you hold your end up.
I'm not sure if that was the deal.,Relax. I made a reservation at Café Spiletto. Regarding wardRobe: are you too young to remember spandex?
"I already did. Mashed them up in his applesauce, it'll lighten him up soon enough.",Someone should just tell him to do it. Way faster.
And I already tried.,Not you. Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?
Annette's barred from the hospital.,"If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush. And beliEve me, she knows how to use it."
"So, what's that, two strokes you've scared this guy into?",Yeah. It's making me question my view of myself as a people person.
He said no. We can't do it.,"Emergent situation, invoke heroic measures."
You need a court order.,"Great, where do I get me one of them? Do I need to Lawyer up?"
I'll need to show the Judge an affidavit from next of kin.,"Well, they might have a pRoblem signing anything seeing as how they're dead."
He'll want proof.,"Like what, dad's hand? I don't Even know where they're buried."
"They guy lives in Market Town. I don't know if he grew there, but we could check the local funeral home.","Great, and when your searches turn up nothing you should try to find out where they live."
He said they were dead.,"Accountants, they're usually pretty good with money, so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?"
Maybe they were bad accountants.,Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim? The odds are astronomical.
Or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.,"That'd be my bet. Go to his apartments. See if you can find his folks. Address, number, something."
"Hey, can I talk to you?",Sure.
"Look, Cameron's a friend. This whole dating thing """,Time's up. Thanks for playing.
"Hey, I've been on the scene more than you recently.","Way ahead of you. I've got a case of malt liquor stashed in the trunk, Mr. Marvin Gaye on the CD, we are gonna get all the way down. Now move."
"Come on, you're not into her. Most guys who aren't interested in a Woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.","Oh, you know me too well."
That's what I'm saying. I think you should go with your instincts here. Be a jerk.,I'm missing my soap for this?
"Women love to be right. You've got to leave them feeling superior. Like they've dodged a bullet. If you're nice, she'll blame herself """,And fall for me Even more. The Love Doctor has made an art of breaking up with women. 'Cause you're convinced that the loss of you would be too devastating for any Woman to handle.
Call back.,"I'll do it. Let the master show you how it's done. Mr. Park? This is Dr. House calling from Princeton-Plainsboro TeaParkng Hospital in New Jersey. Your son Harvey is dead. We need you to identify the body. Yes, I'm sorry, it's the law. There's a real art to delivering bad news."
They're gonna show up at the morgue.,Be sure to let me know when Cuddy starts screaming.
He told us our son was dead.,"It's only a white lie. Technically, all I did was call them a little early. Trust me, he'll be dead real soon. Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic."
I'm calling our Lawyer.,Fine. Just as soon as you sign this surgery consent. I have a pen.
He humiliated us. Everybody we know knows about his perversion.,But you don't get off on embarrassment the way your son does. I guess it skips a generation.
"How much money would it take to compensate you ""","Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute. But here's the thing. Humiliation comes in all kinds of packages. People finding out that your son's a perv, that's pretty high up there. People finding out that you'd rather let your son die than sign a piece of paper, where's that rank? And trust me, if I have to paste up a sign in Every nail salon and dumpling shop in Pennsylvania, I'll make sure they know. Your son will be in surgery first thing in the morning. Dumplings, that was a cheap shot."
The wide side's too short. You're gonna look like Lou Costello.,"This is a mistake. I don't know how to have casual conversation. You think you're talking about one thing, and either you are and it's incredibly boring, or you're not because it's subtext and you need a decoder ring."
"Open doors for her, help her with her chair """,I have been on a date.
"Uh, not since disco died. Comment on her shoes, her earrings, and then move on to D.H.A. Her dreams, hopes and aspirations. Trust me. Panty-peeler. Oh, and if you need condoms, I've got some.",Did your wife give them to you?
"Drug rep. They've got antibiotics built in, somehow.",I should cancel. I've got a Patient in surgery tomorrow.
"And if you were a surgeon, that would actually matter. That's a good idea, settle your nerves. Get me a beer, too.",No beer.
You're gonna eat before dinner?,"This is pretty lame, right?"
It's beautiful. And you look very handsome.,Thank you.
I've always loved this restaurant.,Yeah. It's changed a lot since the last time I was here. It used to be a strip joint. Nice earrings.
My mom's. Thank you.,Nice shoes. Comfortable?
I'm not expecting you to be someone you're not.,"We're in a restaurant, we're dressed up, we're eating. If not small talk, what is there?"
"According to Freud, and I'm paraphrasing, instinct of love toward an object deMands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it. Like an eighth-grade boy punParkng a girl.","I treat you like garbage, so I must really like you. Given your Freudian theory, what does it mean if I start being nice to you?"
That you're getting in touch with your feelings.,Hmm. So there's absolutely nothing I can do to make you think that I don't like you.
"Sorry, no. I have one Evening with you, one chance, and I don't want to waste it talking about what wines you like or what movies you hate. I want to know how you feel about me.","You live under the delusion that you can fix Everything that isn't perfect. That's why you married a Man who was dying of cancer. You don't love, you need. And now that your husband is dead, you're looking for your new charity case. That's why you're going out with me. I'm twice your age, I'm not great looking, I'm not charming, I'm not Even nice. What I am is what you need. I'm damaged."
"It was fine, how was your Evening?","She had the ravioli, I had the puttanesca."
"Yes, I really want to know about the quality of the food. Either something very good happened, or something very bad. Which is it?","Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards. Maybe it was the garlic bread."
"It was the wine. We had a nice, candid conversation.","Nothing deep, mostly small talk."
I'm sure.,"Took your advice, complimented her shoes, that's fifteen minutes of chat right there."
You two going to do dinner again?,I don't think so.
"Maybe we should go back to the blood thinners, up the dosage.","If it's not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears. Then he won't be able to hear. Oy ve. Nobody home, leave a message!"
This is important!,"Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo. Better get a full-body scan. If it is clots, it'd be good to know where they are. Sorry about that. Guy dying."
"Those pills you gave Myron, they're not working.","Well, glad to see you've got the correct perspective on the thing."
"Well, the old ones, you know, made me feel like a tree!",Nice visual.
"The new ones, well, might as well be eating candy.",Candy wouldn't take away your headaches.
What?,You came to me and told me that you were having too much sex.
I nEver did!,"You too, Sequoia."
"Well no, that's not true, I!","I know that Everybody lies, but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn't be trying so hard. Your rings don't match."
"What, well, why would they?","Well, style is one thing, but one silver, one gold? How long have you guys been married?"
55 years.,"Damn it, you're having an affair."
I just need a little rest.,"You guys aren't the victim of the little blue pill, you're the pRoblem!"
"Me, too. I should just have told you how I felt.","Aw. Oh, welcome to hell."
"Hey, how 'bout the pills?",Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.
Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.,"Dr. Chase, these breath mints you've been popping since yesterday. Are they a new fetish?"
"Oh, I got them at Harvey's. What, I just took two boxes; the guy's got a whole drawer of them!",And you didn't find that interesting.
"Well, there's lots of interesting stuff at his place. The mints weren't high up on the list.",Wrong.
Wrong.,"Chase, get your nose in here."
"If you're trying to humiliate me, I told you ""","Come on, just put your face in his mouth."
Ugh.,"Rich, wouldn't you say?"
Uh. Smells like old vomit.,Number one sign of fulminating osteomylitis.
Infection of the jaw?,"PRobably from the original break. NEver healed properly. Infected tissue from the jaw breaks off, blocks blood flow to the brain, and life just isn't worth living without blood."
So how do we confirm?,"Like this. Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus. We're gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw? Okay, call a surgeon."
"Like this. Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus. We're gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw? Okay, call a surgeon.","Hi, I'm Dr. House. How's tricks, Annette?"
I just wanted to see if he was okay. I'll leave.,"No, it's okay. I came to talk to you both. Like I tell all my Patients, you've simply got to say ""no"" to strangulation. Me, I'm a freak, I get off on not being in pain. That, and chocolate-covered marshmallow bunnies."
He's not a freak.,"Yeah, he is. A little. But it's got to stop. Or he'll die."
"It's not about pain. It's about being open, being completely vulnerable to another person. If you can learn to be that deeply trusting! it changes you.","Well, lock him in a cage. That should be fine, medically."
Dr. Riley is throwing up; he obviously can't lecture,"You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it? I think I'm coming down with a little bit of the clap. I may have to go home for a few days."
Dr. Riley doesn't have a history of lying to me.,You said this is the fifth time he's missed a class this year! Either he's dying or he's lying.
I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.,"Fine, I'll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. [He starts to walk off."
You'll do it.,Why is it always me?
Because the world hates you. Or because it's a class on diagnostics. Pick whatEver reason feeds your narcissism better.,I'm not doing it. You're supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.
"Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.",I'll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.
"Dr. House, there's a Patient.","I'm outta here, take it up with Cuddy."
Gregg.,"Hi, Stacy."
How're you doing?,"How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like! you Ever see those ""Girls Gone Wild"" videos?"
"Your life's been like that, or your life's been spent watParkng them? I have missed you.",Is that why you're here?
I need your help.,Who am I looking at?
My husband.,"Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells. No sign of tumors, no vasculitis. Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone. A little one, can pack a lot of wallop."
Did you think I wasn't going to get married?,Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy's pancreas is pathetic.
"There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.","Well, maybe there's nothing to be found."
"Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.",The walks are out.
"I was around you long enough to know when something's not right. Mark's had personality changes, he's acting strange, disconnected!",Interesting. It means there's either a neurological component or he's having an affair.
"No affair, no nothing! He's sick! I know you're not too busy; you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I'm asking you a favor.","I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again."
"I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again.","Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What's wrong with them? I'm not going to like you, am I?"
Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.,"Statistically, you're right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That's six legs. So, you've got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant."
What were they doing when pain presented?,I have no idea.
You didn't ask? You didn't take a history?,"Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened. Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence. Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control. Person B, volleyball practice. Coach figured it was a pulled muscle. And C, we've got Carmen Electra. Golfing."
"Whoa, you treated the Baywatch Parkck?","The Baywatch thespian. And no, I've gotta disguise the identity of each of the Patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged Man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she's apparently quite the golfer. Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which? Okay, I say we start with the farmer."
"The Baywatch thespian. And no, I've gotta disguise the identity of each of the Patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged Man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative.

Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which? Okay, I say we start with the farmer.","Did you hike to the fence, and how far?"
"Yes, it's about half a mile from my farmHouse.",And where's the pain localized?
It started just above my ankle and it's radiating up.,"So, what should we do first?"
Family history?,"Indicative of leg pain? That's a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma?"
"If the pRoblem's vascular, he's better off ""","Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient's dead. You killed him."
We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!,You had time to look at the leg.
I thought we were starting with the farmer's case first.,We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!
We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!,I need you to take off your pants. Puncture.
Snakebite.,That would be my guess.
Farmer didn't know he had been bit by a snake?,"That's what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, nEver saw a thing."
What kind of snake?,You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don't know what kind of snake it is?,"Oh, there are people to find those things out."
The guy might only have a couple of hours.,"And while we wait for the HuMane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?"
"How old is this person? I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old Man on a girls' volleyball team, right?",It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.
"Well, I was just worried that """,Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
"Obviously we should care about our Patients no matter what age ""","Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She's mine, stay away. Would you operate on your mother?"
Of course not. I'd be too nervous; couldn't be objective.,Then why are you so anxious to treat Every Patient like they're family? The actual Patient is 16. Here's what happens when doctors care to much.
"I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson's, or any other degenerative condition. But there's this boy at school, and he's on the boys' volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won't call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn't like her and nEver did.",You got all this from an examination of the knee?
I think she's depressed.,She doesn't have tendoni
She has tendonitis.,She's depressed about having tendonitis.
She's depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.,Not the boy.
"No, the boy's a jerk, she knows that, and yet she's depressed. I found a nodule.","Ah. PRoblems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons."
"So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.","No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test."
"No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.",Here's how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.
Can I put my pants back on now?,I'd rather you didn't.
Which Carmen Electra is this?,First one. The golfer.
Then why isn't she wearing pants?,You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone?
Slipped disc?,Could be. How bad does it hurt?
"It hurts really, really bad.",Yeah?
It doesn't seem real. Is she the one faking?,"Oh, for God's sake. She's here to play out my fantasy, not because she's Meryl Streep. Fine."
Or it could be referred pain from his groin.,"Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else?"
He's curling; it's not the back.,"Sir, where are you getting pain?"
Help me!,Oooh.
"We have no history, he could be allergic.",What do I do?
"Better than killing him with pain killers, then ""","Apparently, he's not allergic."
We screwed up.,"No, you did exactly what his attending did."
And that was the proper way to handle the case?,Yeah.
The guy used him as a dealer!,"You're going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there's a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm!"
It's not going to stay that way. Paddles!,"What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee."
You didn't think she was going to get married?,She asked me the same question.
And! what? You're not gonna treat him?,There's pRobably nothing wrong with him.
"Oh, sure, that makes sense. She's just using the old ""sick husband"" routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she'd be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.",So I should help her because she hates me.
Found him.,The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you'd expect in a case of tendonitis.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don't really care about the volleyball player.",What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
Really?,"No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It's not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true."
You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.,"No, I didn't. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the Patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition."
"So, that's it?","You were right the first time. Snakebite guy's way more interesting. Gross, actually."
He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it's a timber rattlesnake.,"No, it's not. Notice the volume?"
I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.,200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There's no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.
We're supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?,Nope. Unless you've got a Patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?
He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.,"Or you go online and find there's only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy."
So we give him the antivenin for the other one.,Is that a question?
"Well, we can't just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?",Very good.
We've gotta find the right snake.,"No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was."
So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.,"Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin? And who goes looking for the snake?"
I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.,That's usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.,Yeah.
"But we can't be blamed for ""","I'm sure this goes against Everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist.

It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong.",We gave the guy the antivenin.
He came back?,"On average, drug addicts are stupid."
I'd call the cops.,Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn't risk their careers on a hunch.
"It's not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.","I beliEve drug addicts get sick. Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts. Luckily, you don't have to play your hunch, there's a faster way. Actually, there are sEveral. My preference is urine testing."
But you already know he has drugs in his system.,That's not what I'm testing for.
That's not what I'm testing for.,"We're going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable."
Shouldn't I be getting some kind of anesthetic?,We're concerned about allergic reactions today.
We're concerned about allergic reactions today.,"If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he's really sick."
Or he's really jonesing.,"There's easier ways to get a hold of drugs. Other hospitals, for example. The volleyball player is not responding to treatment. At least we think it's not working on account of the fact she's getting worse. Can you still hear me?"
Not really!,"Well, if you can't hear me, how do you know what I asked?"

"The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH ""","-- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that's enough about the volleyball player. What's up with the farmer?"
What farmer?,"Snakebite guy. Oh, right, you guys don't know about him. He doesn't get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player. Luckily, it's been well established that time is not a fixed construct. His condition's not improving; double the dosage."
Already did.,"There's another antivenin, it's not as effective, but """
Already tried it.,"The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to """
Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing's working.,What does it all mean?
Wrong snake?,We tried Every other antivenin we had.
We're too late?,"Yep. He's dying. His wife's here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I'm kidding."
He's not dying?,"Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the ""breaking the news"" thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news."
"Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the ""breaking the news"" thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.",The drug addict is peeing blood.
The drug addict is peeing blood.,How do they teach you how to tell someone that they're dying? It's kind of like teaParkng arParktects how to explain why their building fell down. Do you roleplay and stuff?
"Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.","And what do you have to do to get an A in You're Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks Every time somebody says ""Thank you."" Imagine that. This guy's so good, people thank him for telling them that they're dying. Eh, needs brown. I don't get thanked that often."

"Well, I need to go home.",You're not going home.
"Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying and all he cares about is his dog?",Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It's a basic truth of the huMan condition that Everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they're dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they're willing to die for. What they're willing to lie for.

"I got his head, just do it!","What would you call that? That's tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs! what's the differential diagnosis for urine that's tea-colored?"
Kidney stone.,Kidney stones would cause what?
Blood in urine.,What color is your pee?
Yellow.,What color is your blood?
Red.,What colors did I use?
"Red, yellow and brown.",And brown. What causes brown?
Wastes.,Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?
Trauma.,None that his history would indiCate.
Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.,Treatment?
"Heat and rest """,Other possible causes.
Infection.,"Start him on antibiotics. What else? Come on, come on!"
"I "" I don't know.","You're useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?"

"You know, it's kind of hard to think when you're in our face like this """,Yeah? You think it's going to be easier when you've got a real Patient really dying? What are you missing?]
Muscle death.,Not your case.
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It's toxic to the kidneys.,"Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what's killing it."
Why is the girl getting the MRI?,Because the neck scan rEvealed nothing and her doctor's way more obsessive than she thinks she is.
But you said the guy needed the MRI.,"Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it! Not one of this guy's doctors said it. They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have."
Did he get better?,No.
"Well, how long ""","Three days. It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up. You are gonna kill someone. If you can't handle that reality, pick another profession. Or finish medical school and teach."
Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?,"No, three days before the Patient suggested it might have been muscle death."
We may need to remove the leg.,"His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn't caused by the self-injection, wasn't caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction."
"We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there's too much """,I don't care what you find.
It may become necessary in order to save your life.,I like my leg. I've had it for as long as I can remember.
"Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.",They're not cutting it off.
They're not cutting it off.,Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it's okay to cut a leg off and he's going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
"Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.","Well, of course they care about their Patients. They just care about themselves more. Which is not an unreasonable position. Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong. Which means you've gotta be extra careful. Which is such a pain in the ass."
Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.,"Yeah, they're just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation."
Amputation is safer.,"For you, or me?"
"The blockage of blood flow """,Four-day blockage.
"Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --","If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back."
"The post-operative pain alone ""","I'll get through it. I understand the risks, you're in the clear. Go schedule an OR."
"God, you're an idiot.",I think I'm more of a jerk.
"I'm not being glib. And I'm not being cute, I don't want you to kill yourself.",I'm not gonna die.
"Oh, I feel completely reassured.",I think they gotta up that morphine.
The doctors say they can't.,The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
"They screwed up, it doesn't mean they're wrong this time.",Sure doesn't mean they're right.
Morphine will kill you.,I can handle it.
"You're in pain, you're not thinking right.",That's why I need the damn morphine!
Yeah.,Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
You just had 5 mLs.,The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
I'll talk to your doctor.,"Well, you better make it fast, 'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia."
"I could get in trouble ""","Listen, it's not a narcotic! I'm not looking for a buzz. You've got about twenty seconds. I was wrong."
Clear!,The Patient was technically dead for over a minute.
Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?,"Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant! Personally, I choose to beliEve that the white light people sometimes see visions, this Patient saw. They're all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down."
You choose to beliEve that?,"There's no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting."
You find it more comforting to beliEve that this is it?,I find it more comforting to beliEve that this isn't simply a test.
How bad is the pain right now?,It's bad.
"It's not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You'd be getting better.",It's just taking longer.
"No, it's not. We've got to let him cut the leg off.",It's my leg. It's my life.
Would you give up your leg to save my life?,Of course I would.
"Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other Patient, what would you tell them to do?",I would say it's their choice.
"Wha "" not a chance! You'd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg! You don't think you deserve to live? You don't think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg?","I can't, I can't, I'm sorry."
The pain alone is going to kill you.,"I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor."
You'll be out in less than a minute.,Thank you. Hey.
Hey.,I'll see you when I wake up. We'll go golfing. I love you.
"I love you, too. I'm sorry.",You've got nothing to be sorry about.
He won't see it that way.,"Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the Patient's leg was sEverely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, Patient continues to experience chronic pain."
The Patient's an idiot.,They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?
Twenty minutes ago.,I'm not doing this again. And this guy is not the world's greatest dad. Not Even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That's why he's always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again.

Because I didn't tell him you'd be here.,He likes to see.
"Hey """,Hi. I'm Gregg House. You must be Matt.
Hi. Wow. Gregg House.,Yeah. Wow.
"No, I haven't been avoiding you, I just didn't want to waste your time. The other doctors checked me out and they said it was just stress. College season, kids, parents, they're all over me.",Makes sense to me.
"Gregg """,What do you want me to do?
You said you'd check him out!,He says he's healthy. What's to check out?
"Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad you two got a chance to catch up. Looks like you're having fun.","Oh, he's good. If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything. I can't tell you how much I like your fella."
"Yeah, me too. You know, I thought you'd be all sarcastic, bitter, you know, because Stacy married me.","You know, we should do things together. Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff."
We could go for a run together.,Hah! He's Oscar Wilde!
"Wow, this pissing contest is really turning me on. He needs to go to the hospital.","Here's to women. You can't live with 'em, you can't kill 'em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City."

Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton-Plainsboro?,"GarÃ§on! It's okay, ladies and gentlemen, nothing to worry about. Unless you had the veal."
You dosed him!,"I told you, I'd check him out. I was a little worried they were gonna get here before he'd passed out. Would have been tougher to get him to drink. I'll give you a ride. We can talk."
I know. You made milk come out of my nose.,Morning. You guys got the file? What's wrong?
Previous tests rEvealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.,"Then we're done! What do you think, ball game, zoo? I don't care, I just want to hang with you guys."
What about drugs? His tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.,"Yeah, sorry, that was me. I had to dope him up to get him in here. Guy doesn't think he's sick."
Who does?,His wife.
The Woman you used to live with.,That's her Indian name. On her driver's license it's Stacy. I assume you have a point.
You beliEve her over the Patient himself. That's why we're taking this case.,"The truth, I hear voices. All the time. Telling me to do stuff, it's crazy, huh?"
"What happened to ""Everybody lies""?","I was lying. Do the things, the, you know, blah blah blah blah blah, all that stuff the other docs did. If that's negative, ultrasound his belly. If that's negative, CT his abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast. Did I miss anything?"
Kitchen sink?,"Well, we could certainly give that a "" oh, you minx."
"What you're thinking is, you're going to save him, be a hero, and win her back. It's always impressive, that lEvel of twisted narcissism.",She's married. Big clue I lost the game.
You can't be within fifty feet of Stacy Warner.,I thought she wanted me to treat him.
Treat the husband. Stay away from the wife.,But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?
"Hey, you have to treat this like a regular case. Be yourself: cold, uncaring, distant.","Please, don't put me on a pedestal."
"MRAs were clean, which means he's pRobably fine. He doesn't seem paranoid, he shows no signs of ""","No, it means we have no idea what's wrong with him."
Ben Goldstein says the schedule's locked. He can't do it before tomorrow.,"No, today. Call him. Tell him I'll make it work."
You're cutting him open?,"Whoa, hold it! There's no need for exploratory surgery, Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis."
"No, I just think it's premature and maybe irresponsible to do exploratory surgery before we know he's actually sick.","No, it's premature to put him on a list for hospice care. And it's maybe irresponsible to imply my actions are not rationally supported."
"All we have is his wife """,Who says that his stomach hurts. Works for me.
"The Patient doesn't Even think he's sick. Why would he consent ""","His wife's a Lawyer. She's very convincing. Call Goldstein, surgery's on."

I like sugar now. Some people would be annoyed by that.,You know why people sit in waiting rooms?
This is gonna be good.,"People think the closer they're sitting to the operating room, the more they care."
That's why I'm here. I'm not moving until Everybody sees me.,Are you doing anybody besides Mark? It's a medical question.
"Because if I am his paranoia isn't paranoia, it's a justified response? Therefore, not a legitimate symptom?",Knew you'd understand.
"Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well; he's in recovery, you can see him now. Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.",Neurogenic bladder isn't causing the pain.
"Also doesn't cause personality changes. On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron's diagnosis "" the Patient's completely healthy.",Give me the video for the surgery.
Give me the video for the surgery.,"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House."
"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.","Well, don't Everybody talk at once."
There's nothing there.,Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen. Here's why I get the big bucks. This is nothing. An enhanced version of nothing. This is the pRoblem.
Means there's some sort of neurological pRoblem.,"A time bomb in his brain. I forget, who said it was nothing?"
Saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves. PRobably white matter. Means his axonal nerves are dying. Explains the neurogenic bladder.,"Enough nerves die, he dies."
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.,He won't die right away. He'll just want to.
We'll check his blood for Alzheimer's protein markers.,Last I heard Alzheimer's had a genetic component. Patient have parents?
Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.,"Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer's. And this still feels a little light."
I took a complete medical history.,Check out their House. Take SParky with you.
"They live in Short Hills, two hours away.",You can expense the tolls.
You're not interested in the medical history. You're a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.,"Her secret diary: that's the main thing. But as long as you're there, take a peek in the medicine cabinet. Check for toxins, heavy metals! anything that would explain this other than encephalitis or Alzheimer's. And get receipts for the tolls!"
"Regularly used, could lead to neurotoxicity. Explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues.","On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown."
"Fake name, fake prescription.","Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name's real. This guy's just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids."
Mark's a high school guidance counselor.,And Mr. Brown's birth date makes him 17-years-old. You think maybe these were confisCated by a high school guidance counselor? Anything else?
"Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking to yoga, could have been indication """,He's getting older. What did the CSF say about encephalitis?
"Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells, no white cells, serology's negative.",Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.
I told her he didn't have it. The marker tests were negative.,"Well, then you should have told her that. He could still have it. PET scan will rEveal any change in metabolic activity in the cerebral cortex, run him through. And check his memory."
"Yeah. First we're gonna map out some specific brain functions, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive. Checking up on me?",I like all the pretty lights.
Find a mailbox and mail it.,"Jeez, what a guy. His frontal lobe is working way better than mine. You remember when you got married?"
"Three years ago this July, who is that?",What? There could be a pRoblem with his long-term memory. Big church wedding?
Is that House?,He remembers voices.
This serves no diagnostic purpose.,"I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there. Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough. Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?"
Was she thinking of you? Is that what you medically need to know?,What jewelry did your bride wear?
"She nEver wears any jewelry. Except that cross her mother gave to her. No underwear, either. At least, not that day. I remember because she ripped her pretty, white dress off in the car. Is that the sort of answer you're looking for, Doctor?",I think I upset him.
I remember the Honeymoon was in Paris. I remember because we didn't leave the room for two weeks. You want the details on that?,A little defensive.
It's not paranoia if someone's out to get you.,Here we go.
"He's sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?","The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system """
"Elevate the words all you want, you were just screwing with him. Low Even by your standards.",Medical screwing. It's what I do.
And then you run away like a 12-year-old. Go hide on the roof like you always do.,"I haven't been up here in five years. I don't know what's wrong with him. It's not Alzheimer's, it's not encephalitis, it's not environmental, it's not immunological. Every test is negative, Every time. He's perfectly healthy, but his brain is dying."
It nEver occurred to me that you couldn't figure out what's wrong.,I haven't given up.
So what do we do?,We wait.
For what?,"Something to change. It's one of the great tragEdies of life, something always , something always changes."
What's happening?,Time marches on. He's paralyzed.
"But he's experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can't move his hands or toes.","It's peripheral. Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain."
"No, no. I already did an indirect Coombs' test. No glutination, no antibodies!",Initiative! Like that. Start him on IV immunosuppress
"No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-Barre, period!",Period? More like dot dot dot. What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?
"Come on, the chances of that are ""","I didn't ask about the Vegas line, I said ""what if?"""
So we either fight it for him or it's fatal.,Fatal sounds very bad to me.
But without the antibodies we can't Even test for it. We don't know if we're right.,"The treatment isn't all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG. If it works, we're right. If he dies, it was something else."
"Mark, what you're feeling, it's not real. It's the virus. Mark? His throat's closing up, he can't breathe. Code blue! He's having a reaction to the IVIG, I need epi stat! I can't get the scope in his throat!",Stop that.
He's having an allergic reaction and he's crashing!,"No, he's not. Look at his vitals. O2 stats are within range. I'm betting the only abnormal sign is sweaty palms. Push two milligrams Ativan. Just a panic attack. Something obviously freaked him out. Can we talk now?"
You couldn't just walk into the room?,"He's had five visitors drive down. I didn't recognize any of them. Six more have sent him flowers, candy and a teddy bear, which I'm sure he finds very comforting. But I didn't recognize any of the names on the cards."
"Shockingly, Mark has friends, and I have some new ones.","No, it's not shocking that you have new friends. But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones."
I haven't.,"No, I didn't think so. I just think you didn't tell any of them that you were down here. Now why would that be? Why would you not tell your oldest friends that you were taking Mark to Princeton-Plainsboro TeaParkng Hospital to try to save his life?"
I've been busy! I haven't kept track of who knows what.,"See, my old friends are telling me to be careful. They seem to think """
He. And he sent me the bear.,"Figures. He seems to think that I'm not over you. It might be dangerous for me to spend time with you. I'm thinking your friends might have similar concerns. And so you didn't tell him you'd be here, with me."
What's your point? That I'm still in love with you? I should abandon my dying husband and we should head for Rio?,No.
What's up?,"Love the bear, it was adorable."
"My wife's going to kill me. We're having company, she cooked.","I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment."
I'm sorry.,"I was happy. He's my Patient. I'm sure he's a good guy, he's pRobably a great guy. PRobably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I'm just not sure if it's because I want to be with her or if it's because I want her to suffer."
"I was happy. He's my Patient. I'm sure he's a good guy, he's pRobably a great guy. PRobably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I'm just not sure if it's because I want to be with her or if it's because I want her to suffer.",Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?
"I'll be just outside, Honey.",You two are good together.
You know nothing about Mark.,"He took you to Paris, that's good enough for me."
We nEver went to Paris.,"Your Honeymoon. It's been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you."
"No, I had to work. We spent the night in New York, then went back to Short Hills. What is it?",When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?
"About a month ago. The same time he started getting sick, what does that mean?",We have two more symptoms.
We have two more symptoms.,Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.
You grilled him about Stacy.,"WhatEver. Yeah, point is he told us Everything we needed to know to diagnose him, that is if we use your fancy PET scan as a lie detector. See, it's a very creative process, lying. Now, telling the truth is a much simpler process. See here. Question nine, this is where Mark gives a long, rambling answer about taking Stacy to Paris. What does the PET scan say?"
"He said he went to Paris and the PET confirms it, so what?","They didn't go. They didn't go to Paris, and yet Mark's brain apparently thinks that he really did spend 40 francs on a tour of the Bastille. So we have an intermittent syndrome that presents with abdominal pain, polyneuropathy, paranoia and delusions. Now, here's the thing about Acute Intermittent Porphyria. It'll jump you in a dark alley, beat the crap out of you, leave you bleeding. But it leaves gloves, so no fingerprints. Doesn't show up in blood tests, urine tests, nothing. Unless you catch it red handed in the middle of an attack."
But there are other symptoms of AIP.,Such as?
Light sensitivity?,"Yeah, well, one of the true tragEdies of this condition is it makes you want to stick your cool, new mountain bike in the garage and take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga. Start the treatment: hematin and glucose."
And there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.,Sure there is.
Sure there is.,"Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers. Barbiturates, alcohol, high lEvels of protein set off an attack."
Which trigger do you think set off Mark's?,"Not the faintest idea, that's why I'm going to give him the combo plate."
"So if he has this, and you trigger the attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?",Yeah. But then we'll know what it is and we can treat it.
What if I don't have this thing and you give me that shot? What happens?,No idea. If we don't know what's messing up your brain we don't know how you'll react.
"Okay, I need a minute with my husband. He doesn't want the trigger. He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation. If it is the AIP, how much time does he have?","No idea. Next attack could be fatal. Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now."
I want you to test him.,"Fine. I'll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month."
"Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.",No.
Why not?,Because he doesn't want me to.
I'm not going to sue you. I'm not going to report you.,He might.
"He's paralyzed! Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.",I'm not gonna do it.
Why not?,"You keep asking me that question; my answer doesn't change. I gave him the parameters, it's his call."
You want him to die.,"I diagnosed him, I did my job. You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you're way better at that than I am."
Is that what this is? Payback for your leg? How Many times have we been over this; I saved your life.,"Yeah, maybe."
You're going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?,"No, he's going to die because he's too stubborn to make the right choice."
Now we're in your territory.,"I'm respecting your husband's decision, I don't see why you've got a pRoblem with that."
"Because it's crap! Because you browbeat Patients, intimidate them, lie to them. If you think you're right you don't give a damn what they think. I did what you do all the time, the only difference is I did it to you.",He'll nEver forgive you.
Not like you do. I only met him when he drugged me.,"Boy, are my ears burning."
What's that?,Cocktail hour. Just because you can't hoist a few doesn't mean you should be left out.
I don't.,Smart. Too bad you're paralyzed. Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman! Leave the room. It's not your pRoblem.
You need the consent from him.,"Doc, he ain't right in the head!"
Then you need a court order.,"Okay, then get one. We'll wait here. I won't do nothin'. Oh, love the Musketeer thing. I got goosebumps."
"Please, if you're right this may be his only shot.","So what's your plan? You take the big, dark one, I've got the little girl and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things turn rough. I can't do it."
You son of a bitch!,See what I did there?
"If he had AIP, it should have already happened.",Everyone's different.
Is that an attack?,"No, you'll pollute the sample! Chase, get urine from the catheter."
He needs Ativan!,This is not a stroke! Delta wave bursts just at the base of the spasm.
"Heart rate's in the 40s, bradycardia, we're losing him!",Hold him down!
Give him something!,No pain killers!
You were wrong!,"Straight from the bladder, that's as fresh as it gets. Will you give him the Ativan already? He doesn't need to be awake for this."
It's still yellow.,Move.
You think another light's gonna make the difference?,"Organic chem.. More lights, more oxidation. Ring any bells? Start the Patient on 150 milligrams glucose, 75 milligrams hematin."
Dr. House? How's he doing?,NEver better.
You fixed him.,De nada.
Thank you. You were right.,He's gonna be fine.
"No, about me. I'm not over you. You were, you were the one, you always will be. But I can't be with you.","So I'm the guy, but you want the other guy, who by definition can nEver be the guy."
"What's so great about you, you always think you're right. What's so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time. You are brilliant, funny, surprising, sexy! but with you I was lonely, and with Mark there's room for me.",Okay.
I want to run something by you.,"I will not have sex with you! Not again! Miserable, that first time. All that desperate, administrative need """
"Stacy's husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital. And since we can definitely use her back here, I've offered her a job. General Counsel.",Did she say yes?
She said only if it was okay with you. Yes or no?,Fine. Good.
